[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monroe Inc. Earnings Conference Call
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.780]   for the third quarter fiscal 2020.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.140]   At this time, all participants are on a listen only mode.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.900]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.900]   time.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.580]   If anyone should require assistance during the call, please press star zero on your touch
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.580]   tone phone.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.460]   As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded and may not be reproduced in
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.720]   whole or in part without permission from the company.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.500]   I would now like to introduce Ms. Maureen Mulholland, Senior Vice President, General
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.020]   Counsel and Secretary Monroe.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.020]   Thank you.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.420]   Please go ahead.
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.420]   Thank you.
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.300]   Hello everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's call.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.220]   Before we get started, please note that as part of the call this morning, we will be referencing
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:01:02.080]   a presentation that is available on the Investors section of our website at corporate.monro.com/investors/investor-resources.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.280]   If I could draw your attention to the Safe Harbor Statement on slide two of the presentation,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.240]   I'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.280]   looking statements about Monroe's future performance.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.240]   Political results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.020]   The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monroe's filings
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.920]   with the SEC and in our earnings release.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.280]   The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.520]   whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   law.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.820]   Additionally, on today's call, management statements include a discussion of certain non-gap financial
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.840]   measures which are intended to supplement and not be substitutes for comparable gap measures.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.200]   Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable gap measures will be included
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.800]   as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.320]   With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.600]   Brett Ponton.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.960]   Thank you, Maureen and good morning, everyone.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.400]   I'll get started today with a brief overview of our third quarter results followed by an
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.720]   update on the progress we've made on our Monroe forward strategy.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.800]   As illustrated on slide three, we reported comps down 0.9 percent in the third quarter
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.360]   as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.960]   In October and the beginning of November, we performed well against difficult comparisons
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.840]   in the prior year.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.440]   Mild weather conditions towards the end of November and in December caused a slowdown
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.760]   across our core northern markets.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.680]   These conditions have continued into January with our comparable store sales down 4 percent
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.680]   during the month.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.080]   We do not like talking about the weather; however, it is impossible to ignore the impact it has
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   on our business.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.400]   While we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter, we are executing well
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.320]   against the areas within our control.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.720]   In particular, we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and are confident
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.800]   we are on the right path.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.040]   We are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.080]   deliver strong results no matter the external circumstances.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.480]   We agreed onto our performance by category in the third quarter.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.080]   We were down 1 percent year over year and the entire comparable store sales as higher ticket
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   year over year was offset by a decline in tire volume.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.560]   We experienced more normalized retail pricing this quarter and are focused on further refining
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.960]   our tire strategy to drive strength in our largest category.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.160]   Importantly, we are on track to roll out our tire category management and pricing system
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.560]   approach to real-time pricing.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.000]   I will provide more details on this shortly.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.680]   Turning to our service and repair categories, we saw a 3 percent decline in brakes year over
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.520]   year, falling short of a difficult comparison in the third quarter last year.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.760]   In maintenance, we were flat while front-end shocks were down 1 percent and alignments
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.520]   decline 3 percent year over year.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.960]   Overall, our southern markets outperformed our northern markets as expected given the mild
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.840]   winter weather conditions we faced in this region.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.000]   New stores added $22.7 million in revenue during the quarter including $20.7 million from recent
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.800]   acquisitions.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.920]   Regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter, we saw a decline of 20 basis
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.720]   points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.120]   sales which resulted in higher fixed cost of the percentage of sales.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.280]   Our variable margin on the other hand expanded due to lower year over year material cost
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.200]   as a percentage of sales while slightly higher than the prior year quarter technician labor
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.640]   as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.880]   This is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.000]   We identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.120]   action to drive improved results.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.280]   We will have additional opportunities to continue to improve results in this area as we implement
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.640]   our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.160]   which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust the changes and demand dynamics without
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.760]   sacrificing sales.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.440]   I now like to turn to the progress we made in our Monroe Forward Strategy beginning with
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.200]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative on slide four.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.080]   This initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.760]   standardized in-store operating procedures which we call our Monroe Playbook.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.120]   Additionally, we are rebranding select stores to a tire oriented banner where targeted
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.680]   demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.080]   service revenues.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.360]   During the first half of fiscal 2020 we finalized the transformations of our first group of stores
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.880]   which includes 44 locations in Rochester, New York and Mid-Atlantic as well as the second
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.200]   group which includes 43 stores in our southern market.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.600]   During the third quarter we continue to scale this initiative across our base and move forward
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.760]   with the transformation of 74 stores in four markets and 42 of our recently acquired California
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.380]   stores.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.000]   We have completed the transformation of the 74 stores and have substantially completed our
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.680]   California stores which are being rebranded under our Tire Choice Auto Service Center banner
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.920]   to drive higher awareness for tires.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.440]   Turning to slide five, I'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.160]   rationale as we transform our store base.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.520]   As many of you know, we operate in two store formats.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.760]   Our service brand stores which generate approximately $600,000 per store in annualized sales and our
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:27.040]   tire brand stores which generate approximately $1.2 million per store in annualized sales.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.360]   Prior to any rebrand activity we operated 555 service brand stores and 734 tire brand
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.360]   stores.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.200]   As we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores we are prioritizing
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.960]   the higher volume tire brand.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.040]   Throughout this process we will be consolidating our regional brands focusing on shifting our
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.560]   service brands over the tire brands.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.760]   The lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.280]   When we speak to re-imaging stores this primarily means modernizing the appearance of our stores
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.880]   with no associated brand change.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.000]   As we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re-imaging stores we are leveraging
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.360]   our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.120]   Looking at the bottom left of the slide you can see here the progress we have made so
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   far.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.520]   We are very much in the early innings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.040]   completed out of our portfolio.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.440]   We separated these stores out between comp stores and non comp stores which helps us to evaluate
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.880]   their performance post refresh.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:43.960]   Of our approximately 900 comp stores we set out to transform we completed 134 stores and
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.280]   of our approximately 150 non comp stores we substantially completed 69.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.120]   As we move forward with expanding this program across our base we will continue to prioritize
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.760]   markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and our approach
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.680]   will be measured in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.320]   Through the end of this fiscal year we are focusing on finalizing the transformation of our recently
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.960]   acquired California stores while starting the transformation of approximately 80 more stores
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.520]   that will be completed in Q1 of FY21.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.960]   Moving on to the performance of the stores we completed so far to help provide some additional
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.520]   granularity we separated out how rebrand stores have performed versus the stores that have
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.600]   just been re-imaged.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   Importantly this data only includes comp stores have had a full quarter of performance following
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.280]   the completion of their transformation.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:48.800]   This is how we will speak to this performance of our transformed stores moving forward.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.560]   As you can see and in line with our expectations we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.560]   stores.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.720]   This shift optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sales without sacrificing
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.840]   our service revenues.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.400]   The stores that have been re-imaged were slightly down as these are located in our northern markets
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.040]   which were impacted by the mild weather conditions I mentioned earlier.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.160]   We believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.480]   to come with a streamlined brand portfolio.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.800]   The 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation given
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.880]   they have not had a full quarter post transformation yet but we are still we are seeing early signs
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.600]   of strength to these stores and are pleased with the results.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.880]   While we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base the sustained
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.720]   performance we've seen at the stores that have completed the transformation today underscores
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.200]   the impact of this important initiative.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.880]   Coming to slide six and the remainder of our Monroe Forward initiatives I'd like to focus
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.220]   my discussion on the initiatives that are top priority which we believe will be critical
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.760]   to supporting our broader strategy.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.860]   In a third quarter we began modernizing our store IT infrastructure at all of our approximately
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.360]   1300 locations.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.600]   This new infrastructure enables state-of-the-art technology including our new digital phone
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   and texting system which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.360]   This system will allow us to better track customer execution, driving a more consistent phone
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.720]   strategy and improve conversions.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.460]   Our store infrastructure modernization will be completed by the end of the first quarter
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.840]   of fiscal 2021 allowing us to leverage our new phone system which will be critical to
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.000]   driving traffic to our stores.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.360]   Another priority for us is the optimization of our entire category management.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.600]   We are on track and by the end of this fiscal year we expect our new pricing software will
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.280]   be operational.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:02.240]   We believe this will be critical to driving long-term margin expansion by providing improved visibility
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.600]   into demand dynamics allowing us to better refine our assortments and execute our strategy
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.860]   to become the number one destination for tires at any price point.
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.240]   Finally we are right on track to roll out our cloud-based core scheduling model pilot
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   by year-end.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.600]   Gaining real-time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.340]   and strategic ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales or overstaffed when there
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.680]   is a lack of demand.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.360]   Regarding our other teammate initiatives we have rolled out the Monroe University program
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.720]   to all of our teammates and are continuing to expand and enhance the course content.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.580]   We've also implemented mandatory onboard training to ensure that everyone who joins our team
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:52.320]   is trained on our Monroe playbook operating procedures in order to provide a quality five-star
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.120]   experience to our customers.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.920]   Moving on to slide seven while we are very focused on the rollout of Monroe Forward acquisitions
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.200]   remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.760]   During the quarter we closed the previously announced acquisitions of three companies.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.040]   One with 14 locations in Las Vegas, Nevada and four in Boise, Idaho, as well as two companies
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.280]   that include nine stores in Northern California, further solidifying our growing position in
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.480]   the western United States.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.960]   Our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts as well as benefit
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:31.360]   from the high concentration of vehicles in this market and the potential long-term consumership
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.080]   to ride sharing.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.920]   The acquisition in Nevada and Idaho, which are new states to Monroe is expected to add
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.940]   approximately 20 million in annualized sales, represented sales mix of 75 percent service
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.120]   and 25 percent tires.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.520]   The acquisitions in California are expected to add approximately 25 million in annualized
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:56.400]   sales, represented sales mix of 55 percent service and 45 percent tires.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:04.160]   These acquisitions are expected to be diluted to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.100]   All acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent and expected
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.560]   120 million in annualized sales.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.920]   We operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.160]   and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.760]   M&A targets.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.320]   We currently have over 10 NDA signed with opportunities ranging from five to 40 stores,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.720]   which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.320]   while continuing to expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.080]   Further, by continuing to execute our Monroe Forward initiatives, including our new brand
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.720]   standards and operating procedures, we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.280]   and efficiently.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:00.560]   Lastly, we open one green field location during third quarter bringing our total green field
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.640]   store openings to seven in fiscal 2020.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.680]   In conclusion, we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in our
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.680]   business.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.680]   We are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.480]   a platform capable of delivering sustainable long-term growth.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:25.440]   We are not there yet nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the transformation.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.040]   But we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business, making the
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.880]   appropriate course corrections when necessary, and executing well against the areas within
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880]   our control.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.120]   I'd like to thank the entire team at Monroe for their exceptional work as we execute this
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.760]   strategy, as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.040]   With that, I'll turn the call over to our executive vice president, chief financial officer and
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.000]   treasurer, Brian Deembrosia, who will provide additional detail on our third quarter financial
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.400]   performance and fiscal 2020 outlook.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.840]   Thank you, Brett, and good morning, everyone.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.440]   Turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter, sales increased 6.2% year over
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:16.840]   year to $329.3 million, driven by sales from new stores of $22.7 million, including $20.7
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.880]   million from recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.000]   of approximately $0.8 million.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.040]   Time-store sales in the quarter were down 0.9% year over year.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:37.560]   The third quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days, in line with the previous year period.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:45.640]   Growth margin decreased 20 basis points to 37.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 from 38%
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   in the prior year period.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.600]   This decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:04.240]   However, as Brett mentioned, we saw improvements in our variable margin, driven by lower material
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.120]   costs as a percentage of sales.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:15.560]   Operating expenses for the quarter increased $5.5 million to $92.8 million or 28.2% of sales
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:22.680]   is compared with $87.3 million or 28.1% of sales for the prior year period.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.880]   The year over year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net new stores.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:36.320]   Our operating income for the third quarter was $31.6 million, which increased by 2.8%
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:42.520]   as compared to operating income of $30.7 million for the same quarter last year and decreased
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.960]   as a percentage of sales from 9.9% to 9.6%.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:55.040]   Net interest expense for the third quarter increased $.2 million to $7 million as compared to $6.8
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.880]   million in the same period last year.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.160]   The weighted average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.200]   approximately $112 million as compared to the prior year period.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.560]   The increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease debt recorded in connection
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:19.160]   with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions and green field expansion, as well as an increase in debt
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.400]   outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund the purchase of our acquisition.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.440]   The weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately 140 basis
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.600]   points year over year due to lower LIBOR and prime interest rates, as well as lower borrowing
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.920]   rates associated with new leases.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.400]   Our effective tax rate was 24.1% for the third quarter compared to 15.3% for the same period
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   last year.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:51.960]   The year over year increase is primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit adjustment
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.280]   we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change, which
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.900]   was related to certain deductions that the IRS accepted during the examination of our
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.320]   fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 tax return.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:13.720]   That income for the third quarter was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the prior
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.320]   year period.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.360]   Deluded earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 56 cents compared to deluded
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   earnings per share of 61 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.760]   Adjusted deluded earnings per share, which is a non-gap measure for the third quarter of
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:38.360]   fiscal 2020, was 60 cents, which excludes from deluded earnings per share three cents of costs
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.480]   related to Monroe Forward Initiatives and one cent of costs related to acquisition due diligence
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.080]   and integration.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.880]   This compares to adjusted deluded earnings per share of 57 cents in the third quarter
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:55.880]   of fiscal 2019, which excluded one cent of costs related to Monroe Forward Initiatives,
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.560]   one cent of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs, and six cents
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.320]   benefit from the one-time income tax adjustment.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.960]   For more information on this non-gap measure, please see the reconciliation of adjusted deluded
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.640]   earnings per share to deluded earnings per share in our earnings release.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.080]   Lastly, we opened one greenfield location during the third quarter.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.700]   As a reminder, greenfield stores include new construction, as well as the acquisition
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.600]   of one-to-four store operations.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.400]   Greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately $1 million each in annual
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   sales.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:41.060]   As of December 28, 2019, the company had 1,289 company-operated stores and 99 franchise locations,
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:49.960]   as compared with 1,186 company-operated stores and 99 franchise locations as of December 29,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   2018.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:57.140]   During the third quarter, we added 27 company-operated stores and closed none.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:02.440]   Joining to Slide 9, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.000]   as we execute our growth strategy.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.280]   Our capital expenditures were $42.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, of
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:17.440]   which approximately $18 million was related to investment in our Monroe Forward Initiatives.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.840]   We are pleased with the progress of our Monroe Forward Strategy and we continue to expect
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.880]   an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years to
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.560]   support investments in story image and technology.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.720]   Additionally, accretive acquisitions support our growth strategy.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:45.120]   During the first nine months of the year, we spent approximately $104 million on acquisitions,
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.880]   including one-to-four store acquisitions completed as part of our greenfield expansion strategy.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.960]   As Brett mentioned, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.440]   represent an expected $120 million in annualized sales.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.680]   I'd like to provide some additional clarity here.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.960]   The $120 million in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:15.320]   fully integrated, which as we stated in the past, is usually in year three post-acquisition.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:20.480]   During years one and two following the acquisition, we typically see a step down in sales given
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.280]   the process of onboarding new stores to our model.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.020]   Moving on, we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:34.520]   program and paid approximately $22 million in dividends in the first nine months of fiscal
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.520]   2020.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.520]   Finally, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.120]   to support our strategic growth initiatives.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.880]   We entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.120]   covenant.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.440]   We generated approximately $125 million of cash flow from operating activities during
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:00.280]   the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and debt under our revolving credit facility increased
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.080]   by approximately $59 million.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:10.540]   Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide 10, we have updated our fiscal 2020
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:16.280]   comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of 1 percent to flat to reflect the impact
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.240]   of our year-to-day performance.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.620]   Based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:31.400]   closed acquisition, we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1,275 million
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:40.960]   to $1,290 million, an increase of 6.2 percent to 7.5 percent as compared to fiscal 2019 sales.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:49.500]   This compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1,295 million to $1,315 million.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:54.200]   Our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.720]   2020.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:02.280]   Given the impact of our year-to-day performance, we expect fiscal 2020 earnings for diluted share
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:10.920]   to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 representing a decline of 5.1 percent to 0.8 percent.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:17.120]   year-over-year compared to $2.37 in fiscal 2019.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:23.440]   This compares to the previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.55.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.580]   On an adjusted basis, which is a non-gap measure, the company expects diluted earnings per share
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:38.480]   to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 representing a decline of 1.7 percent to growth of 2.5 percent
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.520]   which excludes from diluted earnings per share Monroe Forward Initiative costs and acquisition
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.200]   due diligence and integration costs.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:53.240]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.39 in fiscal 2019 which excluded
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.960]   Monroe Forward Initiative costs, non-recurring corporate and field management realignment
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:03.720]   costs, acquisition due diligence and integration costs, and the benefit from the one-time income
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.200]   tax adjustment.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:11.320]   Conditions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be diluted to earnings
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.920]   per share during the year.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:19.520]   At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect an operating margin of approximately 10.2 percent,
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:25.560]   interest expense to be approximately $29 million, depreciation and amortization to be approximately
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:31.480]   $65 million, and EBITDA to be approximately $196 million.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.040]   We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million this year.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.080]   This guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5 percent and is based
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.040]   on 34 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.040]   As always, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or Greenfield store openings.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.080]   I'll now turn the call over to Brott to provide some closing remarks before we move to Q&A.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.880]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.240]   We are making solid strides in the execution of our Monroe Forward Strategy in particular
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.360]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.480]   The strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore our
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.840]   confidence in this initiative.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.720]   The store rebrand and reimage program is further supported by our technological investments which
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.960]   we believe will help drive long-term margin expansion.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.560]   In summary, we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.760]   making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.560]   areas within our control.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.440]   We are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   ahead.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.240]   With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   Thank you.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.240]   At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session.

[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.320]   Our first question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.320]   Please go ahead.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   Good morning.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   Morning, Brian.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   So I want to focus on the weather here, but I do want to dive deeper into sales trends
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   in the quarter.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.560]   You mentioned, I think Brian did too, in your prepared comments.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:33.120]   You made some commentaries suggesting that to the degree to which weather impacted the
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.120]   business.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.280]   I wonder if you can drill down a little further and say what that negative .9 comp would have
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:44.640]   been had the weather cooperated and some of the other metrics you are seeing that really
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.800]   suggest the underlying business is trending better than what we saw in the weather affected
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.800]   fiscal queue three.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:57.080]   I will take the first part and I will let Brian take the second part of the question, Brian.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:02.880]   When we look at the performance in the quarter, as we talked about our northern markets certainly
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.240]   underperform the southern markets and give you a little more granularity on that, certainly
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:15.080]   our stores up in the northeast and the Midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.040]   to weather conditions like you have in the northeast certainly underperform.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.580]   I think it is difficult to say what we would have done.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.040]   I think we are expecting positive comps in the quarter.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:37.560]   Our internal expectations would have been closer to +1 to +1.5 assuming normalized weather conditions
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.160]   that we have seen in the past.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.420]   We felt really good coming out of October and November given the strength of last year's
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:51.880]   performance we were hoping against and didn't get the cooperation from the weather in December
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.720]   that we were certainly expecting.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.440]   As I made the comments in my preparatory remarks we certainly don't like talking about the weather
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:06.160]   Brian but we can't ignore the fact that when 50% of our business is tires and we have a high
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.440]   concentration of stores in the northeast and Midwest we are going to have outsized exposure
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.440]   to our comp performance.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:20.760]   Brian, would you mind restating the second part of your question?
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:26.760]   I think you covered – maybe I'll just follow a question if I could.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:32.600]   The guide – the adjusted guidance then you mentioned so in January you did a -4.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:38.320]   Now if I am doing the math it looks as though the adjusted guidance would suggest some type
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.160]   of pickup then in business and February and March so I guess the first question is that
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:48.500]   assumption correct and then the following question is – I know we've seen this before
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:54.040]   with your business but at what point does – because we still have a long – we have
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.360]   potentially a long term in the winter the weather could still come but is there a point at which
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:03.440]   in the quarter where the weather just comes too late?
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:12.280]   Yeah so Brian your assumption is correct regarding the implied comp so if you think about Q4 at
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:19.440]   the midpoint of let's say down point five for the full year down point five that implies
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:25.360]   Q4 of down two which would be about February and March being down one in order to get to
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.680]   that down two so that's the dynamic at the midpoint so there is an expectation of a pickup
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.680]   in February and March.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:39.780]   Brian maybe just a comment on the second part as we get deeper into the fourth quarter
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:44.660]   or fourth quarter the second half of the quarter in particular I think we become less sensitive
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:53.760]   to the weather as you transition out of say pure winter conditions into spring certainly
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:00.000]   I think the later in the quarter you get snowfall certainly doesn't have the same impact on
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.540]   entire demands like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in October or November.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:12.260]   Years are pretty frifty with their money and I believe you get snowfall late in the season
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:18.380]   they have a tendency to forego that purchase and push it out until next season in particular.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.840]   The other thing to call out as well as if you look at our historic performance at the
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:30.320]   company December and January have always been the most volatile month that we had to contend
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:36.460]   with and I think what we've seen in past performance here friends coming out of December
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:44.420]   January don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring month so given the mild December
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:50.380]   January heading into the balance of the quarter we feel pretty good about the guidance range
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:56.240]   we provided as Brian said our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our comp sales guidance
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.180]   it assumes run rate coming out of January which we certainly believe we're going to be better
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:05.340]   than that as we roll into FY 21.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.180]   I appreciate all the color thank you.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.180]   Thanks Brian.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.180]   Thank you.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:16.280]   Our next question is coming from Jonathan Lamers of BMO Capital Markets please go ahead.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:25.260]   Thanks Brett looking at your slide on the door rebranding you know the 18% performance
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:29.700]   of the rebranded stores I think is good.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:34.700]   I'm curious from your analytic model how many years should it take a rebranded store
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:40.300]   to reach projected run rate sales?
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:48.620]   If you look at the top quadrant of that slide Jonathan we've shared with investors the fact
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.500]   that our service stores do roughly $600,000 in revenue and our tire stores do $1,000,000
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.500]   too.
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.260]   So in the case where we're rebranding a service store you're working off the base on average
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:06.740]   of $600,000 and if we've seen a double digit comp improvement off of that base you can get
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:13.540]   to implied numbers certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp to the full
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:20.020]   maturity equally in the average sales performance of our tire branded stores.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.660]   That's one of the things that's encouraging about the strategy for us is not that it's
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:30.820]   just a one-time step up in sales, this creates the opportunity to create multiple years of
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:39.100]   sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning our brand related tires starts to mature.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:44.100]   Keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:49.300]   So if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires we won't be relevant
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out so to put that on a timeline and
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:00.200]   if you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature out to average sales performance
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.180]   of the tire branded store.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:09.540]   Okay so just to circle up on that for the stores where you're rebranding there's nothing
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:17.660]   about their market like you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.180]   your existing tire brand stores at the 1.2 million is that correct?
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:26.860]   Yeah as a general statement that's correct I think certainly you're going to have markets
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:32.780]   that will exceed the average and you'll have some markets that will be lower than that and
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:38.820]   that's part of the choices that we may be using the analytic model but on average as we look
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:45.440]   across our I'll say the opportunity stores that be in the 555 I think we feel very comfortable
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:52.020]   on average that we can reach the full potential of the 1.2 over time as they mature.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:35:02.020]   Thanks switching gears Brian how much of a headwind to that revenue from acquisitions
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.780]   were the conversions of the 42 California stores this quarter?
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:15.660]   Yeah I mean we have you know some disruption there I would say you know we haven't really
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:21.540]   quantified that from a sales standpoint but you know it's a great point Jonathan in that
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:27.180]   we have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the Monroe playbook and then
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:34.440]   shortly thereafter and in this case about six months get the reimage in store brand standards
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:42.680]   in place so those the in Q3 the 42 California stores went through that and they're substantially
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:49.760]   through that as of the end of Q3 but we haven't quantified it but it certainly had some impact
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.640]   on their sales performance in the quarter.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:00.160]   Okay and that $1.8 million charge for Monroe forward initiative this quarter what was that
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.320]   for?
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:09.560]   Yeah it was all related to the store rebrand and reimage and it falls into three primary
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:17.960]   buckets related to that the first is non capital items that we send to the stores so as we think
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:25.840]   about updated safety chains updated Bay banners updated point of sale marketing materials
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:33.000]   all of these things to get the store initially to the standard that are not capital in terms
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.280]   of the actual work and construction done on the store that's the first bucket the second
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:45.320]   bucket is non capital work that's actually done we get into these stores and we identified
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:55.160]   non capital repairs demolition as well as some of the fixed verse replace items for example
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:00.880]   stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing a new floor those are things that
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.980]   make sense economically but you get different treatment from expense versus capital four
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.480]   so that's the second bucket and the third is just right off of existing leaseholds in
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:17.100]   the stores anything from counters to maybe some existing signage that was put up as part
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.120]   of an acquisition when we initially branded the stores over to a Monroe brand those are
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:29.280]   the three primary buckets that the Monroe forward initiative cost consists of okay thanks
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:36.440]   for your comment thank you are excuse me our next question is coming from Brett Jordan
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:43.720]   of Jeffries please go ahead hey good morning guys morning we're back back to slide five
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:49.420]   I guess if we look at the 18% growth and rebranded stores if we really sort of look at the comparable
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:54.860]   growth there you know x the new product lines you're adding how's the service comp against
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:38:00.680]   the service comp in those stores are you seeing you know pick up as you change the brand yeah
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.840]   maybe just to clarify though Brad I think we're actually not adding any new products to the
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:13.200]   service menu right but you're adding tires right yeah it's just mixed right so we even
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:19.040]   our service stores they sell tires it's only 15% or mix so we're certainly seeing growth
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:27.120]   more outsize growth in their tire sales and we've had success in maintaining the rate of
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:33.840]   growth that we've seen on the service side which has been part of our thesis is hold on to the
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:39.320]   service business that we've enjoyed that's high margin and then add to that more relevancy
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:45.000]   to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the tire category we're seeing growth
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.640]   on both sides okay and I guess we look at the reimage how does that compare to you know
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.480]   comparable service stores in the network that hadn't been re-imaged I guess sort of looking
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:02.720]   at it again sort of apples to apples you know against the old stores yeah I think if you
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.560]   can figure out which stores we're talking about there the 30 stores of Rochester and I think
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.740]   yeah the Rochester stores certainly if they have been performing quite well relative to what
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:17.920]   our expectations were on re-image we certainly didn't expect to see double-digit growth rates
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:24.120]   out of our re-image store we set out to do this initiative but we were seeing more positive
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:29.380]   growth out of the stores up until the last quarter given the exposure that we've had to the weather
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:34.920]   in the north but compared other stores we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:40.160]   customer service point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:46.460]   facing similar I would say market backdrop from a weather point of view okay could you
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:51.060]   give us I guess sort of the spread between the southern store cop and the northern store
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:59.300]   cop you know how big a delta was it I mean it was it was a couple hundred basis points
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:07.460]   of performance okay and I guess for housekeeping could you give us the monthly oh yeah so we
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:16.920]   were one second here breath we were down 1.2 in October down 1.7 in November and up point
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:23.840]   four in December okay and then one just this is sorry I had the questions on the supply
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:27.860]   chain side I mean just to throw the virus into it since that's popular these days you guys
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:33.100]   do a lot of direct sourcing you know the the white box product out of China do you see any
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:40.540]   impact on supply chain from what's going on we haven't seen any to this point threat we're
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:46.820]   obviously working through contingency plans which we have had to develop actually related
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:53.380]   to the tariff issues so we feel pretty confident that through the network of your multiple
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:59.220]   supply points that we'll be able to overcome any particular issues coming from the virus
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:18.300]   okay thanks a lot guys okay thanks red thank you our next question is coming from Rick Nelson
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:28.820]   of Stevens please go ahead thanks good morning follow up on the weather last year I think
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:37.820]   December January you also pointed to mild winter weather do you think this year was incrementally
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:47.040]   worse than the prior year I think if you look at you know analyst reports that we've seen
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:52.020]   talking about I guess the impact that the mild winter has had on not only our category
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:59.980]   but other retail like the data would indicate that this has been more mild certainly versus
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:05.580]   last year I think we look at precipitation which is very important for us the form of
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:12.260]   snow with our tire business certainly it's been a much more mild winter this year relative
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:23.580]   to last year any updates on your partnership with Amazon what you're seeing there on the
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:35.860]   install side and how you think your tire prices compared to theirs and entire category overall
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:45.660]   I'm curious about what happened with units in the period and market share yeah so let's
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:54.460]   start with units where units were down to average selling price was up one for the for
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:43:00.460]   the quarter how that compares we don't have a lot of syndicated data course we can look
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:07.100]   to and be definitive on that we lean on I guess our channel checks and information from
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:13.020]   our tire manufacturers that have good visibility across multiple brands and feels like similar
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:19.060]   to other companies that have exposure to the north particular northeast to the degree
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:24.700]   that we do feel like we are probably in line with what we picked up through suppliers
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:31.980]   and others as relates to Amazon I think we're still pleased with our relationship with them
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:39.820]   as well as other online tire retailers we we will eventually expand the relationship
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:48.020]   and apply 21 include all stores we talked about last quarter priority has been what I mentioned
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:54.020]   on today's call completing the tire category management pricing tool as well as the labor
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:44:00.380]   scheduling tool that are just for our organization on a higher priority at this stage than expanding
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:06.380]   but we are committed to expand that relationship going forward related tire pricing as you
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:12.180]   know Rick the entire category is very complicated you have you know over 30,000 SKUs that you
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.740]   need to manage effectively across multiple markets and one of the reasons why we've invested
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:22.580]   in the tire category management tool is to do a couple of things one is give us much better
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:30.700]   visibility into demand dynamics defined by elasticity down to a skew level and by having
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:34.940]   that visibility it's going to create a much more granular approach that we're going to
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:43.140]   use for pricing allow us to price at the skew level in our industry with the intent being
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:49.540]   strike that right balance between driving the right price to drive unit volume while preserving
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:55.940]   and expanding our entire margins through our right next at right price I'm encouraged we're
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:05.020]   in pilot form of that now we will be operational by Q1 of next year fully operational the rollout
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:09.340]   of that's pretty small in scale because we control our pricing centrally so small team
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:15.140]   of people will be trained up on using that system so between now and Q1 will be testing in parallel
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:20.700]   and makes certain we're confident with the results we're seeing from the system.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:26.660]   That makes sense thanks for the color and good luck.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.060]   Thanks Rick.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.060]   Thank you.
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.260]   Once again ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask a question please press star one
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.020]   on your telephone keypad.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.820]   Our next question is coming from Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey please
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:39.820]   go ahead.
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.780]   Hi good morning thank you for the question.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:48.900]   Good morning I wanted to go back I know in the prior quarters when you started rolling
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:54.500]   out some of these store refreshes you called out a hit or headwind to comp during that quarter
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:59.020]   really just from distraction you know it makes sense as you're in there kind of reworking
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.900]   and revamping the stores I believe you said it was about a 70 basis point hit last quarter
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:08.220]   do you quantify that this quarter or is there a way for you to kind of break that out or
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:17.180]   to whether overshadow that yeah I think we said last quarter Stephanie that we we walked
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:22.500]   everyone kind of through the the seven step process and talked about how we were retooling
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:28.940]   it to take take a lot of that work or almost all that work off of the store team so we were
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:33.980]   able to effectively do that in Q3 we didn't expect that we were going to have to talk about
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:40.700]   a headwind and we really don't have to in terms of from disruption related to the story image
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:46.100]   I think I think the the California stores on the west coast maybe saw a little bit more
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:50.900]   in disruption just because we did put a little bit more on them based on their proximity you
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:56.940]   know lack of proximity to our our core resources that are doing the reimage but for the 74 comp
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:04.420]   stores those were largely I would say undisrupted great and then just as a follow-up when we
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.060]   look at the tire category in general what are you staying from this over and inflationary
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:14.940]   environment I know it was inflationary earlier this year kind of reviewing how you saw during
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:22.780]   the quarter and your expectations going forward as well yes Stephanie when you look at go back
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:30.100]   Q2 one of the things we commented on was just we saw some inflationary pricing on also the
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:37.380]   top end of the product category with more premium brands and the first part of the second quarter
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:43.260]   we didn't see a lot of movement on the low-end brands if you will opening price point brand
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:48.820]   we saw that change exiting Q2 and into Q3 and I think as you saw and we made the comments
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:56.900]   in our fair remarks we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across all all price
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:04.660]   points relative to that point in Q3 I think our expectation for Q4 is pretty stable environment
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:12.940]   around pricing we don't expect you know meaningful material changes in the next quarter you know
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:18.740]   I think we're we're very focused now on now optimizing you know our internal pricing relative
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:25.720]   to the market leveraging you know the category management pricing tool we talked about great
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:30.380]   and then just lastly for me kind of more high level as you know we think through the strategy
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:36.340]   to expand just your tire services that some of those the mixed changes that your service
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:42.460]   stores does that just by nature put you a little bit more susceptible to changes in weather
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:47.460]   on an annual basis you know to your point you set on the call that you know it is the tire
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:53.660]   category that rear if it's a more mild weather or where you don't really see the the volume
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:57.380]   during that period so does this mean that you know in these conversations going forward
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:02.220]   weather could have a larger impact or similar to what we saw this year that may be in prior
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:07.980]   years so maybe your thoughts on that this high level would be great thanks so much yeah thanks
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:14.000]   Stephanie I think you know strategically I would I would start with this they are strategy
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.900]   in rows we like the business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that's focused
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:26.140]   on tires and full service I think you're not going to see us migrate to a tire only category
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:30.660]   as a broad sweeping strategy for all the reasons you just mentioned we like diversification
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:36.860]   in the services we like being very relevant on frequently purchased items like scheduled
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:44.140]   maintenance for cars and certainly brakes and other under car services I think as we increase
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:51.260]   our total business certainly we're going to pick up a little more exposure to tires as we convert
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:57.180]   more stores in the north I think to that however I think our broader company strategy is diversifier
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:02.980]   store footprint more into the south and out west and certainly in those regions of the
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:08.180]   country you don't see I think a level of volatility that comes with the tire of business like you
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:22.580]   would find in the northeast and midwestern markets great that's everything for me appreciate
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:29.020]   it thanks Stephanie thank you our next question is coming from Scott Stember of Steel King
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:36.500]   please go ahead good morning and thanks for taking my questions where it's got a follow
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:42.180]   up on that last question about you know high level about weather and I know the goal here
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:46.000]   was with all this heavy lifting that you're doing right now on all these new processes
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.820]   get to the point where I guess we're not talking about whether having worked whether does not
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:57.820]   really deliver all the quarter from a comp perspective could you talk about I mean just broadly speaking
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:03.940]   about how long do you think that will take for us to get to that point where weather could
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:08.780]   be a headwind but it's not going to be a determinant whether your positive negative from a comp
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:16.740]   standpoint I think given our our exposure to the northeast as long as our store concentration
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:23.140]   is heavy in the Midwest and northeast inherent in that as we pick up exposure I think to
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:28.580]   weather obviously don't like to talk about sky as you said our strategy is diversify the
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:33.900]   footprint keep continuing to grow down south and that's reflected by our acquisitions we
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:40.540]   continue to build out Florida and have expanded now into Louisiana and Tennessee and certainly
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:46.540]   out west is reflected of that desire to create more or less ball volatility in our business
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:54.740]   due to the store for footprint now in our core store markets we don't accept internally the
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:52:01.660]   volatility in our business and and we're invested in technology as we talked about to help us
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:07.660]   better execute in stores through better trained people executing better on the phones with
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:13.100]   our phone upgrade that we're currently doing all the initiatives under Monroe forward are
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:18.900]   designed to drive performance in our stores regardless of weather I think will help neutralize
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:24.700]   some of the impact that we see from from the volatility that comes with snow and colder
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:33.100]   temperatures and just the last question you know I know that there are certain things
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:39.060]   like tires that will see an immediate impact from from weather but more on the side of
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:46.240]   the mechanical parts typically you could see an impact from you know warmer weather or colder
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:52.460]   weather you know a few quarters down the road is there a chance that we could see an extended
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.900]   negative impact on the mechanical part side in the next couple of quarters and that's
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:01.500]   all I have thanks yeah thanks guys I think as we commented in the quarter our breaks were
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:07.300]   down three percent in the quarter certainly we're up against strong comp from last year
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:13.100]   but also I would say we do sell a fair share of brake services through tires because if
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:17.980]   you take the consumers tires off their vehicle gives you the chance to inspect their wheels
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:23.940]   their brakes now we do see some nice demand for conversion from tires into brakes as
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:31.420]   a result of that as it relates to the downstream effect I think certainly more harsh winners
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:38.820]   have a tendency to tear up things on the vehicles however I will say one benefit of having a
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:45.460]   more mild winner is usually that leads to spring coming sooner it opens up a window I think
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:52.900]   for an extended spring selling season so we felt feel like we're well positioned I think
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:57.260]   coming out of the winter given our strength and how we perform historically in the service
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:02.980]   categories and given the the emphasis that we placed on good better best packages in store
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:10.340]   I think we feel confident that we'll be well positioned going into the spring selling season
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:16.260]   got it that's all I have thanks thanks guys thank you at this time I would like to turn
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:22.500]   the floor back over to management for closing comments thank you for joining us today and
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.340]   for your continued interest and support in Monroe we believe we're well positioned to
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:30.940]   execute our strategy and drive long-term value for our shareholders we look forward updating
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:37.900]   you on our progress next quarter have a great day ladies and gentlemen thank you for your
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:42.340]   participation this concludes today's event you may disconnect your lines at this time
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.380]   and have a wonderful day

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.660]   Good morning and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 General Electric Company Earnings Conference
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.660]   Call.
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.220]   My name is Brandon and I'll be your operator for today.
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.400]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.120]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session during which you can dial star one
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.800]   if you have a question.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.320]   Please note this conference is being recorded and I will now turn it over to Steve Winiker,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.760]   Vice President of Investor Communications, you may begin, sir.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   Thanks Brandon.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.760]   Good morning and welcome to GE's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.400]   I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO Larry Kulp and CFO Carolina Dadekapa.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.880]   Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880]   on our website.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.080]   Note that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and are based on our best
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.400]   view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.400]   As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change if the world
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.400]   changes.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.240]   With that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.480]   Steve, thanks.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.240]   Good morning everyone.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.120]   We hope you and your families are healthy and safe.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.680]   Our thoughts are with all of those affected by this global pandemic.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.560]   We recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.360]   On behalf of GE, I want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical community,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.400]   many of whom were privileged to call our customers, working tirelessly to protect all of us.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.400]   Thank you.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.000]   When we last spoke during our outlet call in March, we were encouraged by the continued
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.720]   strength and aviation and healthcare and the progress made in power and renewables.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.560]   In the eight-week sense, the world has fundamentally changed.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.440]   As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly, hitting hard and hitting fast.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.600]   While this is an earnings call, our goal today is to provide you with the most current and
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.280]   relevant information we have and, as always, to be as open and transparent as we possibly
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   can.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.840]   So forgive us if we've run a little long today.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   The COVID-19 dynamics at GE, like the economy at large, are fluid and still evolving, but
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.760]   clearly challenging in the near term.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.200]   With that, I'll start with our response to COVID-19.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.600]   Carolina, who is joining our earnings call for the first time, will cover the financials
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.440]   and I'll wrap with a more in-depth view of our current operations.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.840]   Moving to slide two, during this unprecedented time, we're focused on three areas.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.360]   First, the health and safety of our employees and our communities.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.760]   We established a COVID-19 task force that is working to ensure we're doing everything
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.080]   in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with the various government directives
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.380]   and medical advisories in real time.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.640]   To that end, we've encouraged those employees who are not directly performing customer-facing
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.760]   essential jobs to work from home wherever possible.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.440]   But given the mission critical work we do at GE, not everyone can stay home.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.680]   I'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.280]   unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers, supporting essential services
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.520]   like hospitals, power generation, airlines and national defense.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.600]   We're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.280]   This includes temperature screenings, face coverings and gloves as necessary and physical distancing,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.920]   all keeping with national, state and local guidelines.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.720]   I'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   We recently established an employee relief fund and more than 75 senior leaders across
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.920]   GE have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.280]   Our second priority is continuing to serve our customers.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.040]   In healthcare we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.680]   and treat COVID-19 patients, including respiratory CT monitoring solutions X-ray anesthesia and
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.120]   point of care ultrasound product lines.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.360]   Already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the end of June.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.200]   Healthcare's digital and AI solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.960]   at once and automate wrote tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.840]   on life saving work.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.920]   Across all of our businesses we're in constant communication with employees, customers, suppliers
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.560]   and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.600]   Our third priority is preserving our strength.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.520]   First and foremost sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.480]   a key focus.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   With the recent closing of the biopharma transaction we received $20 billion of net proceeds.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.040]   This provides GE with optionality to protect our company and remain flexible and importantly
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.960]   we retain the $17 billion leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem striving
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.160]   for precision health.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.480]   Preserving our strength in a time like this also requires a different operating model.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:29.120]   Here I draw on my experience as a CEO managing through 9/11 and the global financial crisis.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:37.000]   There are three steps in this model embrace reality, redefine winning and execute the plan.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.240]   Easy to say hard to do.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.120]   Starting with embrace reality this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.760]   and remains uncertain.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.520]   For us it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.600]   be for a while.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.040]   We wish it were otherwise but that's not our reality.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.040]   Next redefine winning.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.720]   We came into 2020 with a plan that defined winning is profitable growth, margin expansion
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.680]   and cash generation.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.320]   Now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.240]   Let me share some ways we're doing this.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.320]   While safety has always been a top priority for GE COVID-19 has reshaped our safety agenda.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.780]   In terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and decriminal margins
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.960]   within the second half are key focus areas and in health care we clearly didn't come into
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.080]   the year expecting to increase our ventilator production in four fold but we will.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.120]   And finally execute the plan.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.900]   We're moving with speed, discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure targeting more
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.760]   than $2 billion of cost actions and more than $3 billion of cash actions and this is where
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.520]   lean is particularly relevant from daily management through traditional Kanban systems which help
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.560]   reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools were rolling out across GE.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.580]   Let me share a recent example from gas power in our Greenville facility the team used lean
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.880]   to cut the distance that a single part travels during production from three miles, yes three
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:19.880]   miles to a mere 165 feet flashing the time it took to make that part by 42 percent.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.760]   These are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:30.060]   environment so that's our approach here we're facing the pandemic head on while continuing
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.840]   to execute our long-term strategy for GE moving to slide three you'll find a snapshot of our
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.460]   first quarter results and Carolina will take you through this in detail but first a few
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:47.880]   top-line thoughts as I noted we entered the year with momentum however as COVID-19 continued
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.720]   to spread globally and I'm not going to sugarcoat this we got hit hard and some of our highest
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.880]   margin parts of our best-performing businesses this is especially true at aviation services
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:05.200]   where COVID-19 caused a rapid decline in commercial aviation demand and even essential travel
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.440]   became difficult in the second half of March a similar situation also transpired at power
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.080]   services where travel restrictions caused by COVID-19 impacted our field personnel and
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.480]   across all of our businesses we started to see some project fulfillment and execution
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.200]   issues at the same time health care performed well due to urgent demand for our products
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.860]   used in the fight against COVID-19 taking a step back about 80 percent of our roughly
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:41.520]   $400 billion backlog is in services which have a long time horizon and while services have
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.320]   been hurt in the near term those capabilities remain one of our greatest strengths they keep
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.760]   us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships especially through periods of
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.960]   volatility so in the spirit of embracing reality let me frame for you what we're seeing right
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.840]   now at a high level and then I'll do a deeper dive after Carolina reviews the first quarter
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.520]   in aviation in a gcast airlines are conserving cash not flying the planes they have limiting
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.360]   maintenance there spend where they can and all the while deferring orders in many places
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.800]   no one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume but the reality
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:27.280]   is likely it's not soon so we're redefining winning from margin expansion in 2020 to improving
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.600]   our decriminal margins this year which requires we aggressively adjust our cost structure that's
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.960]   what winning looks like for aviation and they're moving forward with a comprehensive plan to
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:44.400]   be clear we'll get back to targeting those 20% operating margins post pandemic in health
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.820]   care we've been on the front lines combating cobit 19 since the early days in Wuhan this
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:57.040]   is fundamental to our mission while we've seen demand surge for certain products other products
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.960]   including those in our high margin pharmaceutical diagnostics business have been negatively
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:08.640]   impacted as multiple procedures are deferred health care is likely to rebound faster than
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:15.480]   aviation but we're still fast tracking additional cost out actions targeting an incremental
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:22.140]   700 million dollars since Karen and the team spoke with you in December in power and renewable
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:27.920]   energy the impact of cobit 19 has been more limited to date specifically at power we're
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.660]   experiencing outage delays and restrictions in field service travel and we're monitoring
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:38.600]   new unit orders and services to offset this we're further right sizing the cost structure
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:47.000]   and in power we already reduced headcount by 700 in the first quarter now clearly across
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.320]   GE there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point including the full
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:58.840]   duration magnitude and pace of recovery across our end markets operations and supply chains
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   we're also monitoring how the resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.360]   and our runoff insurance business so let me tell you what we do know the second quarter
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.240]   will be the first full quarter with pressure from cobit 19 and we expect that our financial
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:22.080]   results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year the bottom line is
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.720]   we have some challenging times ahead but this too shall pass I'm confident the underlying
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.680]   reset we took over the last 18 months to focus GE's portfolio and instill a greater focus
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:42.120]   on customers and lead give us a running start for what we face today moreover I've seen our
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.840]   response to cobit 19 signs of how we're moving faster to change GE for the good more to mean
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.960]   work to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges in aviation travel restrictions
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.400]   spring on the use of remote digital technology to complete fieldwork and renewables and more
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:05.680]   capital discipline across the board with new leaders assimilating faster and with real impact
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:12.120]   healthcare comes to mind so all of this in combination with the planned actions we'll discuss later
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.520]   are accelerating our transformation of GE with that I'll turn it over to Carolina but before
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.600]   I do let me say how pleased I am behalf are on board in two short months it's clear we
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:29.240]   share the same perspectives of embracing reality and operational bias reaction and executing
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.360]   of speed.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.080]   Thank you Larry I'm proud to join my first call as CEO of GE and help leave this company
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:46.320]   and team forward as you noted we're operating in unprecedented times I'll be focused on
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.400]   first keeping our financial position strong and safe with the keen eye on leverage and liquidity
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.480]   as well as cash flow and capital discipline while GE's actions over the last couple of
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.760]   years have put us on stronger footing ahead of this situation we will do more.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.860]   Second working with our businesses to take the right action not only to help mitigate the
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:14.760]   impact of COVID-19 but to serve customers better operate smarter and more efficiently and integrate
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.360]   lean more holistically while Larry and I are focused on the near term we're also managing
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:26.040]   for the long term we're working together to reduce complexity at GE build a lean culture
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.640]   that delivers sustainable earning and cash flow generation.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:35.440]   Today my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:42.360]   help you see what I see across the businesses with that let's turn to slide four.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.480]   This was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated taking
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:54.800]   it from the top first quarter orders were down 3% organically or down 4x biopharma growth
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.200]   in power and health care was upset by double digit decline in aviation and renewables both
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:06.720]   equipment and service orders were down low single digits I'll cover this by business shortly.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:13.040]   Industrial revenue was down 5% organically or down 6x biopharma with equipment revenue flat
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.240]   and services down 9% both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:26.960]   due to COVID-19 adjusted industrial profit margins were down 450 basis points organically
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:32.680]   most of the dilution came from aviation and renewables with the aviation impact mostly driven by COVID-19
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:43.120]   let's discuss the EPS work starting at continuing EPS of 72 cents there was a 75 cents gain primarily
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:49.400]   related to the 11.5 billion off the tax gain from the biopharma sale which also included one cent
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:56.760]   of tax benefit in geo capital this was partially upset by a 4.6 billion off the tax loss on our
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:03.360]   remaining Baker huge stake which we measure at fair value edge quarter on restructuring and other
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.200]   items we incurred two cents of charges this is principally related to the reduction of
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:14.920]   aviation's u.s. workforce lastly non-operating pension and other benefit plans were six cents
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:22.480]   head within the quarter excluding these items adjusted EPS was five cents as described earlier
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.920]   our earnings performance was materially impacted by COVID-19 and other market dynamics this was
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:33.560]   primarily in aviation and G capital with negative marks and impairments in both vehicles and insurance
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:39.800]   as well as higher credit costs we estimate the first quarter industrial operating profit impact
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:47.960]   from COVID-19 roughly 700 million drivers included lower aftermarket sales project delays and supply
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:54.520]   chain constraints this impact is higher than the anticipated at the March outlet call reflecting
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.960]   the rapid global progression of the pandemic while our prior forecast largely reflected the
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:06.080]   slowdown in China our focus on addressing this pandemic is global we're targeting more than
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.280]   two billion of cost out this year but this may not affect the full impact we're rapidly addressing
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:18.240]   both cost and cash and making our businesses more agile and customer focused over time I can
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.240]   tell you from my experience that if this program feels momentum and the company leaders begin to
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:29.320]   see how powerful results can be they tend to extend beyond their stated goals just what
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:36.120]   I am saying so far I'm encouraged that we can have some of that same experience at you moving
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:42.640]   to cash as many of you know the first quarter is typically low for our free cash flow this year
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:48.520]   we're impacted by our usual sustainability but also COVID-19 especially in aviation industrial
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:55.040]   free cash flow was a use of 2.2 billion one billion worse than prior year but notably excluding
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:01.480]   aviation each industrial business improved free cash flow versus last year turning to the key
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:08.880]   drivers in the quarter starting with net earnings if you exclude the biopharm again and the market
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.320]   on our baking huge investment income depreciation and amortization total 700 million that's
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:22.720]   down 900 million versus prior year next working capital negative 2.6 billion the significant
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:29.120]   use of cash down 1.1 billion let me take it through the main factors first we had a net
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:35.840]   inflow in account receivable driven by a seasonally lower volume in gas power and renewables second
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.240]   we had an outflow in account stable driven by a lower volume in aviation and higher disbursements
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:48.760]   related to prior year material bias in renewables third we increase inventory to support unexpected
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:55.180]   second and third quarter volume ramp in onshore wind and shop output declined in aviation
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:00.280]   forth progress collections they were a use of cash as new orders and milestone payments
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:06.720]   were more than affect by burn down of prior progress payments in power and renewables lastly
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:13.240]   we also spent about 600 million in gross capital we don't track now to reduce 25 percent of our
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:19.240]   cap expand this year for cash flow in total we estimate the first quarter impact from covid
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:26.760]   19 of around 1 billion the majority of which was felt in aviation as we look forward we
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.720]   expect continued free cash flow pressure we're targeting more than 3 billion in cash action
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.200]   however over time we know that each business can be a better cash generating as we improve
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:45.640]   execution moving to slide six we continue to strengthen our balance sheet the largest
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:51.180]   milestone in the quarter was closing by a farmer the 20 billion opposite we ended the quarter
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:59.880]   with 33.8 billion of industry cash up approximately 16 billion sequentially T capital ended with
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:05.440]   13.5 billion of cash down approximately 5.3 billion sequentially driven by contractual
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:13.400]   majority we continue to hold a liquidity balance covering 12 months of G debt maturity we recently
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:21.040]   taking actions to enhance and extend our liquidity and pay down debt on April 17 GE entered into
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:27.080]   a three year 15 billion syndicated revolving credit facility this was a planned refinancing
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:33.160]   of these prior 20 billion syndicated revolver credit facility including bilateral agreements
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:39.440]   we expect to have in the range of 20 billion in total credit line actions going forward following
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.880]   the sale of biopharma we also improved our liquidity profile in April we reduced our near
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:50.760]   term debt maturity by issuing 6 billion in GE debt in April and subsequently tendering
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:56.440]   for 4.2 billion of debt we plan to use the remaining 1.8 billion opposite to further debt
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.480]   reduction and the combination of transaction will therefore be leveraged neutral following
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   this GE industrial has noted maturity in 2021 1.9 billion of maturity in 2022 and 9 hundred
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:18.320]   million in 2023 at GE industrial we reduced debt by approximately 7 billion we reduced commercial
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:24.040]   paper used by 1.1 billion in the quarter and we paid 6 billion of the intercompany loan
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:30.880]   from GE to GE capital in April using proceeds from biopharma at the capital we reduced
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:37.560]   debt by 4 billion so we reduced external debt by 10 billion year today including 4.7 billion
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:45.480]   of maturity in the quarter and an additional 5.4 billion of 2020 maturity tendered in April
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:51.560]   offset by GE's 6 billion repayment from the intercompany loan our financial policy goals
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:21:01.000]   remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than 2.5 times net debt to ABDA at GE industrial
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.240]   and less than 4 times debt to equity at GE capital accrediting in the single A range and reinstating
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   a dividend in line with peers over time we remain committed to achieving our leverage targets
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.080]   but we now expect to achieve those targets over a longer period than previously enough
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:28.440]   due to the impact of COVID-19 next on slide 7 we'll discuss the industrial segments results
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.880]   starting with aviation as we've noted our first quarter results were materially impacted
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.760]   orders were down 13 percent organically with both equipment and service orders bound equipment
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:45.260]   orders were down 27 percent primarily driven by commercial engines business due to the max
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:52.440]   grounding and the COVID impact services orders were down 4 percent primarily driven by commercial
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.640]   services partially offset by military which one new fighter and helicopter service orders
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.840]   from the US DOD service orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders which
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:11.480]   were up 60 percent year over year backlog of 273 billion was flat sequentially and up 22
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.720]   percent versus prior year primarily driven by long-term service agreement this included
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:25.060]   roughly 201 b unit order translations in the quarter revenue was down 11 percent organically
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:31.600]   equipment revenue was down 17 percent we shipped 472 commercial install and spare engine units
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:41.880]   this quarter down 37 versus prior year sales of 272 deep 1a and 1b units were down 152 and
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:49.320]   cfm 56 units were down 98 units service revenue was down 8 percent due to commercial services
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:55.920]   down 11 percent this was driven by lower spare parts shipments and lower shop visits from
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:02.880]   the impact of COVID-19 total military revenue was down 7 percent with 146 engine units shipments
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.920]   down 9 percent and this was driven by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound material
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:16.360]   is partly assessed by the advanced programs growth operating profit was down 39 percent organically
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.080]   primarily on lower volume and negative mixed pressure in commercial services from the impact
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:29.880]   of COVID-19 and lower spare engine units segment margin contracted 650 basis points organically
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.060]   this was primarily due to COVID-19 impacting our commercial businesses in both engines
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:43.160]   and services they continued 737 max grounding the non repeat of prior year favorable contract
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.160]   adjustment and the first full quarter of revenue from our derivative business now that we have
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:55.240]   deconsole dated bake a fuse add a bit more color COVID-19 represents just over half of
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.840]   the year-over-year margin difference 737 max timing considering install and spare engine
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:08.160]   volume and supply chain except cost represent additional 20 percent of the volume moving
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.200]   to health care which performed well orders were up 9 percent organically equipment orders
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.720]   were up 14 percent and services were up one health care orders excluding via farmer were
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:25.560]   up 6 percent driven by a surge demand related to COVID-19 this was partially offset by delays
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:32.060]   in procurement and lower demand of products less related to COVID-19 examples like MR and intervention
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:37.000]   in health care systems as well as contrast media and nuclear tracers in pharmaceutical
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:45.200]   diagnostics life sciences orders were up 10 percent backlog was 17.4 billion down 6 percent
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.760]   sequentially and down 3 versus prior year due to the sale of by Rana excluding biopharma
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:57.480]   backlog was up 1 percent sequentially and 4 versus prior year revenue was up 2 percent organically
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:03.560]   and 1 percent excluding biopharma health care systems revenue was up 2 percent with services
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:11.040]   and 3 percent with equipment flat life sciences was up 4 percent operating profit was up 10
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.900]   percent organically segment margin expanded 140 basis points organically or 30 basis
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:22.760]   points excluding biopharma this was driven by volume and cost productivity of fed by price
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:30.040]   and logistics pressures from COVID-19 next on power we had mixed results with equipment
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:37.320]   top line strength of Fed by challenges in services orders were up 14 percent organically gas power
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:44.000]   orders were up 8 percent with equipment orders up 37 percent largely due to one turnkey order
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.320]   we booked 2.2 gigawatt of orders for 9 gas turbines gas power service orders were down 3 percent
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.280]   with contractual services down and transactional upgrades roughly flat power portfolio orders
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:04.100]   were up 27 percent with strong equipment services orders in spoon and power conversion backlock
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:10.120]   close at 85 billion flat sequentially and down 1 percent versus prior year gas backlog was
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:18.000]   71 billion flat sequentially revenue was down 12 percent organically largely driven by services
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.280]   in gas power revenue was down 12 percent gas power equipment revenue was up 4 percent organically
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:31.000]   on higher H turbine mix we shipped 9 gas turbines versus sorry we shipped 7 gas turbines versus
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.440]   9 gas turbines in the first quarter of 19 we helped our customers achieve commercial operations
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:44.760]   on over 32 units translating almost 4.7 gigawatts of new power added to the grid that power services
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:50.640]   revenue was down 19 percent organically as outages this and transactional sales pushed
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:56.500]   out of the quarter due to cobit 19 and we had lower revenue on higher margin upgrades despite
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.920]   this services would still have been down in the quarter this was driven by supply-based constraints
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:09.040]   on hot gas part parts and outage costs overall pressuring our CSA margin rate power portfolio
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.840]   revenue was down 12 percent this was driven by lower volumes across the sub segments in
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   still we had lower services back low convertibility in nuclear the decline was driven by outage
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.800]   timing and in power conversion we refined our sales perimeter focus on higher margin market
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:34.320]   segments operating profit was down 239 million and segment margin contracted 570 basis points
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:40.280]   organically while gas power fixed costs were down 9 percent sequentially and 16 versus
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:45.400]   prior year this was more than upset by lower service volume and additional cost from cobit
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:53.320]   19 disruption next renewables continue revenue growth was more than upset by fulfillment
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:28:00.720]   and execution issues impacting profitability orders were down 11 percent organically equipment
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:07.040]   were down 11 as we cycle a stronger US PTC and services were down 23 percent a positive
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:14.200]   spot in the quarter with international orders which were up 11 percent backlog of 26 point
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:22.160]   5 billion on 4 percent sequentially but up 5 percent versus prior year revenue was up 28
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:28.520]   percent organically this was mainly driven by onshore wind up 60 percent onshore equipment
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:34.980]   revenue was up 81 percent with the new unit turbine delivers of 731 more than double prior
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:42.420]   year and we power kid delivers of 219 up 40 percent onshore services revenue excluding
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:49.240]   the power kids was up 15 percent onshore order pricing index continues to stabilize at 1
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:55.600]   percent in line with missing trend grid revenue was down 8 percent mostly due to site closures
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:03.600]   and delayed milestones driven by cobit 19 operating loss was down 115 million these were driven
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.640]   by the supply chain disruptions due to cobit 19 fulfillment delays and the non recurrence
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.360]   of a non cash gain from an offshore wind contract termination in the prior year this was partially
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:21.600]   upset by higher onshore wind volume segment margin contracted 210 basis points mainly
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.840]   driven by the same items mentioned above and the range of execution issues were fixing
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:36.440]   at grid and hydro moving to slide 8 starting with capital in the quarter adjusted continue
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:43.040]   operations generated a net loss of 118 million this exclude the impact of the capital loss
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:49.800]   tax benefit utilized against biopharm again results in 88 million of earnings compared to prior
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:55.840]   year which exclude exclude the US tax reform benefit continuing net earnings was unfavorable
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:03.440]   by 154 million this was due to negative marks and impairments of GCAP and insurance lower gain
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.320]   and lower earnings from a smaller asset base this was partially upset by lower excess interest
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:15.760]   cost and SG needs the end of the quarter with 101 billion assets excluding liquidity this
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.880]   was down 1 billion sequentially primary driven by GCAP due to asset sales depreciation and
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:27.560]   collection partially upset by new volume insurance assets were flat sequentially as a decrease
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:33.840]   in unrealized gains driven primarily by higher market rates was upset by the annual insurance
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.560]   the capital contribution supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continue
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:48.180]   to migrate to MUFG as noted earlier capital ended the quarter with 13.5 billion of liquidity
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:55.000]   and also ended with 54.5 billion of debt which was down 4.5 billion sequentially driven by debt
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.480]   maturity this continued operations generated a net loss of 164 million which was unfavorable
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:08.600]   versus prior year by 200 million we still plan to provide the required support to GE capital
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:15.680]   in line with insurance tax funding next just like our businesses corporate needs to adjust
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.880]   our new reality and we are continuing to take additional structural actions to rationalise
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:27.040]   cost and reduce the size at corporate looking at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:33.680]   374 million 8% higher but that's primarily due to higher intercompany profit elimination
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.920]   which will partially offset by better digital performance from continuing cost reduction
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:45.120]   actions functions and operations were 25% lower primarily driven by GE digital improvements
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.200]   you can see from digital performance that the focus cost reduction programs are getting
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:56.720]   traction we continue to right side our functional cost across GE and push more accountability
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:02.920]   into the division Larry and I are conducting cost and cash reviews of each of the businesses
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.880]   with fresh eyes in the current environment so you can expect that there will be more
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:14.800]   to come stay tuned I have spent most of my career in leadership at lean decentralized
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.320]   companies fundamentally I believe companies outperform when they have a structure that
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.680]   empowers businesses to take the right action quickly this type of structure is critical
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:31.400]   to respond to situations like we have today with COVID-19 but also to be prepared to pivot
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:37.600]   to growth we're working toward this goal and there will be more to come with us back to
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:47.200]   you Larry carolina thank you there's no question
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:53.160]   that COVID-19 is putting real pressure on our businesses given that so much has changed
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.040]   and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure from COVID-19 I'd like to spend
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.880]   some time here discussing second quarter trending based on what we're seeing through the month
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:10.840]   of April so starting with aviation on slide nine of all of our industrial segments this
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.680]   business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely the rapid contraction of air
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.000]   travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial airlines suspend routes
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.400]   and ground large percentages of their fleets we'll cover commercial services and engines
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.880]   on the next two slides in detail but on the other end of the spectrum demand for our military
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:37.240]   business remains strong to that end we re re rebalance some of our capacity to meet this
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.600]   increased demand to offset some pressure in the commercial business we're taking several
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:49.080]   steps that while painful preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:55.560]   we've previously announced 500 to $1 billion in costs and cash actions and we've now increased
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:02.680]   this targeting more than $1 billion in cost actions and more than $2 billion in cash actions
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.040]   this will be achieved through different initiatives some of which have been completed others in
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:14.360]   flight as we speak these include a 10% reduction in aviation's total U.S. workforce and furloughs
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:22.560]   impacting 50% of its U.S. maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufacturing
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.920]   will continue to monitor and potentially extend as required we're also focused on reducing
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:36.760]   the discretionary and cap extend and optimizing working capital I know aviation's decremental
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.560]   margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors and Carolina touched on the main
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.080]   dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter while we expect our commercial revenues and
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.600]   profits will continue to be down in the second quarter our expectations are that the cost
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:56.640]   actions we're undertaking will improve decremental margins in the back half of the year while
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.000]   there are many uncertainties I expect that we will exit the year with a much lower decremental
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.800]   margin than what you saw in the first quarter so make no mistake thriving improvement here
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.640]   is our number one focus as we think about the full year we're tracking travel restrictions
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.480]   carrier and passenger behavior disease countermeasures and freight demand all of which will impact
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:24.720]   aircraft departures and revenue passenger kilometers while we're seeing an unprecedented decline
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.560]   in 2020 we're taking action and David and the team are working proactively with our customers
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:36.880]   to navigate through this crisis so spending a little more time on commercial services
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:42.640]   which represented 3.3 billion dollars of revenue in the first quarter let's go to slide 10 as
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.360]   you can see on the left side departures across the full industry was strong in the first quarter
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.640]   before rapidly declining in mid-March as we look at it this week focused on the GE and
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:36:00.040]   CFM fleet global departures are down approximately 75 percent roughly 60 percent of the CFM fleet
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.880]   is parked today in line with this we're also seeing significant headwinds and global shop
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:11.000]   visits which were down low double digits in the first quarter is airlines defer short term
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.240]   maintenance and we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better with some potential
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.960]   moderate and the latter half of the year depending on the variables just outlined based on what
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.880]   we're seeing through the month of April in the second quarter we're seeing shop visits
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:33.280]   down roughly 60 percent and CSA billings down roughly 50 percent additionally we expect
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:40.120]   the significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure our CSA margins
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:46.360]   that said when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time she is well positioned
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:52.960]   with the largest and youngest install base of all engine manufacturers additionally roughly
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:37:00.040]   62 percent of our GE CFM fleet has she has seen one shop visit or the last and this will generate
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:07.040]   demand upon recovery we have more narrow bodies that are 10 years or younger than it than the
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:12.280]   narrow body installed base of the rest of the industry and when we see a pickup and air travel
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:18.880]   demand we expect narrow bodies will recover most quickly overall it was a challenging quarter
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   and we're expecting additional pressure here in the second but our cost action will alleviate
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:30.680]   some of the pressure in the second half of 2020 moving to commercial engines which represented
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:37.040]   $1.5 billion of revenue the first quarter in light of COVID-19 air framers are producing
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:42.080]   at a lower rate based on what we're seeing through the month of April in the second quarter
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.320]   we see installed engines down roughly 45 percent and spare engines down roughly 60 percent
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:53.280]   year on year attributable to the delivery deferrals in addition to the already planned lower production
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:59.840]   rate on the 737 max in the near term we're right sizing production capacity and actively
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:05.840]   managing the supply base we have very strong relationships with the air framers and an attractive
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.640]   value proposition is evidenced by a multi-year backlog as you'll see on the right we have
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:17.760]   strong positions sole source on two of the biggest new engine entrants and a 65% win rate on the
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.000]   other while we acknowledge there's pressure on near term demand for new aircraft these
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.040]   stats demonstrate the customer see the value of GE technology we're taking the right actions
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:36.240]   to be well positioned for the post pandemic world moving to health care which consists
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:43.120]   of health care systems and PDX in the second quarter today we're seeing increased demand
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.600]   for vital medical equipment and the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 within health care
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.720]   systems now these product orders including ventilators have increased one and a half
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:58.820]   to two times versus pre pandemic levels but at the same time we're seeing reduced demand
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:04.680]   for other diagnostic products as certain procedures are deferred or canceled around the world to
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.960]   be clear these other diagnostics are still essential and often associated with saving
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:17.600]   lives in areas including oncology and cardiology but are currently deprioritized PDX is a similar
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:23.040]   story this is a high margin this is made about contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:28.360]   with procedures that are being deferred or canceled right now several HCS product lines
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:35.960]   and most of PDX is down as much as 50% versus pre pandemic levels while these dynamics vary
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:41.160]   by country there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies experience different stages
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:47.520]   of the virus taking China for example as hospitals come back online we're seeing a ramp
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:53.620]   in previously deferred procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables health
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:59.280]   care is accelerating its planned transformation to expand margins post biopharma by reducing
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:06.420]   headcount fixed costs discretionary spend and marketing spend prioritizing r&d deferring
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:12.840]   catbacks and optimizing working capital looking forward we're most focused on the following
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:18.120]   indicators for health care hospital admission and occupancy rates and increase in non covid
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:24.400]   19 procedures changes in hospital capex budgets government spending on health care broadly
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.560]   and development of covid 19 test treatments and vaccines based on our experience in China
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.120]   and the market in April we expect to be down in the second quarter with potential recovery
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:44.040]   afterwards covid 19 is highlighted the need to build and truly invest and scale a new digitized
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:50.240]   infrastructure and quickly we're committed to our investments in our digital Edison platform
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:56.000]   and solutions like mural virtual care solution which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.560]   ventilated patients simultaneously helping to expand their capacity while reducing their
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:08.200]   risk of exposure as our digital health care journey continues we're at the center of an
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:13.940]   ecosystem striving for precision health I'm very proud of the work our team is doing to
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:23.080]   combat covid 19 moving to power on slide night on slide 13 we'll talk to the current trending
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:29.300]   in the second quarter to date in dynamics of gas power and power portfolio starting with
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.680]   gas power equipment while we're monitoring and managing supply chain disruptions as of
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:41.000]   today we still see a path to 45 to 50 gas turbine deliveries this year but our orders profile
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.080]   and therefore cash down payments worth several hundred million dollars are likely weaker due
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:52.360]   to IPP pressures in the US and Mexico is we expect that deal financing will become harder
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:42:00.120]   through the year additionally with oil price pressure impacting Middle East and ssa investment
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:07.560]   including demand for new lng we are expecting a longer road to normalization ultimately
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:13.320]   we're sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin accretive backlog with
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:19.840]   disciplined execution in services approximately 20% of planned averages are shifting from the
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.920]   first half of this year due to covid 19 field labor constraints we're also seeing pressure
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:31.120]   on upgrades primarily in the Middle East where low oil prices are impacting customer budgets
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:36.600]   we are seeing GE gas turbine utilization in the US up mid single digits due to low gas
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:42.880]   prices in the ship from coal but utilization globally is down low double digits due to lower
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:49.920]   electricity demand within power portfolio our steam business is most impacted factory
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:55.120]   closures pressured our steam operations including one facility in Wuhan which was closed for
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:02.640]   approximately eight weeks in the first quarter today we're back up to more than 70% of capacity
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.320]   the global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in India driven by government
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:12.640]   restrictions overall we're seeing about 30% of outages shift from the first half of this
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:20.240]   year to the second half with another 10 to 15% pushing into next year our power businesses
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:25.000]   are taking several measures to offset these pressures in the first quarter we reduced
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.880]   head count by 700 notified approximately 1300 contractors implemented a hiring freeze and
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.240]   in line with the demand profile we are taking even further actions this will serve to reduce
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:45.880]   fixed costs in 2020 and drive benefits in 2021 looking forward we're tracking a number of
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:51.240]   items including timing of our gas turbine new order closure service outages and volume leak
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:56.680]   utilization is the energy mix and fuel prices are impacting each region differently supplier
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:03.960]   impacts and project execution billing milestones and customer collections we're targeting to
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:09.840]   have our accelerated cost-out measures drive organic margin expansion despite these demand
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:18.000]   changes moving to slide 14 on renewables there was a limited impact of COVID-19 in the first
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.600]   quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.760]   as we've said we think about renewables and three distinct operating pools starting with
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:34.080]   onshore wind while we continue to deliver at record levels in the Americas we are seeing
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:39.240]   supply and change disruption at our LM wind facilities and we're monitoring key commercial
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:46.000]   milestones such as permitting and financing which could potentially cause timing delays
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.800]   in offshore wind certification for our industry leading turbine the Holyad X remains on track
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:59.480]   we're also on plan to start delivering on our 80 unit 6 megawatt commitments to EDF after
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.200]   completion of this project in 2021 we expect to start shifting production to the Holyad
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:13.000]   X we're also monitoring financial closure of 2020 deals grid and hydro our two turnarounds
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.680]   are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half of our grid facilities now operating
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:23.480]   below full capacity and a grid automation we're also impacted by lower book to bill order
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:29.880]   conversion across all three of these pools we're increasing cost out and restructuring
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.720]   and we've identified several hundred million dollars of additional actions longer term
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:41.120]   a lower cost structure will benefit renewables relating to the global supply chain we're focused
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:46.160]   on the safe reopening of our plants globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:51.900]   load levels looking forward we're expecting a larger impact on COVID-19 in the second
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:57.360]   quarter and by business we're tracking 20 and 21 demand impact on progress collections
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.720]   and potential site delays and onshore wind the risk of financing delays associated with deals
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:13.080]   at offshore project site delays at grid and hydro and the backlog at grid on slide 15
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.680]   G capital or GCAS in insurance businesses are where we are feeling the largest impacts so
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:23.880]   I'll keep my comments focused there first GCAS is better positioned today than in previous
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:31.440]   downturns with better asset quality less customer concentration and more geographic diversity
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.960]   that said we're preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments as well as lease restructuring
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:43.000]   and we've had approximately 80% of our customers seek short term deferrals as you may have seen
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.880]   we agree with going on a rebalancing of our 737 match or the book second at insurance market
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:56.240]   and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment portfolio and reinvestment
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:03.400]   yields therefore we're deploying capital to capture market dislocation investment opportunities
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:09.080]   we're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year and similar
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:13.880]   to the industrial segment we're implementing incremental cost and cash actions looking forward
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:19.600]   we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales of GCAS and insurance our
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:27.400]   season teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period so to close
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:33.320]   our priorities are clear we rapidly mobilized our team and the face of COVID-19 with our
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:39.320]   top priority being the health and safety of our employees and overall the priorities we
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:46.560]   reviewed with you at the outlook call remain intact we're facing into our near-term realities
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:51.640]   while continuing to manage GE for the long term when the world is facing the worst pandemic
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:48:00.620]   in a century our team is rising to the challenge with humility transparency and focus we continue
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:06.720]   to deliver value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential goods supplying
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:13.040]   vital health care equipment and keeping the lights on and while there are many unknowns
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:20.640]   there will be another side planes will fly again health care will normalize and modernize
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:26.960]   and the world still needs more efficient resilient energy at the same time we're embracing this
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:33.200]   new reality we're redefining winning and we're executing our plan the cost and cash and actions
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   we've taken you through this morning are a major result these moves will ultimately allow
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:45.440]   us to accelerate our multi-year transformation to make GE a stronger member and more valuable
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:56.760]   company and I am confident that GE will emerge stronger with that Steve let's go to questions
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:01.760]   right before we open the line I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.440]   again and ask one question and a follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.560]   Brandon can you please open the line yes thank you sir we'll now begin the question and answer
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:17.440]   session if you have a question please press star 1 under telephone keypad if you'd like
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.640]   to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key if you're on a
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.480]   speakerphone please pick up your handset first before dialing once again if you have a question
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   please press star one under telephone keypad and from vertical research we have Jeff Sprague
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:40.160]   please go ahead thank you good morning everyone help everyone as well thanks for all the great
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:47.160]   detail morning Jeff good morning I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:53.220]   on how you know kind of view the kind of the asset quality of the you know the contractual
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:58.020]   service agreements and the like there's a lot of assets there obviously there's at least
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:05.920]   a temporary impairment of cash flows how does that test work have you done it yet and are
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:14.560]   are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should be thinking about Jeff
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:25.160]   I think if we look at the service backlog right broadly just under 325 billion for the
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:32.880]   company the vast majority of that 234 billion is in aviation I suspect that's that's where
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:41.740]   you're most focused we we go through those those backlog reviews and the CSA reviews
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:50.060]   on a regular basis what we've done here over the last call at the last seven eight weeks
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:58.760]   is really tighten and quicken the review process that we do with the the businesses both at
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:04.660]   aviation and a GCAS what we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest and if
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:13.640]   you will most most accurate information possible with respect to customer risk given given everything
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.400]   that's going on so we we do that on a regular basis we did that at the at the end of the
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:25.400]   first quarter in in closing much as we do every quarter clearly we've got a we've got
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:32.900]   a fluid situation and I think the the modest charges that we took the modest changes in
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:36.880]   the first quarter clearly are going to play out as we go through the course of the year
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:43.760]   we can't really scope that for you today if you look at the CSA book in aviation for example
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:51.920]   is we went through the the mechanics of the future billings the future costs related to
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.320]   those buildings based on the information at the time it was really just a hundred billion
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:03.080]   dollar adjustment non cash of course which is why you see a little bit of the earnings cash
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:11.280]   dynamic certainly as we go forward we're going to be updating those those adjustments and
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:18.280]   again we would expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines are doing with
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.920]   with their planes but I think it's important to keep in mind again these these are ten
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:29.600]   to fifteen year agreements as you know and those adjustments are take taken in the context
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:36.840]   of that particularly extended time period great thanks for that and just as a follow-up if
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:43.600]   I could I know you don't want to get real precise on guidance but you know you you are
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.680]   pointing us to a further decline in cash flow in Q2 which isn't surprising quite quite frankly
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:55.960]   but could you bracket that at all for us what we should expect for for Q2 and you know any
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:03.640]   high-level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint yeah Jeff I think
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:11.760]   that we we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and didn't want to take an attempt
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:18.480]   at framing formal guidance here today in light of all of this blue and all of it is still evolving
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:24.000]   here and I think that the tack we took was really to try to to share as much with you as
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:31.160]   we possibly could in terms of the April detail business by business and acknowledge that
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:36.400]   we're going to see a more challenging second quarter here given the full impact of COVID
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:41.760]   and the like but beyond that I think that's that's really where we are we know we've got
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:47.200]   to get to work on the cost and the cash actions that's why you see it's doubling that activity
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:54.480]   in aviation stepping it up elsewhere around the company so the two billion of cost the
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:02.080]   three billion of cash will clearly help us later on in the year is those those actions
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:09.280]   take take root but for today I think that's really what we're that's what we know and that's
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:17.240]   what we're comfortable sharing thanks best of luck Larry thanks from Morgan Stanley we
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:37.600]   had poker's whiskey please go ahead Josh your line is open Josh you might be there why don't
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:45.240]   we Brandon let's let's move on and come back to Josh sure next question we have from Bank
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:58.280]   of America we have Andrew open please go ahead yes good morning can you hear me yep thank
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:07.880]   you so much and good luck to everybody so run rate minus 60 percent in terms of shop visits
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:14.440]   50% on CSAs do you think you continue to trend at this level in the second quarter or is there
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:28.080]   more downside enter the I think you're referring to page nine in the slide deck yeah what we're
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:37.720]   seeing here yeah I think this is what we're what we're seeing right now right and given
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:43.320]   given what the carriers have said publicly what they're doing and we think these are these
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:50.760]   are good likely near-end run rates to share with you we're not trying to offer up a definitive
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:55.800]   view is to the next several quarters but this is this is what we're seeing right now in the
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:06.480]   second quarter for sure and my follow-up question on spare engine sales I think minus 60% have
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:12.920]   we lost these or will these come back when the situation normalizes maybe you can give us
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:18.440]   some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over the next couple of years
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:31.240]   thank you so much Andrew we were we were ramping spares with with both the the leaf one a and
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:39.200]   the leaf one be as the narrowbody market was taking off typical early in the life of an
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:49.560]   engine activity we're clearly seeing that soften not necessarily going to zero as preparations
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:56.040]   are being made for the return to service of the max right I don't think that that that
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.080]   opportunity is lost but I think like much of what we're seeing in aviation broadly it will
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:06.600]   be it will be pushed out for a few years and again I don't think we're taking a definitive
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:13.760]   view as to what year what quarter things get back to if you will a normalized 2019 level
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:22.920]   but we recognize the discussions out there about this being a multi-year recovery gradual
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:30.680]   slow think we're embracing that reality and that applies really across the portfolio both
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:37.400]   on the oe side as well as the aftermarket spares included thank you very much for all the detail
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:49.160]   and stay safe thank you for your research we have Scott Davis please go ahead hey good morning
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:58.040]   guys and welcome Carolina thank you Larry any good morning Larry any any way to think about
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:04.560]   the cost actions it relates to kind of structural versus more kind of pandemic short term related
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:14.560]   sure well I would I would say Scott as you well know that when we're in a when we're
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:21.840]   in a mode like this you're you're moving as quickly as you possibly can almost anywhere
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:27.520]   that you can so if you look at what we've announced at aviation the doubling of those activities
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:36.800]   today the broadening across the company if you look at the the tally today there is a decidedly
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:43.640]   short term bias there that Carolina and I are going to be working with the CEO's over
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:51.560]   the coming weeks to transition to a more permanent action right if you look at what we did in aviation
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:58.400]   for example example in terms of the temporary lack of works that was a way to quickly adjust
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   our cost structure in that business on a variable basis to these shockingly fast changes in demand
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:13.880]   you might categorize that as temporary we need to work through the changes on a more permanent
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:18.720]   basis that are required and in light of the the length of the recovery that we're looking
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:24.520]   at so we have confidence in these in these numbers that we're sharing today the two billion
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:30.920]   of costs the three billion of cash there's a bit of a tactical bias today just given how
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:37.760]   fresh this is but we will be leaning in toward making more of them permanent recognize note
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:43.760]   the end of the day there will be a bit of a mix be it be it head count related discretionary
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:49.480]   spend on the cost side in addition to some of the working capital and certainly the cap
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:58.040]   X reduction the Carolina reference the 25 percent reduction year on year so a lot going on and
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:06.080]   by no means is this these headlines today the the end it's very much at working in progress
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:13.720]   okay that's helpful there and we think you know the 20 billion dollars kind of came to you pretty
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:19.520]   much about perfect timing but you know does that money just sit on the ballot does it have to sit
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.360]   on the balance sheet pretty much as is for the for the year can you or is it just such a big
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:29.680]   number you can start to parse some of it out to you know thinking in terms of whittling down some
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:43.160]   of the you know debt that you can you can manage well we it did come at a it at a good time
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:52.840]   there's there's no question that's why we put the emphasis in the biopharmists set up on certainty
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:58.280]   right we want to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the health care
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:06.280]   options Carolina anything you want to add relative to kind of managing liquidity versus leverage
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:14.400]   right here I think it's yeah I think it's important to acknowledge that the world is different now
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:20.160]   compared to before COVID and it's very important for us of course leverage is important but liquidity
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:27.280]   is very important and we end the quarter with 47 billion cash right and that's really to cover
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:34.520]   18 billion of the capital long-term debt maturity is now through 21 and actually after the April
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:41.920]   actions we are down to 13 billion of maturity for 2021 almost all of that team in capital and I
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.000]   would also say you know we expect to have around 20 billion in total credit lines going forward
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.680]   and that's really in line with our risk appetite we have the new 15 billion three year RCF that I
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:00.520]   mentioned and five billion dollars will be on 20 billion of credit lines I think we just say that
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.400]   you know we really intend to maintain a high level of cash I would say to maximize flexibility and
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:10.960]   that's why we're taking these actions also to be risk our balance sheet and basically prudently
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:18.880]   manage our liquidity in this very challenging external environmental time that makes sense and
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:28.760]   thank you and good luck to you guys thank you thanks Scott be well and let's try Josh pokers
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:35.120]   once again from Morgan Stanley please go ahead sir hi guys can you hear me this time yes yes
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.960]   clearly Josh good morning awesome and hope everyone is as well that go earlier comments
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:47.160]   what Larry can you just give us a sense and I know you guys have data going back eons and
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:54.440]   aviation how the impact of retirements and cannibalization you know kind of make more of
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:03:01.760]   a U shape versus you know what you know the air traffic may look like is is there a natural lag
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:07.920]   between when folks start flying again and when when shop visits can happen just as a function
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:17.800]   of kind of using up some of the runtime on otherwise idle assets well Josh you know certainly
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:23.720]   we have we have revisited the history the team is is well burst and what we've seen in
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:34.160]   years past not sure we've we've seen anything kind of on par with with this but there's there's
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.160]   no question that there there's going to be a bias on the part of some as some of these
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:48.440]   fleet reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft and that will factor into
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.320]   the to the aftermarket much like some of the dynamics around green time and how you're
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.900]   in the short term folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash in in in their
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:08.880]   business so I'm not sure that there is necessarily an exact model that captures what all the carriers
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.520]   and aggregate are going to do here a model that offers great precision I think we do
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:20.680]   know that this is that the combination these factors is going to create pressure for us
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:26.080]   force here in the short term I think what's most important for our business really is cycles
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:34.400]   much more so than rep revenue passenger miles and as we see schedules come back as we work
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:40.040]   our way through the pandemic that will that will put us back on I think better footing
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.200]   but here in the short term I think we're acknowledging that we're going to see shop visits and see
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:50.760]   if they billing take on some real pressure due to the downturn understood thanks all
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:59.980]   leave it there from JP Morgan we have Steve Tusa please go ahead Josh hey guys good morning
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:09.800]   hey Steve good morning in in in early March you guys had that slide that showed you know
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.200]   two to four billion and you know free cash flow guidance which is obviously off the table
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:19.400]   but you also talked about things growing and you know 21 and 22 and you know off that kind
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:25.260]   of three billion dollar base I think you know most research and numbers I saw we're kind
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:30.700]   of in that you know six billion dollar range of free cash flows to kind of growth off of
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:37.960]   that level are we still like is the are the out your numbers still at all legit or is
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:47.240]   that you know are you kind of withdrawing that long-term outlook as well Steve I think
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:54.860]   we have admittedly been focused on taking the right actions both the cost the cash the
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:06:00.720]   the balance sheet actions here in the short term in the face of this this unprecedented
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:06.960]   pandemic we've taken guidance off for the year we're not putting it back on today just
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:14.360]   given the given the undue uncertainty of it all right so I don't I don't think we're trying
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:20.920]   to get out any further than that I appreciate the question but I think for purposes of today
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:28.400]   we're really just trying to frame for folks what we're seeing but that said however long
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.260]   it takes us to work through this I think we feel very good about our ability to come out
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:43.240]   stronger and get back on a on a positive cash flow growth trajectory got got Carolina anything
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:50.160]   you would add to that well no I think it's important to to acknowledge that by taking
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:56.720]   out cost now and part of it being structural that gives us sort of as well as mitigating
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:03.800]   the decrement of that helps improving the incremental the outer years I mean that will depend on
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.600]   the recovery on the industries as well so so that's I would say what's impossible to speak
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:19.280]   right and and I guess how much on that structural offside see yeah good yeah yeah I'm just just
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.720]   one other point I think worth mentioning I'm I think what we're acknowledging here is that
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:28.640]   assistance played out in March and what we're seeing already in April right it really is
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:35.240]   hitting hitting us from mixed mixed perspective hard our highest margin businesses are really
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:43.000]   feeling it here I would think that on the on the recovery we would see we would see it
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.680]   swing the other way when we get back and come off a bottom we should have positive mix of
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:58.680]   fact it really across across the board particularly in aviation and healthcare your second question
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:05.740]   Steve which relative to the cost actions and how much permanent how much not permanent yeah
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:09.680]   I know I guess how much is that going to cost you I mean like you know to come up with two
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.560]   to three billion dollars of cost in cash you know you've done you cut your restructuring
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:19.680]   last year pretty significantly needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter I mean
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.440]   most companies kind of one for one what how much is this stuff going to cost you this
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:36.080]   year on a cash basis yeah I think what we have said previously we were going to be down
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.880]   off of last year from a from an expense and from a cash perspective I think we're we're
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:47.520]   probably going to end up more or less in line right keep in mind that some of the cost actions
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:55.880]   like furloughs don't carry restructuring charge with that right because they aren't permanent
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.780]   so part of what we're trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary cost but all the
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:05.920]   while if we can we can make more structural moves we want to make sure we've got room to
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:11.120]   do that but I'd say right now assume that it be relatively flat year on year but it's
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:19.200]   Carolina indicated in her remarks we want to try to do more if we can great alright thanks
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:28.260]   a lot best of luck guys thanks yes we have Marcus better bear please go ahead hi good
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:35.160]   morning Larry Caroline Steve let me maybe follow up on the on the market good morning hey good
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:43.800]   morning within the year so in your 10 Q you reference the number of 48% RPK reduction
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:49.800]   is and I know obviously a flight hours in RPKs are two different stories but it's not sort
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:56.480]   of a kind of scenario that you're flying through internally and I'm just trying to get a sense
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:02.320]   what that would mean if we look at our sort of like 19 aviation cash as a baseline sort
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.620]   of like where you know on that type of scenario we could end up particularly you know looking
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:15.200]   at sort of what you've mentioned in your preparedness remarks that you have I think 62% of of engines
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.720]   build ahead of shop visit one which arguably are the engines that are on the narrow bodies
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.760]   coming back first because they're probably the youngest youngest in the fleet right just
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:35.720]   trying to get a sense of within the year how you're thinking about that well I think that
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:43.160]   given what we highlighted relative to the April experience and the near term projection
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:50.680]   of that there's no question that we're going to continue to see the pressure on on cash
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:58.360]   at aviation that we've seen here of late right now that will be our undoubtedly our biggest
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:09.420]   headwind no sure about you know the you know shop visit we heard sort of the numbers that
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:18.320]   you that you said but did you do sort of internal internal stress tests around where you could
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:25.480]   end up with that it's just something that you say it's too early to comment no no no there's
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:36.520]   there's plenty there's plenty of planning or again a an extended slowdown here we're embracing
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:43.640]   this reality to the fullest extent possible we are not expecting this to bounce back in
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:49.920]   the near term so we flag in the queue the iota numbers we also reference others you see it
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:55.480]   in our own departure data here in April right we're we're we're way down that has a direct
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:04.840]   feed in the shop visits CSA billing and the like so we're adapting to this new environment
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:14.680]   we're confident that it will recover so we're we're simply not trying to assume that the
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:20.720]   pressure abates anytime soon witness the the cost of the cash actions that we're taking
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:27.160]   sure okay not appreciate that and maybe as a follow up quickly on the capital side do
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:33.280]   you anticipate any change in the in the capital support therefore for insurance in particular
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:38.080]   you you reference that a little bit in the prepared remarks i think two billion is sort
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:48.240]   of the current number are you thinking about that at the moment on the parent support to
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:56.160]   capital on the insurance let's let's take a step back then so in 19 the capital had an
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:05.840]   infusion from 4 billion right and the estimate for for this year is 2 billion on insurance
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:14.000]   funding and those 2 billion you know that significantly lower than the before we estimated
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.120]   that the parent will need to support roughly in mind with this some variables are still open
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:25.320]   and that depends on G capital itself right to G capital earnings the lr2 the capital ending
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:31.160]   assets liquidity level but basically it's about 2 billion as it looks now and i would also
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:37.120]   say going forward which is a thing of all of us we do continue to to anticipate further
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:44.720]   funding and that would be against recombination of G capital itself with their assets liquidity
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:56.260]   and their future earnings and on top of that possible capital contributions from thank you
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:01.360]   from Cohen and company we have quite time kind of please go ahead yeah thank you good morning
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:10.480]   guys good morning question two questions morning so at aviation it sounds like you guys acknowledge
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:18.560]   that on the way up the spares business the aftermarket the 15 billion dollar commercial
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:26.160]   aftermarket business will lag ASM growth because of you know a younger fleet emerging you know
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:32.400]   a surge of use serviceable material in the like part outs and obviously lower spares provisioning
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:40.640]   as the only rates come down 30 to 50% I guess first question is when do you anticipate aviation
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:49.320]   free cash flow getting to break even is it even possible before calendar 22 in that in
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:58.440]   type of environment and then I have a follow up
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:07.840]   I'm not not sure we would buy into the premise per se right I mean we we are cycles business
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:16.600]   much more so than any other indicator and the cycles are going to have to come back before
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:23.480]   the passengers do is you indicate the age of the fleet will will help us over time there
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:31.560]   could be some short term headwinds but we'll we'll we'll see how that plays out I think
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:40.560]   what we're acknowledging here that we've been hit from a free cash perspective in our our
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:49.720]   biggest and best cash generator at aviation but we're really not getting into much more
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:57.200]   in terms of the the pre cash forecast on a multi-year basis it's just too soon there's
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:04.120]   just too many moving pieces for us to be that forward leaning at this point we wish we could
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:11.480]   be it's just it's just not where we are and just to follow up you know obviously 2020 is
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:19.080]   a tough year we're gonna have some cash burn 2021 unclear but certainly doesn't seem like
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:25.380]   an aviation we're gonna have a strong recovery any so so as we emerge from this we're gonna
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:31.100]   have you know more leverage and I guess the question is you guys have made some asset
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:39.640]   sales to deleverage what else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:46.640]   better faster is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:17:01.120]   that's different than what you've done over the past year thank you well I would I'm not
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:18.200]   sure I would say that there's a lot that is no please Carolina yeah well I would just
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:27.280]   I would just say at a high level we are committed to our deleveraging target of less than two
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:32.000]   and a half times on the industrial side and I think you've seen us make a lot of progress
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:39.960]   year to date which I hope underscores the seriousness of that objective both on the GE side right
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:46.440]   like it's seven billion of debt reductions in the quarter and that capital hits up to
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.760]   10 on it on a year today basis given given some of the things we did in April clearly
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:59.160]   is going to take us a while longer here to hit those targets like I suspect most most
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.340]   companies but in terms of doing anything new or different I think we're going to continue
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:09.920]   to try to run these businesses as best we can be as disciplined as we can on the capital
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:16.480]   front be smart and thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations like like pension
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:22.280]   as you've seen us relative to the plan design and some of the settlement options so I'm not
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:28.760]   sure they're necessarily new plays per se but we'll continue to look at it every and every
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:33.020]   option available to continue to strengthen the company strengthen the balance sheet bring
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:40.640]   those leverage levels down in the face of COVID-19 Caroline I'm sorry I jumped in there
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:48.600]   I would just add to the leverage comment also the liquidity that at times like this you know
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:54.080]   you do look at the liquidity and I think it's important to say that we really want to maintain
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.560]   a high level of cash maximizer flexibility and you have seen the de-risking activities
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:10.920]   that we've made to sort of push out the debt in the further years so we keep optionality
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.920]   thank you yeah and I but I but I think to that it meant it's just important for us all to
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:20.800]   remember we ended the quarter with 47 billion of liquidity on the back of the biopharma
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.520]   action and some of the other things that we have done so we'll continue to be nimble and
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:36.440]   flexible mindful of our obligations and our reality okay from Barclays we have Julian
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:45.240]   Mitchell please go ahead hi good morning maybe just a question Julian good morning maybe
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:52.120]   just the first question around the working capital dynamics in the free cash flow at aviation
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:58.520]   like this you know there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:05.560]   down draft you get a working capital cash offset to an extent and then it reverses whenever
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:11.680]   the sales come back could you just update us on how you see the working capital cash impacts
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:18.360]   at G aviation sort of in the early stages now in this downturn what you would expect to
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:24.600]   happen to working capital when things recover and if there's any major difference on the
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:31.480]   cash dynamics of the power by the hour type service relative to the ad hoc spares activity
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:54.680]   at aviation yeah on with respect to working capital I think our our primary challenge
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:21:00.280]   is really inventory at aviation right we we came into this year knowing we were going
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:08.920]   to have to adjust to a different schedule with the max chasing the the step up at Airbus
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:16.160]   with the 320neo while dealing with a good bit of of past due on the commercial side both
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:23.800]   both OE and aftermarket while having pretty good military demands to contend with that
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:32.920]   all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from a casual perspective was an inventory
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:38.400]   at aviation in in the quarter so that that's where we're going to be most focused trying
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:44.160]   to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies adjust to the reduced production schedules
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:51.080]   the lower aftermarket requirements while continuing to take care of the military business it that
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:59.240]   that's a that's a complex supply chain undertaking but the team as you can imagine is keenly
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:04.600]   focused on using some of the lean tools working with our supply base to make sure that we
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:13.520]   not only take the cost out of the business but bring those inventory levels down in light
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:30.040]   of current current demand but should we expect so I guess so I guess I have missed that I
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:35.840]   guess you know in aviation you have the you have the drop in EBIT DA in a downturn then
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.480]   the recovery in EBIT DA in the early part of the upturn I was just trying to understand
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:49.140]   on working capital is that cash impact counter cyclical or is it pro cyclical so you're getting
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:23:03.280]   a working capital outflow through the downturn as well as the EBIT DA decline I understand
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:10.400]   these the the high level dynamic there that you're alluding to I think right now the the
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:15.720]   simple reality deviation given the pressures and the crosscurrents is that it is a negative
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:21.960]   and we need to work to improve it how much of a tailwind could it be kind of at this point
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:27.440]   in the cycle I think it's too early to tell we've we've we've got to get on the improvement
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:37.080]   path first Julian to be able to take that potential and deliver it in the financials as a reality
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:43.760]   thank you and then my second question was just around the the operational issues so I think
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.120]   it sounds like the cost out tailwind should build through the year but in Q1 you had some
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:55.080]   operational issues in power on the on the service side you know steep decrementals even with
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:02.280]   the fixed cost down 16% renewables the margins were down despite a big revenue increase so
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:08.080]   I guess what's the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:16.400]   these cost savings over the balance of the year well I think you have to take it business
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:27.680]   by business right if you look at what happened in power clearly the the push out by customers
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:34.040]   because of their own site restrictions and by us on the back of the travel restrictions
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:41.080]   really pushed a lot of high margin revenue out of the quarter and probably out of the first
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:50.560]   half that was on top of some cost pressures of our own making which we need to we need
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:58.840]   to improve upon but I think in power I believe that the team is doing a very nice job working
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:06.200]   off the the so-called inheritance taxes driving real cost improvements you see that in the
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:11.440]   headcount reductions here in the first quarter and as we get to a more normalized service
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.800]   environment I think you'll continue to see that that turnaround continue to take flight I think
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:24.720]   in renewables Julian it's a different dynamic yes we had phenomenal revenue growth in the
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:30.680]   quarter double the the onshore turbine deliveries here in the US got a little bit of a little
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:37.440]   bit better price about a point of price which is encouraging to see but it is by nature
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:44.920]   a very low gross margin business so the growth isn't high calorie unfortunately we had a
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:51.740]   few well we figure one offs but they're not one off until they go away permanently costs
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:59.160]   and execution issues all the while the the turnarounds in hydro and grid are I think moving forward
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:04.880]   but it's early days and they have a number of inheritance taxes that will take a few
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:11.160]   years to work through so I think the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:16.680]   those turnarounds in power and renewables they're dealing with different dynamics in the respective
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:23.280]   businesses and that's really why I think I have the the confidence to say that you should
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:29.880]   expect a detrimental margins sequentially to improve the restructuring and the cost actions
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:36.360]   should present themselves and improve in improved decrementals in the back half but we've got
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:45.600]   work to do to make that to make that happen great thank you for more free search we have
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:52.240]   Nigel Coe please go ahead thanks Julian thanks good morning everyone and Karina great to
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.480]   see you on board so look we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:05.640]   color in the in the queue so Larry is it now a base case that industrial free cash flow
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.880]   will be negative and maybe just address the risk of significant you know cash burn this
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.600]   year or you know is there enough on the on the cost outs and on the working capital side
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:22.840]   to maybe mitigate some of that pressure and keep industrial free cash relatively steady
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:30.920]   yeah I think what I think what we're trying to to share this morning Nigel is that you're
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:37.600]   probably three things one we've been very we've been hit hard and fast here right in some
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:45.440]   of our most important highest margin businesses be at aviation and services particularly gas
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:53.920]   power services pdx and in healthcare we think that that gets gets worse before it gets better
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:02.120]   particularly here in the second quarter with a full effect it's uncertain as to how things
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:09.320]   play out from from here we're going to acknowledge that uncertainty hence the the the pulling
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:14.040]   of the guide but we're not going to sit back and hope that it all passes we're not going
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:20.520]   to take the view that we've got a sharp debounce coming hence the the two billion of cost actions
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:26.080]   we've talked about in the three billion of cash actions we're going to do everything we possibly
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:33.480]   can to control our destiny here without impairing the the long-term value in the long term trajectory
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:40.520]   of our company so we're telling you what we know today we wish we we knew more but that
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.680]   is really the state of play right now and and the approach the headset that we're taking
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.520]   to it okay I appreciate that Larry thanks and then you know I thought one of the one the
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.200]   real highlights of the quarter was the underlying strengths the healthcare margins you know X
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:00.120]   even X biopharma especially given some of the headwinds you face in there so we're seeing
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:04.600]   strengths in small equipments and and pressure and beguine how does that mix look though when
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.920]   you look at the the the the mix on smaller you know patient monitoring equipment etc versus
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:20.920]   the big eye and how does that clip a mix play out to the margins well we we certainly I think
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:36.440]   the the key thing to keep in mind Nigel is the big iron certainly got hit the lower the lower
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:43.540]   ticket the lower price points be patient monitors ventilators in the light certainly got quite
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:50.280]   quite a boost but it's a small it's a small part of the of the of the business so there
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:55.640]   was a little bit of mix there but but not a lot it was really more function you know frankly
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:05.320]   of the team doing a nice job more broadly recognizing that absent biopharma we needed to tend to
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:12.000]   the core cost structure in all its form in the ACS business right we've been growing health
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.240]   care biopharma leading the way we got some good margin support from that business the
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:22.840]   last several years well now as we think about the seventeen billion dollar core the teams
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:29.240]   really I think put their sights the last couple of quarters on growing that business growing
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:34.280]   it with a creative margin and it's really the cumulative effect that I think you see a bit
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:40.900]   here in the first quarter before we we got hit they got hit a little bit later not as much
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:44.800]   you'll see more of that unfortunately here in the second quarter but I think you've got
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:50.560]   a team who thinks that like many other medtech companies they can grow mid or low to mid
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:58.000]   single digits over time and put more digital into the mix better cost that should give
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   us the opportunity to grow with a creative margins along the lines of what Karen laid
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.360]   out in December and I have no less conviction about their ability to do that today than
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:13.760]   then we did when we made that presentation again mindful that we've got some gyrations
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:22.640]   here in the near term to deal with right okay thanks Larry good luck thanks Nigel we are
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:27.240]   at the bottom of the hour so Brandon we're at the bottom of the hour so we could just
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:33.660]   take one more question sure from RBC capital markets we have Dean Dre please go ahead thank
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:40.880]   you good morning everyone wishing everyone good health and I had my welcome to Carolina
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:49.720]   thank you hey just morning Dean good morning just two questions both aviation a lot of discussion
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:56.840]   about structural cost out and Larry be interested in how have you balanced the the structural
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:04.720]   cost out in aviation with rifts and balancing the rifts and furloughs versus how you might
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:12.320]   be compromising the ability to bounce back when it does ramp back up so that's the first question
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:16.620]   and then the second one just make sure I heard it correctly were there did you quantify
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:23.080]   the leap cancellations in the quarter I know there's delivery deferrals our experience
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:29.080]   in 2008 was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations because customers would
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:34.920]   lose that nonrefundable deposit so what's the expectation here in terms of engine cancellations
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:48.640]   that's it for me thank you maybe I'll take the first part of that and perhaps Carolina
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:57.640]   can take the second I think we are mindful ever mindful that there will be a recovery
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:01.060]   right and we want to be well positioned for because it's going to be very good business
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:13.240]   for GE for four decades but I think we are really trying to again embrace our reality
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:21.680]   and take the cost actions in the aftermarket business and more broadly at aviation mindful
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:28.120]   that we've got a period of time here of an unknown duration but it's not going to be measured
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:34.080]   in months right where that business is going to be under considerable pressure so after
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:41.680]   a period of time is the aftermarket has grown as it has the last decade this is going to
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:50.960]   give us an opportunity to rethink to consolidate all the while mindful of our obligations to
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:57.520]   customers the nature of how the footprint has changed the changes that are probably still
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:03.440]   still coming so there are a number of variables it's very much a work in progress as well but
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:09.260]   I think we've got line of sight to build on some of the temporary action to take permanent
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:17.320]   action to make sure that we we have a lean cost structure with adequate capacity to come
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:23.800]   out of the downturn here well positioned to perform both for customers and for investors
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:30.000]   thank you we'll not turn it back to Steve Whitaker for closing remarks
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:43.060]   or do you want me to answer the question on yeah yeah you were right because I actually
[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:50.480]   mentioned that in my notes that in our backlog which was flat sequentially enough 22 percent
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:56.920]   versus per year that did include roughly 200 new 20 unit order translations in the quarter
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:05.020]   year or I would say the progress we found a very small so far but on top of that we also
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:10.940]   saw GCAS right so we have GCAS cancellation on 69 aircraft in April so that will be reflected
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:22.320]   in the second quarter evaluation backlog great thanks everybody I know I know it's a long
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:33.480]   call and a busy day so if you need more just reach out to us and invest in luck thank you
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:37.000]   ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference thank you for joining and you may
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:37.640]   now disconnect

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star 1 on your telephone.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   If you require any further assistance, please press star 0.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vic Kinney, Head of Investor Relations.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Thank you. Please go ahead.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I'm Vic Kinney, Ingersoll Rand Investor Relations Leader and with me today are Vicente Randall, Chief Executive Officer and Emily Weaver, Chief Financial Officer.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Our earnings release, which was issued this morning and a supplemental presentation, which will be referenced during the call,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   In addition, a replay of this morning's conference call will be available later today.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that certain of the statements on this call are forward looking in nature
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   For more details on these risks, please refer to our annual report on Form 10(k) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   and our current report on Form 8(k) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2020,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   which are available on our website at www.irco.com.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Additional disclosure regarding forward looking statements is included on slide two of the presentation.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   In addition, in today's remarks, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You can find our reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   in our slide presentation and in our release, which are both available on the investor relations section of our website.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I will also remind everyone that in both our earnings release and today's presentation,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   we have included both as reported financials and supplemental financial information to assist with analysis and comparatives.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The as reported financials only include the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment results from the closing date of the transaction on February 29, 2020,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and the supplemental financial information provides results as the transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2018 to provide a full quarter of comparable results.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Turning to slide three, on today's call we will provide an update on the top priorities of the company in the current operating environment
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as review our first quarter total company and segment highlights.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We will conclude today's call with the Q&A session.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   At this time, I will now turn over to the Santérenault chief executive officer.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Thanks Rick and good morning to everyone on the call.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I would like to kick off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by COVID-19
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and all the dedicated healthcare workers, first responders and volunteers who are on the front lines all over the world battling this pandemic.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll Rand employees around the world.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The pictures on slide four are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   who have adapted to the realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Every day I hear of new examples of our businesses providing mission critical products to our customers
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   one thing I am sure about is that Ingersoll Rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and serving our customers at the center of everything we do
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Moving to slide five, I would like to grant everyone on the critical priorities we are following during these challenging times.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   When we close the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   that within a matter of weeks we will be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruptions to our customer supply chain
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   and the day-to-day operations of the company.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us plan, accelerate and adapt our actions
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers and the community.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain times.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And finally continuing to execute on the strategy of the company
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   The strength of Ingersoll Rand team aligned around these three priorities
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   will position the company to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more unified company.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   as well as our execution engine that we call IRX are really at the heart
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   of how we operate as a company especially in these unprecedented times.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   During the integration process we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   One that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   to help make life better.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   This purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams leave on a daily basis
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll Rand execution excellence process.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll Rand.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Turning to slide seven, I would like to briefly update you on the company's response
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   to the COVID-19 crisis since it has been swift and focused around two major components.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   First is the health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And second business continuity not only within operations but across a larger supply chain.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Starting first with health and safety we activated our COVID-19 tax force in February
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   and had a full coordinated company approach in early March just weeks after the creation of the new company.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Our execution approach has served us very well as we are able to quickly implement
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   enhanced site safety protocols and a mandatory work from home policy
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   for those employees who can work remotely.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And it is encouraging that our quick actions have been successful
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   But it's more than just implementing safety protocols.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It's also about supporting and engaging the employee base.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   As a result we have implemented a number of measures including a global outreach program to facilitate employee feedback.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Not only did our team volunteer to take individual pay cuts, furloughs and forego vacation time this year
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   they have thoughtful in-depth suggestions, many of which were actively implementing today.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   From a business continuity perspective, starting first with our operations as we previously communicated
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   we have seen plans largely in China, Italy and India impacted due to COVID-19.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   China was largely impacted in the month of January and February
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   as things are now largely back to normal.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Italy and India saw about a two month line to China
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   with operations being impacted in late March and into April
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   and in this time our sites around the globe are 98% operational
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The supply chain has seen a similar trend as the impact in China is largely behind us
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   The Americas and the Miya regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   In the past few weeks we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Much like our operations India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of May
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   when governmental restrictions begin to ease.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   We are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   so let me tell you about what we're doing here.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Starting with slide 8 through the use of IRX we have been able to build the cost energy funnel
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   to over $350 million with increases across all major savings categories
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   As a reminder we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost energies
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   of approximately $250 million by the end of year 3 after closing.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   in connection with both achieving these cost energies and the associated stand up of the new company.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believe we could accelerate
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   We have dramatically increased the pace having already executed
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   with approximately $70 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The majority of these savings are coming from head count actions already taking in the past two months
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   In addition we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   with RFQs for nearly one third of our historical direct materials fan base already launched
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   In total we are now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   which is approximately three times higher than the original year 1 expectation of 10% to 15% realization.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   We are keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three year time frame
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   at this time to remain prudent on all independent synergies
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   like procurement and I2B given the current environment.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It is not only the structural cost that we have taken out
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   with thoughtful short term cost reductions to protect margins.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Let us move to slide nine to talk about that. In Q1 despite the 15% revenue decline
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   we were able to limit adjusted EBITDA decrementals to less than 30%
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   We expect that these additional actions will yield $40 to $50 million of incremental cost savings
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   in the P&L this year with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   We will continue to re-evaluate on a monthly basis
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   and if the man environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   While we are making some tough decisions to control cost
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   one area that we are not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Much like we did back in 2015 at Georgia Denver
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   and new product opportunities were following the same playbook today.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   such as the man generation and our IoT platforms.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   This is all part of the strategy to play offense now especially as we bring the two companies together
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   through the integration.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Moving to slide 10, let me talk about liquidity.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   At the time of the merger we took the opportunity to reprise our legacy debt
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   while placing the new $1.9 billion dollar term loan to close the transaction.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   All of our debt is a term loan B structure
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   with very attractive pricing as the U.S. components are LIBOR+175
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   and the Euro component is a EUROBOR+200.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The term loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   and there are no maturities until 2027.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   as we finish the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and over $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   As we look ahead we continue to see several opportunities to own the cash
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Opportunities exist across working capital and cash taxes
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense in the second half of the year
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by September of 2020.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper we're evaluating incremental debt
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   or other liquidity vehicles given the attractive rate and covenant environment.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Turning to slide 11 our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   as we're building the culture of Ingersoll Rand with our employees at the core.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   and at the same time we will position the company for future growth both organically
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   and through opportunistic targeted Bolton M&A.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Our business operates in the very fragmented markets and we see opportunities
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   to add niche technologies to the portfolio and importantly our newest strategic priority
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launch several of our ESG-oriented initiatives already.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Overall we have several value creation levers as we look ahead
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain macroeconomic landscape.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I will now turn it over to Emily to work you through the financials.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Emily?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Thanks Vicente.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   On slide 12 you will see the as reported financials for the company.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   As a reminder the reported financials include three months of legacy Gardner Denver
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and one month of the legacy Ingersoll Rand industrial segment in Q1 2020
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   As a result the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Other than to mention that the as reported net income in the quarter includes $197 million
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   of amortization, acquisition, restructuring and other adjustments
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Turning to slide 13, to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   as of January 1, 2018.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   From a total company perspective FX suggested revenue and orders declined 14%
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Regionally we saw notable declines in Asia Pacific as well as sharp declines
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   in the U.S. and Europe towards the end of the quarter, most notably in the ITNS segment.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   This led book to bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   The company delivered 208 million of adjusted EBITDA as a decline of 24%
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   driven mostly by the volume declines in ITNS and the expected downturn in the HPF segment.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4% down 200 basis points from last year.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   However our proactive cost controls within the business limited decrementals to 29%.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company the legacy Gardner Denver business
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   delivered 97 million as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately 100 million
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   The legacy IR businesses delivered 51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   as opposed to a combined 60 million for January and February.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Moving to slide 14, pre-cash flow for the quarter was 60 million dollars on an as reported basis
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   including 8 million dollars of CAPEX.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   The Q1 pre-cash flow includes 63 million dollars of outflows related to the transaction
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   comprised of 38 million of synergy delivery and standup related costs
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   and another 25 million of transaction fees.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   We also paid 38 million dollars of debt issuance costs in the quarter
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   bringing our total transaction related outflows in the quarter to 100 million dollars.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   From a leverage perspective we finished at 2.6 times and while we do expect to see
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   some short term increase to leverage we have shown the ability to delever historically.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   As you can see on the right side of the page we'll remain extremely disciplined on cash
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Specifically internal reinvestments for growth, prudent debt pay down and opportunistic bulls on M&A.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   We have no plans for any share repurchases or dividend at this time.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segment. Vicente?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Thanks Emily. Starting first with industrial technologies and services on slide 15,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   the IT&S segment's first quarter adjusted order intake was 889 million dollars,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   down 9% versus per year excluding effects.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Adjusted revenue in the quarter was 796 million dollars, down 17% excluding effects
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and leading to a book to bill ratio of 1.12 times.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   From a regional perspective Asian Pacific revenues were down in the mid 30s,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   with Europe down 15% and America's down 7% all excluding effects.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   We used this trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   meaning that the APAC declining Q1 is what we expect to see in America's media in the near term.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   but we're staying highly active with the man generation activities and pricing controls
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   where we continue to demonstrate disciplining price, generating over 1% in the quarter.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   While these markets are more opaque than historically, we're using our unique data acquisition strategy
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We break this out into two areas, aftermarket and original equipment.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   For aftermarket and leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   that are connected to our remote monitoring systems.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   In America and Europe we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few weeks of March,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   of nearly 30%, with some recovery in the past few weeks of April.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   We're now using these as a way to know where our service teams need to focus,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   which is approximately 50% of the compressor business today.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   For original equipment we're using the man generation leads.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   We said in the past that the man gen was a leading indicator of orders
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   With more than a thousand leads per week, we have a lot of commercial insight in our system.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   What we saw in the later weeks of March was a drop of 30%, versus what we saw earlier in the quarter,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   with similar trends in America and Europe.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   but still approximately 20% to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers and vacuums,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   so orders down in the mid to high single digits.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   We have spoken about third party industry reports in the past,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   According to a leading third party report,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   the market in the U.S. was down mid-single digits in dollars in the first quarter.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Gardner Denver branded products were flat,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and Ingersoll brand branded product was down high single digits.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   But when you look into the details, you see the power of the two companies.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Gardner Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   while Ingersoll brand took share on high horsepower compressors.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   as well as the direct and indirect channel that both companies have.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Power tools and Lyft, which is part of the segment, had a very tough quarter,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   with orders and revenue down both over 20%.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   that online retailers typically make in the first quarter
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   to support first half of the year revenue.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   However, this quarter, in addition to the slowdown of the market,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   many online retailers switch their focus to household essentials.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Moving to Nongap at Yotaribita,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   ITNS delivered 135 million dollars in the quarter,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   which was down 25%.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Nongap at Yotaribita margin was 17%,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   which was down 150 business points from the prior year.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Other cost mitigation efforts helped limit the incremental to 25%,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   in a segment that typically has basic fundamentals of 35% to 40% before cost actions.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Moving to slide 16, to the precision and science technology segment.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Overall, the segment had solid performance in this economic environment,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   as adjusted orders were 280 million up 2% XFX.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Adjust of revenue was 192 million down 9% XFX.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   On strong prior year comes up 12% XFX growth and shipment delays due to COVID-19.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   In the first quarter, we saw orders growth high single digits
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   in the legacy medical pump business.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   As we are leading key player in several applications
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   like oxygen concentrators, respirators and liquid handling.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into at the bottom of the page.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Our team have been working 24/7, providing modified solutions
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   that can be used for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down 2% XFX,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   with the majority due to COVID lockdowns in January and February in China
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and towards the end of the quarter in India.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in the more industrial and markets.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, PNST delivered $53 million in the quarter,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   which is down 6%.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%, up 120 basis points,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   driven by strong cost controls and productivity, leading to incremental margins of only 15%.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Moving to slide 17 and the specialty vehicle technology segment,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   our priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   We see that this segment can expand margins with the use of the same IRX tools
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   we have used across other segments and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Adjusted orders were $230 million and adjusted revenue was $185 million,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   up 8% and 7% respectively, with a boost to bill of 1.15%.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Growth was driven by the strength in gold, connectivity and consumer product lines.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   The business saw strong double-digit order momentum in early January and February,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   but as the pandemic hit the U.S., we saw a sharp decline in the second half of March.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   What there is a lot to be excited about we're expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple reasons.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   First, last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   where some product was shifted to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And two, the business is not immune to this current environment.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   While April orders were down year over year, we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   We feel this is driven by a couple factors.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   First, in the consumer product line, team people took quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   widely used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And second, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Moving to non-gap adjusted EBITDA, specialty vehicles deliver $18 million in the quarter down 1%.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Non-gap adjusted EBITDA was 9.9%, which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth, investments and product mix.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Moving to slide 18 and the high pressure solution segment,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   the business performed above our expectations in a tough operating environment
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   with adjusted orders of $84 million and adjusted revenues of $96 million down 26% and 29% respectively.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   As expected, the revenue base and the business was nearly 90% aftermarket and the team executed very well commercially
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   with sequential adjusted orders of 6% and sequential adjusted revenues of 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   We continue to see shared gain opportunities in aftermarket and specifically consumables where we saw orders and revenue up double-digit sequentially.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   This allowed us to deliver non-gap adjusted EBITDA of $24 million on margins of 24.6%,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   which was down from last year level of 30.8%, but sequentially better by over 400 basis points.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   As we pivot to the second quarter and rest of the year, a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   We can measure that in multiple ways, but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   As a reminder, each fracked fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   With each truck carrying one pump, each pump has a fluid end and every fluid end utilizes consumables.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   While Q1 and 2020 on average we saw 318 active fleets, the exit rate in March was 240.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter where we believe 50 active fleets due to the recent dynamics in the market
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   will be oversupplied and lower pricing for oil sinful impact on revenues within this segment.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Because of that we are taking very proactive stand to drive the proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Moving to slide 19, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot approach.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Overall, the total company is down approximately 20% in orders as the month began very slow, particularly in U.S. and European markets.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   And by the order momentum throughout April, we expect total revenue to be low in terms of orders,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   both industrial technology and services and specialty vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   While precision and science technology is performing considerably better with positive year over year orders performance thus far
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   as a result of continuous strength in medical pumps.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And not surprisingly the high pressure solution segment is down as the market resets for what will likely be a prolonged downturn
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   that we expect will last for a number of quarters.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   As we look forward due to the uncertain environment that we found ourselves in, we will not be providing Q2 or total year to best manage our business
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   and ensure we are taking the right steps to manage multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impact on cash flows.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   A current model shows that the business will not be on the basis to be cash flow break even using fairly conservative assumptions
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   around working capital and capital coupled with the cost actions we have taken thus far.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   We feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compared to current order trends and coupled with our current liquidity position.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Perrents is like 20 for some concluding remarks.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I want to say that what we manage through what we will know that will be a tough second quarter.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   We feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has no change.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Incluson Brand is a premier industrial company of our transformation.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   We have multiple levers for accelerating value creation while being very focused on the current part of our liquidity.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   With opportunities to increase these by unlocking cash as well as taking advantage of the current rate environment,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   we will continue to drive a culture of execution and we continue to pay attention to the [inaudible]
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   particularly under current conditions to be strategic on both on acquisition.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   With this, we will turn to the Q&A.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, number one on your telephone keypad.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   If you would like to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound button.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Enter yourself to one question and your first question comes from Andy Kapiletz from Citigroup.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Your line is open.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Good morning guys. How are you?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Good morning Andy. Getting you?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Vicente, can you give us more color into the April order declines you're seeing in your largest segment in ITNS?
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   First of all, how long do you think the change in customer behavior from that power tool business
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   is a smaller option in exposure in ITNS?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So are there discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   given they're more project versus the industrial compressor business?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Yeah, Andy, let me just give you a little bit of color.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   As you saw, we said roughly April total order is down 20%, both to build greater than one.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   From a both to build perspective, the industrial technology
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   and the precision and science were greater than one and obviously leading the way.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   In terms of ITNS in particular, I will categorize it as the short cycle was most impacted in the quarter
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   and continue to see some relatively weakness here moving forward.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   It's mostly correlated to maybe the PMI from the down and the mainstream
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   which is what we consider to be more on the long cycle.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   I'll say comparatively a bit more stable in the first quarter and we kind of continue to see maybe some of that in the month of April.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Again, typically we tend to get the orders for that long cycle now in the first half of the year
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   in order to get shipments in the second half.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   From a PTO, from a power to perspective, yeah, I mean rough quarter in Q1, as I alluded,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   I mean last year there were seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion into online retailers
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   and you saw that in the first quarter many of these online retailers moved
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   to having other kind of more household goods or critical needs to fight COVID-19
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and clearly this business saw some of the impact.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I'll say April sale is relatively slow so we haven't seen the people with the momentum of the power to business.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   So that's helpful Vicente and I'm sure you expect us to ask about decremental margin in some way.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   So let me just ask you like this, obviously good result in Q1 of close to 30.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   How do I think about decrementals with high pressure solutions,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   the orders down 80%, can you hold decrementals there in the mid-40s?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   At what point the fixed cost becomes a problem?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   I know you talked about accelerated, the rest of the business, can the rest of the business hold 30% decrementals
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall in the rest of the business?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Yeah, so I'll say Andy, I mean that's kind of what we're targeting for and I mean as you have seen,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   we have performed well in the down cycles in the past.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I think we have a good solid playbook that we executed in the 1516 that included both not only in the industrial downturn
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   but also an upstream downturn.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Base decrementals, they tend to be around 40% across the business with slightly higher in businesses
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   like the high pressure as you mentioned as well as the precision and science
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   because of the nice high gross margins that those businesses have.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And lower on the specialty vehicles and the industrial technologies they tend to play in that kind of 40% range.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   You've seen that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies and the short term actions to protect the margin.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   We saw as you mentioned some very good first quarter results for the total business under 30%
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and Q2 will clearly see a bit more pressure from a top line perspective
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   but we will continue to manage the decrementals with the target being closer to that 30% of the EBITDA.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And when you think about the actions, we're clearly taking much more aggressive actions
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   and the high pressure around cost actions based on what we see here with a lot of our data points
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Very helpful to send this. Stay well.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Thank you. You too Andy.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Hi. Good morning.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Good morning Julian.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Morning. Maybe just a first question on that point on decremental margins.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   So if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the year
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   and also about 40 to 50 million of other cost out actions
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   then to those mean that decremental margins narrow or not necessarily
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   depending on your mix and some other things?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   He maybe break it down into the two buckets as Julian suggested.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   The 40 to 50 that we spoke about that are kind of more related to discretionary or kind of volume related
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   and largely second quarter and the third quarter with a good majority I would say more so on the second quarter
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   from the cost synergy perspective million dollars out of 80 to 90 million dollars of in year
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   roughly account and I would say that is kind of consistent
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   third quarter and fourth quarter while the other roughly 10 to 20 million dollars that comes from procurement
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   it is really more weighted towards that kind of Q3 and Q4.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Then maybe just my second question for you all for Emily around the free cash flow.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   You had a good performance in Q1. Just wondered you had assumptions around breakeven free cash
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   but assume you didn't play out.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   You know what kind of sales are down call it 20, 25% for the year.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   What type of free cash flow conversion should we expect?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   How do you see working capital moving?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   You had I think in the free cash that 63 million dollars of transaction and separation cash cost in Q1.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   What's the rough assumption for the year?
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Yes, we're very pleased with the Q1 cash performance as you saw there Julian
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and we've been managing cash you know from to put in good processes and strong controls around it
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   given the current crisis.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   We expect cash to still be to move forward but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move through
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   and we're really managing you know payments as the collections we're receiving
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   You know what the future holds a lot of that's going to depend on time for sure
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   but we know we'll maintain our cash position and our liquidity.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And how about the costs? Any very rough guide post for the year in light of that 63 million in Q1?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   There will be some incremental cash.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   I don't have the figure at my fingertips at the moment Julian but I can get back to you on that.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Your next question comes from Michael Holler and from Baird.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Morning everyone hope everyone's doing well.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   So can we just talk about the synergy funnel you referenced?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   What are some of the incremental sources that you originally identified 250 years ago?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Maybe talk about the difference you're seeing in the longer term some of the revenue synergy opportunities you're seeing.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   As you recall you know we always said that we were going for you know we were 60 days into the transaction
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   we have all these visibility as to what that funnel could potentially be.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Roughly the hundred million dollars comes from a combination of structural savings
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   and rationalization kind of non-manufacturing alluded to on the investor side.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   We have now pretty good database of all the locations across the world
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and that is giving us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Not so much the amount coming year two year three but more the other kind of perspective.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   So second part of the question equities in a strong position some of the one off things
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   operation and some of the extra things I'm only just referenced.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   What would it take for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the cash out flow?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And then second area related to that that we're going into some sort of recession here.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Who knows how long this opportunity is going to accelerate you to play capital more toward the M&A side of things
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   over the next couple years and are you positioned for that today and any kind of thoughts
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   and how you're thinking similarly about that capital side over the next six nine plus months?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Yeah, no absolutely Mike.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   I mean I think you know clearly over the next couple years continue to be a really hard of our strategy.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   You know we see it's a very unique environment right now.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   We still see at this point in time some very good funnel also very good funnel around you know industrial technologies
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   but there are really more related towards both ends.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Thank you.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Your next question comes from Nigel Koh from Wolff Research.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Your line is open.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Good morning. How are you guys?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Yeah good thanks.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   A little bit of performance and it seems like most of that came from the legacy IR businesses.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Can you maybe just kind of spell out a bit more detail?
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   How much of that can be explained by the jokes of the industrial of the IR?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Also what happened to service during the quarter?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Nigel what happened to what?
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Yeah what happened to service?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Yeah I think China was definitely impacted largely in January and February.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   The legacy IR business they have a pretty sizable China exposure.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   You know in terms of the service we saw service better.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Typically we saw roughly about two times from a percentage perspective better performance than the original equipment.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   And just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here particularly as you know
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   ways of comparing some of the, you know industrial technology is composed of multiple technologies
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   compressors, backings and blowers and our compressor business is clearly within the
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   when we specifically compare to some other competitors there's a couple of data points that we look at
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   so the third party report.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   At the same time you know just to give you further perspective the legacy Gardner Denver business
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   in Q1 orders were down in the low single so in the market and you know since we didn't own the legacy IR
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   for the full quarter we just tend to not comment on what we saw specifically you know
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   January and February that they saw from an order perspective but that hopefully gives you a good perspective
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   as to how you form even on the legacy duty.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Great, thanks.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   This business has become so small now it's so much development but if it is down 8% in the quarter
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   that implies you know is it possible to break.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   Given that you're clearly expecting this business to be kind of like weaker for longer
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   you know would you expect revenue to kind of like just bounce along the truck here
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   so for the next several quarters I mean any kind of that would be helpful.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Yeah so for sure you know that's what we're targeting to be you know the great even even positive
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   I mean we're taking some pretty pretty aggressive actions a hundred percent after marketing consumables
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   so that kind of carries a much better margin profile too as well and you know those factories
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   that are kind of not needed based on volume I mean we're basically keeping them close
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   or very very low exposure so a good playbook on how to navigate
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   have gone extensive work and you know I think we see that we can definitely overcome
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   these kind of long term requirements.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Our plan is that it's going to be down for a while and to the second question you know
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   I mean clearly is a market that as you saw we just invested in new fluid and technology
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   so you know we can be ready for capturing.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Great thank you very much.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Our next question comes from Jeff Sprott from Vertical Research Partners.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Thank you good morning everyone.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Why don't we just come back to service for a moment to send a interesting comment about
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   utilization down 30 percent but how do we actually interpret and apply that
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   to a forward sales are going to be down 30 percent of the service I don't believe.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   I don't know if you have enough data historically to kind of piece that together
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   but what does that down 30 percent tell you?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Yeah Jeff great question so in terms of the historical data we don't have a lot of historical
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   because as you know as you can imagine a lot of these remote monitoring systems
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   and connectivity with the IoT platforms that we both companies have now is fairly new
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   but we have enough data to then break it down by the specific sub end market.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   The indication here is that it's telling us where are those markets that we should continue to play
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   or double down from a service perspective so it's helping us to redirect the teams
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   and it's also helping us to really better serve our customers
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   and making sure that we're still more resilient from that perspective.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   You know in terms of being down 30 percent I mean I think we just see that as a bit of indication
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   to what could happen here but as you gave us a great correlation we don't have a lot of historical data
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   so what we're doing is just taking that data point to keep focusing them on those areas,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   regions and markets that we're still seeing some very good utilization of the compressors.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   And the answers you noted ITS obviously includes more than compressors.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Are you suggesting that those other products there areas outside of vaccines and blowers were substantial?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Yes so for sure yes I mean for sure the power tool and the listing business was one that it was worse than that.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   I mean the power tools they have two main product lines I mean it's that tool business
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   but also they have a lifting business that is kind of more related to factory consumption or factory rationalization
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   so I think you know that was impacted more so and then China as a region was definitely heavily impacted
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   and you know from the other product lines in terms of the longer cycle
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   which these are kind of brands like Nash, Carroll, Liquid Green Ponds and Liquid Green Vacuums
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   those are more longer cycle and those were I'll say more stable and resilient.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Great thank you.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Your next question comes from David Rosso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Good morning. My question is about in the ITS inventory in the channel and you think about some of the recent improvement you've seen.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Can you give us some sense on any sequential improvement sort of a lead lag and also the mix of your businesses being short cycle versus long cycle?
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Can you just give us some sense of the inventory in those channels? The lag you would need to see or that you would experience if say the PMIs got better for example?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   Yeah David I think you know when we look at the inventory in those channels I mean there's just not quite this from a compressor perspective
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   which is obviously the one that has the biggest size of the distribution network and it is also more particularly towards the Garner Denver branded products.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   You know we don't tend to have a lot of inventory because these are particularly smaller distributors, more sub regional lines, more localized.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   They don't tend to put a lot of cash upfront to have compressors on the shelf so to speak I mean maybe on the smaller compressors they may
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   but not on the medium to high level compressors and the inventory will come in more on consumables after market
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   and really move fairly well. I mean they turn fairly quickly.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   You've seen just home clear. Is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in ITS or have you seen some little improvement in order sequentially and I'd be curious is that more short cycle or long cycle?
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   I know a great question here. It is out categorized as stabilization initially and then obviously when you look at it within the month I mean the month of April there's some slight improvements on the second half of April.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   But again was that more short cycle improvement?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Short cycle yeah.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Short cycle alright thank you very much appreciate it.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Your next question comes from Josh Pokolinsky from is open.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Hi good morning all.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Good morning Josh.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   So this afternoon I guess everyone here on the call kind of had the same list of questions so we covered a lot of ground already.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   I guess just with some of the commentary around utilization and with the comments you made around supply chain and eruption.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   How much of the decline that you're seeing and I guess this comment is mostly an ITNS comment is related to customer shutdowns or supply chain and eruption in some form like the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Because I think to some of these points on service or utilization that maybe that's not the steady state of the world there.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Yeah Josh I'll say more so in China if you want to think about it kind of that disruption completely.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Also in the first quarter maybe some disruption from the perspective of in Europe particularly in Italy.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   We do have some very good manufacturing days in Italy and although we stayed operationally most of our suppliers have to shut down.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   I would say that now as kind of the comment that I made before we see kind of days lower demand level kind of getting more stabilized.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   But still not seeing that kind of recovery and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will play out.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Okay and then switching over to the synergy funnel.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   I mean it sounds like the year three pipeline of activity kind of has to stay there as we have to act on other things first since we're manufacturing centric.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Fair to say that the incremental step up in synergies then in the year two is it's smaller I guess.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   Is this more of a pull forward from year two or are you kind of implicitly saying hey we think there's more than 250 here.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   We're working on this as fast as we can and we'll update you as we know more.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Yeah I think that's exactly the case.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   We think we want to keep it at 250 just because we think it's prudent and we think it's prudent because we're clearly focused on a lot of the internal funnel and execution.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   You see how we accelerate it and we execute it.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   I mean this is not just talking about the executed but there's a component around procurement and an ITV saving innovative value that is fully independent.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   And when we did the $250 million cost synergy funnel it was done based on 2019 kind of runway level so to speak of spend levels.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   So we just want to be prudent from kind of going out there and saying that the 250 will increase.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   You know once we're ready we'll definitely and when we see more stability or normalization in the markets maybe we come back with that.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   But at this point in time we're accelerating what we can control and we know that we can control that structural head count out and that's exactly what we executed.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   We know we can control a lot of the quick things in procurement because commodities are lower and we are executing that.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   And we know we can control a lot of discretionary spend and that's exactly what we also executed.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   So we're very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Great appreciate the call.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Steeple.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Your line is open.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   Good morning everyone.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   T, revenue down 8.6 XFX margins up 120 basis points so clearly some very good control on what drove the very good decrementals there.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   How do you see the decrementals going forward and maybe any color you can give us on what you think the long term margin opportunity is in that business?
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   This is, you know, I'll say some very good cost control but also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical business.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   If you remember last year when we talked about the medical business we were seeing upwards of 200 basis points margin improvement and the medical business finishing last year at roughly 30, 31 percent EBITDA margin.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   So again very good momentum from that business and clearly as we saw some suffering in the market the team continued to execute those targets that they needed to get done.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   You know I think when you look at this business that has some very nice gross margins and you know the decrementals, the basic decrementals are typically 45 or so.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   I mean pretty good job that the team did here in order to get the decrementals down to the 15 percent.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   And I'll say, you know, from a long term perspective we'll definitely come back with giving some kind of medium to long term perspective.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   I'll just do a quick comparison and you can see that medical we were able to, you know, not only, you know, just a few years ago that medical business was in the 25, 26 percent EBITDA margin and we finished, you know, last year in the 31 percent EBITDA margin.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   And there's just a lot of good commonalities between the medical and the legacy, you know, PFS and ARO business that are within this segment.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Okay maybe just one on receivables.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   When you look through that do you see any customer credit risk, any collection risk there?
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   I guess it's particularly an upstream comment given the way that market's going.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   But anywhere else you see any potential issues in receivables, how you're going about managing customer credit, those kinds of things?
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   I mean I'll say no necessarily Nathan.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   I mean I think it's one that we live by day by day.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   I mean clearly on the high pressure solution which is, as you mentioned, the most exposed, I mean customers are still paying.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   They take longer to pay but they still pay.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   You know they also realize that, you know, from an upstream perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   So we have been pretty strict in many cases that we need to see the payment or we will stop shipment and then we cease to provide any type of output of products either now or later in the future.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   So I think we're really executing a good label here on collections with the teams.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   Excellent.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Thank you.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   Thank you.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Your next question comes from Nicole DeBles from Deutsche Bank.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   Your line is open.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   Yeah thanks.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   Good morning guys.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   Good morning Nicole.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   So a lot of this has been answered.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   We've covered a lot of ground so far but I just wanted to ask one into next year as we think about, you know,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   approaching our recovery.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   There's clearly a lot of moving pieces here.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   We've got, you know, more structural cost savings coming through presumably.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   You have temporary costs probably coming back to the business and then just kind of dovetailing all of that with typical incremental margins.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   I'm not sure, you know, how best you can do this this entire day but it would be really, you know, helpful to kind of characterize the way you see incrementals coming out, you know, on the other side of this downturn.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   Yeah Nicole, yeah, that's great.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   I mean, I think, you know, we typically see kind of the base, what I call the base level of incremental to be, you know, for the total business between 35% to 40%.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Again, you know, when you look at precision and science maybe higher than that, specialty vehicles lower than that with maybe industrial technologies about that level.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   You know, definitely we'll see a little bit of a headwind as we see a lot of these structural activities that we're going to come through for vision.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   We also see a lot of, you know, tailwinds.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   I'm sorry, we see tailwinds as a lot of these kind of structural costs come out.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   We see some of the headwinds but, you know, as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we kind of work with the teams,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   we'll definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin obviously to be at a minimum of that base or more.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   Your line is open.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   Your next question is from Markus Nittenmeyer from UBS.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Your line is open.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   Hi, good morning everybody.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Just one more on the -- hi, good morning.
[00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   On synergies, I do appreciate that obviously procurement is volume dependent but you flag here 10 to 20 million savings realized in 2020.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   What do you currently assume as sort of full run rate savings out of that way is one of the spend which I think is a third of your overall spend and how should we think about more medium terms for the other two thirds if you assume that a time point in a normalized period gets back to about 2019 levels.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Let's start here.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   Yeah, I think if you think about it 10 to 20, you know, coming in in this year as you go into 2021 assuming maybe kind of current volume levels,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   it will be 20 to 40 million.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   So that's maybe at least what you can see here coming from Wave 1 on an analyzed level at current volumes.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   And that is only covering, you know, a portion of the total spend with Waze 2 and Waze 3 coming up here in the second half of the year.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   Right, and is there sort of an estimate you can give us what that would have been at 19 volume levels, that sort of, you know, 20 to 40?
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   I mean, it would definitely be a much -- let it be higher than that.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   I mean, I wouldn't -- you know, I think at this point in time you could say, you know, 40 to 50 could be upwards of 16.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Okay, okay. And then second question on capital allocation, you flagged in the slides with interesting sort of bolt-ons in PST.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   It's obviously pretty fragmented market. You probably have a share of -- call it 15% in that space.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   How do you think about this? How does that segment look like in a few years?
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   I mean, it's, you know, from an aftermarket perspective and also design, win and replacement business.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   So the aftermarket dollars per se or share is relatively small compared to your company average.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   But how do you think about this sort of -- it just struck me that it was flagged specifically in the slides.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   Yeah, I mean, I think this is a segment we like a lot by the way that these businesses are kind of so niche and very solid market positions.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   And it has just a lot of great descriptors such as, you know, kind of high gross margins and very specialized pumps
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   that are kind of really solidly mission critical in the processes where they apply.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   You know, we continue to see that there's a lot of potential not only inorganic but also organically.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   And we're doing a lot of work on that whether you take technologies like the ARO and combine that with the -- like either a Haskell branded product
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   or a Milton Roy product and then you can actually create some uniqueness in terms of applications and then enter some new markets.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   And that's what a lot of the team are doing is, you know, how do we -- are being thoughtful and mindful on some of those vertical markets
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   and kind of new niche adjacent areas that we want to play in and not only do that organically
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   but then see what all the technologies from a Bolton perspective we can acquire.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   So a lot of really great work strategically going on in this segment to really picture this and how do we kind of double it.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   Thanks a lot. Good luck.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Thank you.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   Hi. Good morning. Sorry about that. I had some technical difficulties earlier.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   I'm glad to hear everyone's doing well.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   You know, maybe just one question here.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   You alluded on the call to share gains on kind of both the legacy GDI and IR businesses.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   I wanted to know if you could put a little more color around what's driving those.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   Is it something on the product side? Is it, you know, some of the end market strategies you were doing previously around,
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   you know, more niche markets like paper and pulp, maybe some competitive pressures from smaller guys.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Just any kind of color you could provide there would be helpful.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   Sure, John. Yeah.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   I'm not categorizing. I mean, what I sort of call is that it is on specific horsepower and what we saw that we liked is that this is in the U.S.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   based on the third party report and we liked because it was very complementary.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   So if you look at the legacy Garner Denver, we saw some share takes in the low to medium horsepower
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   while we saw on the Ingersoll brand some share take on the high kind of larger horsepower compressors.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   I will categorize that as, you know, Ingersoll brand has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the larger horsepower.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   Well, as you know, you know, from a Garner Denver perspective, we have been more focused on the medium to small compressor.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   And I think, you know, this is what I mentioned on the call that this is a great hypothesis that we had on this great merge
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   and combining the two companies because now we have great new complementary products and spectrum of technologies
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   that, you know, a lot of these that I mentioned is on the oil lubricated, which is very good solid kind of core product line.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   But as we spoke about during the April call now also the oil free product line spectrum.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   So again, it's new technology, new products and be able to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the product that the teams are launching.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Great. Appreciate taking the question.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   There are no further questions at this time. I turned the call back over to the company.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   Thank you. I just want to close out by saying thanks to everyone for your interest in Ingersoll brand.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   I want to do another shootout and thank you to our employees that are always doing a lot of work here to stay health, stay safe to safety.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   And at the same time, you know, provide to our customers the mission critical pros that are needed in this kind of current market condition.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   So hopefully everyone stays safe and healthy and we'll look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks. Thank you.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   At this time, all participants are in the least and only mode.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   and instructions will follow at that time.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   If anyone should require assistance during the conference,

[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Mr. Ryan Ventling, Director of Investor Relations.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Sir, please go ahead.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Thank you, Operator.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2020 earnings call.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   On the call today are our Chief Executive Officer,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Jean-Marc Germain, and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Math.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   After the presentation, we will have a Q&A session.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   A copy of the slide presentation for today's call
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   is available on our website at constellion.com,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and today's call is being recorded.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Before we begin, I would like to encourage everyone
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   to visit the company's website and take a look at our recent filings.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Today's call may include forward-looking statements
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Such statements include statements
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   regarding the company's anticipated financial
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   and operating performance, future events and expectations,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and may involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   For a summary of specific risk factors that could cause results
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   different material from those expressed in the forward-looking statement,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   please refer to the factors presented under the heading
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   "Risk Factors" in our annual report on Form 20F.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   All information in this presentation is as of the date of the presentation.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   as a result of new information, future events,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   or otherwise, except as required by law.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   In addition, today's presentation includes information
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   regarding certain non-GAP financial measures.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Please see the reconciliations of non-GAP financial measures
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   attached in today's slide presentation
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   with supplement our IFRS disclosures.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I would now like to hand the call over to Jean-Marc.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and thank you for your interest in Constellion.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Let's turn to slide 5.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   At Constellion, the health and safety
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   of our employees is our first priority.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   We have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   We have provided our personnel with personal protective equipment,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   increased cleaning and sanitation,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   allowed for and enforced social distancing,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and worked to raise awareness with our employees.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I want to personally thank our employees
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   for taking this seriously and following the precautions
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   we have put into place.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   As of last Friday, approximately one half of one percent
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   of our employees have tested positive for COVID-19,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and all of them have recovered or are recovering.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Needless to say, we must remain vigilant.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   During the second quarter, our plans operated well,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   despite the significant disruptions to customer demand
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   from lockdowns in both Europe and the U.S.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   As I'm speaking, all our plans are running now and well.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   We are carefully monitoring COVID-19 hotspots,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   both for the health of our employees
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and any potential impacts on supply chains.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   The demand for our products gradually increased
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   during the course of the second quarter,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and this trend has continued into July.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   However, both levels of demand and visibility
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   from our customers remain below historical levels.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   We took strong actions to combat the effects
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   of the pandemic on our business.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   We aggressively reduced our costs, including flexing variable costs
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   to match production levels, reducing fixed costs,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   and lowering our targeted capital expenditures.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Over 40 percent of our workforce
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   were on subtype of partial unemployment,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   or temporary lay of scheme, during the quarter.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Where appropriate, we have also implemented
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   permanent headcount reduction.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Our ability to flex costs was slightly better
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   than the scenario we provided last quarter.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   This was a great achievement by the entire Considium team
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   and demonstrated our flexibility and resilience.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Our liquidity at the end of the quarter
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   was 949 million euros,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   an increase of over 300 million euros
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   compared to the end of the first quarter.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   We added an additional 50 million euros of liquidity
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   in July through credit facilities
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   supported by the German state,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   bringing our pro forma liquidity
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   to approximately 1 billion euros.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   In June, we accessed the debt markets
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   to refinance our 2021 bonds.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   This transaction removed our unlinear-term bond maturity
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   at the very attractive coupon.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   In conclusion, with the significant actions we have taken,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I am very confident in our ability
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   to navigate through this crisis.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   On slide 6, you will see some of our highlights
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   from the second quarter of 2020.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Shipments were 310,000 metric tons,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   a decrease of 25% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Revenue decreased 33% to 1 billion euros.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Of the roughly 500 million euro decline in revenue
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   compared to the second quarter of last year,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   two thirds was related to lower shipments
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and one third was related to lower metal prices.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I remind you that while our revenues
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   are affected by changes in metal prices,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   we operate a pass-through business model
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   to minimize metal risk.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Net loss of 32 million euros
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   compared to net income of 17 million euros
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   in the second quarter of 2019.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Adjusted EBITDA of 81 million euros
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   decreased 51% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   With a strong focus on cost control,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   we are able to offset a significant part
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   of the volume Edwin's to Adjusted EBITDA
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   across each of our business units.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I am proud of what the team was able to achieve
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   in a challenging environment.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Costadium generated 228 million of Adjusted EBITDA
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   in the first half, a decline of 24%
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   compared to the first six months of last year.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Our free cash flow was negative 33 million euros
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   This result would not have been possible
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   without our strong actions to reduce costs
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and capital expenditures and cash expenditures of all sorts.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   was 54 million euros.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Based on our current view of market conditions,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   we expect to generate positive free cash flow
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   in 2020.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I will now hand over to Peter
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   to discuss our financial performance
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   in more detail. Peter?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Thank you Jean-Marc and thank you everyone
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   for joining the call today.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Turning now to slide eight,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   you will find the change in Adjusted EBITDA
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   by segment for the second quarter
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   in the first half of 2020
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   compared to the same periods of last year.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   For the second quarter of 2020,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Constellium achieved 81 million euros
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   of Adjusted EBITDA,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   a decrease of 86 million euros
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   or 51% year over year.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Part of Adjusted EBITDA
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   of 58 million euros decreased by 21 million euros
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   or 27% compared to last year.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   A&T Adjusted EBITDA
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   of 31 million euros
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   decreased by 33 million euros
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   or 51% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   AS&I Adjusted EBITDA
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   of negative 1 million euros
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   decreased by 31 million euros
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   compared to last year.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Lastly, Holdings and Corporate
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   costs of 7 million euros
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   were 1 million euros higher
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   than last year.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   In the first six months of 2020,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Constellium achieved 228 million euros
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   of Adjusted EBITDA,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   a decrease of 74 million euros
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   or 24% year over year.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Part of Adjusted EBITDA
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   of 124 million euros
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   decreased by 14 million euros
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   or 11% compared to last year.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   A&T Adjusted EBITDA
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   of 83 million euros
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   decreased by 33 million euros
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   or 28%
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   compared to the first six months of 2019.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   AS&I Adjusted EBITDA
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   of 33 million euros
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   decreased by 26 million euros
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   or 44% compared to last year.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Lastly, Holdings and Corporate
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   costs of 12 million euros
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   were 1 million euros higher than last year.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   We expect agency costs
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   of approximately 20 million euros
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   in 2020.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Now, turn to slide 9
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   and let's focus on the part segment.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Adjusted EBITDA
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   of 58 million euros
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   decreased 27%
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   compared to the second quarter of last year.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Volume was a headwind of 41 million euros
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   in the quarter.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Packaging shipments fell by 12%
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   in March of our Newspersak plant in France
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   due to COVID-19.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Shipments to the North American can cheat market
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   increased slightly year over year.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Automotive shipments declined 54%
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   compared to last year
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   as many of our automotive OEM customers
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   worked for tailed production for April and most of May.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Price and mix
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   was a headwind of 2 million euros.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Costs were a tailwind of 21 million euros
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   due to strong broad-based cost control
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   with labor and maintenance as important contributors.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Metal costs were neutral in the quarter
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   as we faced difficult year over year comps,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   UBC supply chain challenges
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and lower metal prices.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   FX translation was a tailwind of 1 million euros.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Now, turn to slide 10
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   and let's focus on the A&T segment.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   decreased by 51% compared to last year.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Volume was a headwind of 46 million euros
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   on lower aerospace and TID shipments.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Aerospace shipments fell 37%
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   compared to last year as aerospace OEM
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and distributors began to reduce orders.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   TID shipments declined by 20%
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   due to lower industrial activity
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   in both Europe and the U.S.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Price and mix was a 3 million-euro headwind
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   due to lower aerospace shipments.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Costs were a tailwind of 15 million euros
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   due to strong broad-based cost control
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   with labor, metal and maintenance
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   as important contributors.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Lastly, FX translation was a 1 million-euro tailwind
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   in the quarter.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Now, turn to slide 11
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   and let's focus on the A&T segment.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Adjusted EBITDA of negative 1 million euros
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   decreased by 31 million euros
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Volume was a 31 million-euro headwind.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Automotive shipments declined 52%
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   compared to last year due to customer shutdowns
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   for a significant portion of the quarter.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Industry shipments declined 16%
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   due to lower industrial activity in Europe.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Price and mix was a 9 million-euro headwind
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   partially due to price and mix
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   as a consequence of weaker market conditions.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Costs were a 9 million-euro tailwind
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   on strong cost control
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   with labor, energy and fixed cost
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   as important contributors.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Lastly, FX translation was a 1 million-euro headwind
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   in the quarter.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Now, turning to slide 12,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   I want to highlight our very strong cost performance
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   during the second quarter.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   In the second quarter, we managed to flex our cost
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   by 83%.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Cost flex represents the change of cost
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   over the change of revenue for the second quarter of 2020
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Effectively,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   for every dollar change in revenue,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   we were able to flex our cost by 83 cents.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   This compares favorably to the 75%
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   variable cost estimate we provided last quarter.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   At the bottom of the page, you can see that
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   each of our businesses demonstrated strong cost control
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   with PARC at 92% cost flex
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   and ANT and AS&I at 75%.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   To put this in context,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   excluding metal and depreciation,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   we reduced cost by approximately
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   100 million euros compared to the second quarter of last year.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   These cost savings were driven by strong cost control
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   across the businesses, including labor,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   maintenance, professional fees,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   subcontractors and energy.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I will note that our second quarter 2020 figures
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   include approximately a 15 million euro benefit
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   from European state employment aid
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   related to COVID-19.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I want to congratulate the team
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   for the aggressive actions taken on cost.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   We will continue to maintain
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   our strong focus on cost control,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   particularly given the uncertain demand environment.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Now, let's turn to slide 13
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   At the end of the second quarter,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   our leverage was 4.4 times
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and our net debt was 2.2 billion euros,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   slightly lower than our net debt position
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   at the end of 2019.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   We remain very committed to capital discipline.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   We reduced our 2020 CAPEX target
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   to approximately 175 million euros,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   a 96 million euro reduction from 2019.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Through the first half of 2020,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   we spent 32 million euros less
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   in CAPEX than in the same period of last year.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Our free cash flow for the second quarter
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   was negative 33 million euros.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   During the quarter, as a consequence of lower activity,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   our factored receivables were lower
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   than the levels that we have maintained in recent quarters
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and negatively impacted our free cash flow
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   by 73 million euros.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   We would expect the reverse to occur
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   as activity levels increase.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Excluding the impact of factoring,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   we have actually generated positive free cash flow
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   in the second quarter,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   which is a very impressive outcome in my view.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   was 54 million euros.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   As John Mark noted earlier,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   based on our current view of market conditions.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Generating free cash flow is a firm priority
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   and we remain committed to deleveraging.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   As you can see in our debt summary,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   on the bottom left-hand side of the page,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   we have no bond maturities until 2024.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   During the quarter,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   we refinanced the remaining 200 million
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   of our 4 and 5/8 percent notes due 2021
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   with 325 million dollars
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   of 5 and 5/8 percent notes due 2028.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   While we initially planned to repay the 21
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   with free cash flow,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   we felt it was prudent to remove this near-term maturity
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   given the favorable debt market conditions.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Notably, this was the lowest
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   coupon dollar bond that Constellium has ever priced,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   a considerable achievement in the midst of a pandemic.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   As a result of our financing activities thus far in 2020,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   we now expect cash interest of 150 to 160 million euros.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   was 949 million euros at the end of the second quarter.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   As John Mark noted,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   we added 50 million euros to this balance in July,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   and we remain very comfortable in our liquidity position.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I will now hand the call back to John Mark.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Thank you Peter.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Let's turn to site 15.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   I want to highlight something that is core to our business,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   sustainability.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   In early July,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   we published our 2019 business and sustainability report,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   which you can find on our website.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I'd like to point out a few highlights from 2019.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Safety is our first priority.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Our target is to reduce our recordable case rates
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   by 10 percent year after year.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Between 2016 and 2019,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   our recordable case rate decreased by 27 percent,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   and we are trending very well this year.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   This means that more of our colleagues
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   are returning home injury free every day.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   We also improved our energy efficiency by 6.4 percent
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   compared to a 2015 baseline.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   That is the equivalent of 100,000 metric tons
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   of CO2 savings every year.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Further, we introduced the 2025 target
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   by 25 percent against the 2015 baseline,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   and we have a detailed plan to achieve this target.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   As many of you know, recycling is a core competency at Constellium.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Aluminum is infinitely recyclable,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   with 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced still in use today.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Muscle Sholes is one of the largest recyclers
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   of aluminum cans globally,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   with the capacity to recycle over 20 billion cans every year.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   At Northprezac, we also recycle the equivalent
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   of 12 billion beverage cans every year.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   As a company, Constellium recycled over 560,000 metric tons
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   of externally sourced aluminum scrap in 2019.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I am also proud that third parties are recognizing Constellium
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   for our sustainability achievements.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, or ASI,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   is an industry-led initiative to drive sustainability
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   across the entire aluminum value chain
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   from producers to customers.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   In 2019, we received ASI certifications
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   for Zingen's casting and rolling operations,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   and we began producing ASI certified coils
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   for our customers from Zingen in 2020.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   We also received ASI certification
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   of our Northprezac facility
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   under provisional COVID conditions in 2020.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   We achieved the Ecovatics Platinum rating,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   which is awarded to the top 1 percent
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   of companies assessed worldwide.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And we received an ESG rating of AA from MSCI,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   placing us in the top 5 percent of our sector.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Overall, we had a very successful year
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   on our sustainability objectives in 2019,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   and I look forward to continuing our progress
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   on these very important initiatives.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Now, let's turn to slide 16 and discuss our end markets.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   We believe our balanced portfolio of products
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   across end markets, geographies and customers
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   is a competitive advantage during challenging times like these.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I'll start with the packaging market.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Packaging is a core market for constellation
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   and represents 38 percent of our LTM revenue.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   We continue to see strong demand in North America
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   and stable demand in Europe, further evidence
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   that this market is both recession resilient
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   and secular growth.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   We believe the packaging market
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   has long-term secular growth tailwinds
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   driven by customer preference for aluminum cans.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Our customers continue to invest in new can lines
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   with several additional investments in North America
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   just announced in the last week.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   These additional lines should drive incremental demand
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   for canned sheets in the years to come.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   The consumer preference trend
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   is only one of the tailwinds for canned sheets.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   In Europe, the demand for canned sheets
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   continues to grow based on substitution of aluminum for steel.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   In the U.S., we continue to expect the growth
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   of auto body sheet demand to tighten supply
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   to the packaging market over the medium to long-term.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Now let's move to automotive.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Over the long-term, automotive remains
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   the secular growth market for aluminum.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Customers continue to prefer larger vehicles
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   with regulations aimed at increasing fuel efficiency
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and reducing emissions.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   The automotive market will need to continue to lightweight.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   In addition, we expect hybrid and electric vehicles
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   to continue to gain share of the fleet.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   These vehicles are aluminum intensive
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   due to the importance of lightweighting
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   to achieve their range objectives.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Constantium is well positioned to realize the benefits
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   of this secular shift to aluminum in automotive
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   and the electrification of the fleet.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Moving to more recent trends,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   automotive OEMs began curtailing production in March
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   and largely resumed production in May.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   While demand from our customers increased significantly in June,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   we have experienced uneven demand for our products
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   as a result of supply chain challenges and COVID-19 hotspots.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   While we are optimistic about automotive demand
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   in the back half of 2020, the demand for our products
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   will be dependent on the level of production at the OEM.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Let's turn now to aerospace.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Aerospace represented 15% of our LTM revenues.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   The near-term outlook for aerospace remains uncertain
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   due to the effects from COVID-19 and the 737 MAX.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Aerospace OEMs have reduced build rates
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   and it is unclear how long build rates will remain at these levels.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   We expect aerospace shipments in the third and fourth quarter of 2020
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   will be lower than the level in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   In TID, we expect to continue to expand in each product
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   in a diversified range of markets over the long term.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   In the near-term, the defense and rail markets remain strong,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   but most industrial and transportation markets remain weak.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   These markets are dependent upon the health
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   of the industrial economy in Europe and North America.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   It is unclear when and to what extent these markets were rebounded.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   In closing, I again want to thank the Constellium team
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   for their tireless efforts during this trying time.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   We remain committed to operational execution,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   harvesting the benefits of our investments,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   discipline capital deployment, debt reduction,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and shareholder value creation.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   With that, Joanna, we will now open the Q&A session.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Thank you, sir.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   please press BARD and the number 1 on your touchtone telephone.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   If your question has been answered,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   or you wish yourself to remove yourself from the queue,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   please press the pal key.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Your first question comes from the line of Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Your line is open.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Chris, if you are on mute, please unmute.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Chris, your line is open.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Hi, it's your Mark and Peter. Can you hear me?
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Yeah, we can. Good morning, Chris.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   The first thing I wanted to start with was just the utilisation rates
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   and the comments from 1Q.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   I wanted to step through how you saw utilisation
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   in each of the divisions for 2Q and then perhaps for 3Q and 4Q.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Appreciate you don't have guidance,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   but I wondered whether you could maybe concessually talk through
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   3Q versus 4Q and just versus 2Q or any comments
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   you could make on the divisions as an update from last quarter. Thanks.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Sure, Chris. So I'll start with the markets
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   and then kind of translate it into what it can mean for the divisions,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   for the business units.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   So when you look at our second quarter of this year versus the second quarter
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   of last year, you see packaging roughly 10% down.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   You see automotive 50% down.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   You see aerospace 40% down, roughly.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And the other markets and each market is about 25% down.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   This is made of very different dynamics, right?
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   So in packaging, what we are seeing now is 95% utilisation.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   There was a bit of a drop, especially in April,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   with all the lockdowns in Europe, reduction in canned consumption and all that.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   But that has come back pretty strong
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and the U.S. continues to be quite strong.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   So we look at packaging again, recession resilient, secular growth
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   and we're pretty confident for the second half of the year.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   We look at Q2 as being kind of an abnormal quarter
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   because of all that happened in April and a little bit in May.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   If I look at automotive, it has really snapped back.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I think when we talked on Q1, we're talking of 20% utilisation
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   as we were speaking and now we're at above 80%, right?
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   If you do the average of 20 and 80, you get to 50,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   which is about what we experienced in the second half
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   until the reduction in their shipments.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   It seems like it can be stronger than 80% going forward.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   We still are running very well in July
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   but we've seen that this restart has been with all kinds of fits and stops, right?
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   So you've got hotspots, you've got supply chain disruptions,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   you've got difficulties in bringing products from Mexico,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   building trucks in Texas is challenging.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   So you've got all those operational issues
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   that all of us in the supply chain have to deal with
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   but clearly the demand seems to be well in excess of 80%
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   of where we were last year.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   So that's encouraging and hopefully COVID-19 doesn't throw too much of a wrench
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   in that good thread.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   If I look now at aerospace where we're running at around 60% in the quarter,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   we expect more pain in the second half of the year
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   and I think the reason for that is it's a long supply chain
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   and the customers move a little bit more slowly
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   in terms of adjusting their orders
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   and that is creating a bit of a lag in terms of how much pain we take.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   We are in very detailed discussions with our customers
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   in a very collaborative fashion to look at what the second half ought to look like
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   and whilst contractually we could force some volumes on us,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   that's not our type, what they don't need, we don't want to force on them.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   So what we're working through is taking more pain now in the second half
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   of 2021 we start with a clean slate.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   So we would expect some reduction in operating rates in aerospace
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   in the second half of the year.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   So if you translate all that into what it means for the different BU's,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I would expect BAP, packaging and automotive to be better.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I would expect AS&I automotive structures essentially
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   to be better in the second half and we would expect ENT to be more challenging
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   in the second half.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Thanks so much, sorry.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Go ahead.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   I just sort of follow up on packaging specifically
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   where the volumes were down at around about 10% I think year on year
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   and you're saying muscle shoulders is doing well,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   it seems like the US is going well.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   I think Crown yesterday mentioned that Southern Europe was weak.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Can you just comment a little bit further about packaging in the EU region?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Was it down in the quarter because of demand or because you had facilities offline
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   and maybe you could quantify some of the EU impacts?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Yeah, I think so the reason I'm saying more than 90% or 95% whatever,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   not 100% is exactly because of some weakness in Europe, right?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And I think it's got to do with both the reduction in activity in Southern Europe,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   I mean a lot of these countries have economies that are based on tourism
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   and this is not the best year for tourism as we all know
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   and we are seeing there's little clusters and hotspots
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   so everybody's a bit vigilant as it should be, right?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   So that is weighing down a little bit on canned consumption in Europe, yes?
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Okay and just, sorry I had one follow up on working capital specifically.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I just wanted maybe Peter if you could talk through the two queue moving parts,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   obviously you've stepped through those waterfall charts and you're getting costs
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   doing a great job on the cost side.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   I just wanted if you comment a little bit further on the second half of the year
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   and what the opportunities are on working capital in terms of you saying positive for the full year,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   you've already obviously hit the positive number at the halfway point
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   so just wanted if you could talk through the moving parts on working capital.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Sure, happy to do it and just for context, so on the second quarter as we said last quarter
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   we would use working capital and we in fact burned 63 million of working capital
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   in the NQ2 and for the first half were positive 24.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   So based on where we sit today I think it's plausible to think that with auto ramping,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   with packaging kind of continuing to ramp back up that we could lose some ground
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   in the back half of the year so not a huge negative but we could see working capital
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   being a use in the back half of the year.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   But Chris I would say that we remain confident in spite of that
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   that we can achieve a free cash flow position.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Thanks Veda, that's it for me, thank you.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Good.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the benchmark company,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   your line is open.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Good morning.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Good morning Josh.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Just a question, how are you thinking of any tariffs on Canadian aluminum?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Have you increased any inventory expecting that or just what should we be thinking on that front
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   if that comes to fruition?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Yeah, well, we believe it's a misguided measure if it happens, right?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   We've lobbied against it in the past, we've got it removed, it may come back.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   We think it's misguided and it doesn't address the problem which is overcapacity from China
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   from a non-market economy that doesn't play by the same rules as we do.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Now that said, if it happens it's got a very limited impact on us.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   I remind you that we pass through the melt cost essentially to most of our customers.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   There may be a little section of the business where we cannot reprice immediately when it happens
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   but on the other side we may gain a little bit more on scrap recycling as well
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   so not much of an impact for us.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   The reason we're against it is much more a matter of principle
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   because we believe in free and failed trade and really a problem for our finances
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   or our economy outcome.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Got it.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   And then just on the canned sheet front, can you remind us of when your larger contracts are up for renegotiation
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and then just comment around pricing strength?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   So we don't go into the detail of exactly which contracts mature when but you know that we've got a few renewals
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   coming in around the 22 horizon.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   We are making good progress and I think the pricing environment is,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   I would describe it as a mildly positive in the U.S. and mildly negative in Europe
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   because of the specific situation now.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   I remind you that contractual negotiations take a lot of time here
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and whilst we, you know, I say it's mildly positive here and mildly negative there
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   between now and whenever we actually ink a contract, things may change
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   but I think it's a pretty benign environment.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   And our product is in demand.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   I'll brag a little bit.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Our quality and our service is very much recognized.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Mr. Scholz has done a terrific job over the past five years
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   and he's a very strong player in the market now, very recognized, very quality service wise,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   and therefore he's always been.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   So we have strong positions and I'm looking at the future with a great deal of confidence.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Great.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Thanks Josh.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Our next question comes from the line of David Dragliano from BMO Capital Markets.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Your line is open.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Great.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Thanks for taking my questions.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   First of all, I did have one question on the numbers for the second quarter.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Did you say there was a $15 million one-time benefit included in the $81 million adjustability of the dial line?
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   You're talking about for the labor benefit?
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I thought it was a COVID-19 state aid benefit.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Yeah, that's included in adjusted EBITDA.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   But it's not a one-off and it continues.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Those programs are what he's referred to as curbs are by to show much part of short-time work.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   And these government programs continue through 2020 and in some cases in 2021.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Okay.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   So we should assume about a $15 million quarterly benefit from those programs each quarter?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   No, because what will happen David is remember, so in the second quarter we had a lot of problems.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   In the second quarter we had a lot of people on the sidelines, right?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   But as we ramp up, then we're going to have substantially less of that.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   So I think you should assume that in the businesses, so packaging for example where we had some benefit in Q2,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   we should have basically very limited if any benefit in Q3.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   And automotive which is fade away and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating innovation right there.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   But it'll be a much lower number.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   To give you an indication, we mentioned about people being unemployed during the quarter.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   At the trough which is behind us, we had 6,000 people under some kind of an employment benefit or temporary layoff.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Now we're at less than 2,000.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   So it closed dramatically.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Yeah and David, just to put it in perspective, if you get to the fourth quarter,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   the number might be something like 25% of that just based on the utilization rate, just rough number.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Okay, that's actually helpful. Thank you.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And then just in terms of the individual and market commentary, on the aerospace side obviously that's the, or has been the highest margin business.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   And just in terms of the outlet commentary, you framed obviously two segments up, one segment down,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   but the down segment is again the highest margin segment. I didn't really get a sense as to order of magnitude of the down number versus the up numbers.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Can you just give us a sense as to if you believe that aerospace will completely offset the recovery and auto and packaging in the second half
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   or a bit more color on magnitude, order of magnitude on the decline in aerospace would be helpful.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   So it's very difficult to tell David because we're, as we speak, in very active discussions with our customers.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   And at the end of the day, it's so cool that we have to make jointly with them.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   As I mentioned, we've got contracts whereby we can force them to take some products, which they will take and pay for all,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   but then they don't need it the following year, right? So they hold the inventory, they are holding the back.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   They are looking collaboratively with them in terms of what is it exactly they need,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   which by the way, I don't think they fully know now and it's no criticism of them. I mean, it's very unusual times.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And once we know what they need and we look at what cuts do we take, then I could answer your question possibly.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   At this stage, I cannot. I would just say that there will be for sure more pain in auto structures.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   And then, the auto structure in aerospace, my apologies, aerospace.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Now the other thing too is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period in the recent past,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   the second half is always weaker than the first half, right, in aerospace. So that's something to factor in as well.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Okay, and just my last related question is, I think you mentioned, I think average utilization rates for aerospace
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   related demand in the second quarter was around 60% at your facilities, is that right? What is that number now?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   We're running still around that number, but I would expect it to go down maybe to 50% that kind of range.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   Okay, all right, that's helpful. Thanks very much.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Okay, yeah, so it's important to say, we're not expecting it to go down to 30% right here, but not on the horizon.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Speaker, your next question comes from the line of Kurt Woodward from Credit Squeeze. Your line is open.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Yeah, hi, good morning.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Peter, first question on the hundred million year of cost reductions, how much of that would you view as structural,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   and then, I guess just in general, in terms of the amount of cost you think you could take out of the business this year
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   on a permanent basis, can you give us an update on those efforts?
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   So, if we look at the, I mean, so the biggest piece of that hundred million is related to labor, right?
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   So, and that's probably, labor is probably half of that hundred million.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   So, what we're doing now is we are really closely looking at the business and what it's likely to be like for the next couple years,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   and then trying to size our labor forces according to that.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   So, in that regard, I think we would expect that there's going to be some kind of permanent savings,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   but remember, as we kind of ramp up the operations, we do expect some of that cost is going to come back, right?
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   So, you know, I'd say it's hard to give a really precise number on that, Kurt, it's a difficult one.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Kurt, if I may add, we have talked about Horizon 22, right, and one of the strategic initiatives was to look at
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   how do we lean our organization without losing competencies, capabilities, but how do we lean and make the organization stronger?
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   And I think what COVID-19 is doing to us, and I guess to many other companies out there,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   is accelerate the number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   So, along the lines that Peter was saying, I think we'll come out of this with some permanent cost reductions,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   and as we ramp up, we will not ramp up and inject back 100 million of cost.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   How much, you know, we'll remain to be seen because we're really learning as we're doing
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   and we're just in the middle of it now, but we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Certain categories like, for example, professional fees, subcontractors, where, you know, kind of as we work without fees,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   because those are, you know, kind of big categories of reduction, I think we were able to kind of live without a lot of that going forward.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   So, yeah, I think there's definitely a piece about that we can carry forward.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Just to give an example, there are not trivial there, quite revealing, right? So we've got a very strong, you know, R&D
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   and technical support organization, which is, you know, people that are centrally located and go and health plans.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And historically, a lot of the work was done by people going to the location.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Now, obviously, in the past three months, nobody's been able to travel anywhere.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   And a lot of that has been done through remote interaction, video conference,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   but even when you go to a plant and you look at, I got a problem and I need to improve the speed on this mill,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   we've had people, you know, interacting by the mill tool bit on the face time
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   and looking into the rolling mills by face time with a technical adviser on the other side of the planet,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   and that works actually fine, which we wouldn't have thought it would be possible.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   So, in the future, what you're gaining here is, well, you're saving travel time,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   which is not very good for the aerospace business,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   but also you're saving the cost, you're saving the time, which means that people can be on several interventions,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   whereas historically, within a week, you know, it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   So, I think we're going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our space
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   that are going to be quite interesting in the future.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And I think it's going to help us inject more brain and talent remotely with more active.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And Kurt, you know, as we go forward, we may be able to give you more color on this,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   but, you know, hopefully it comes across that we're really looking hard at taking structural costs out
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   and in the short term, the objective is we want to be, you know, kind of free cash flow positive through this crisis
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   and so that we don't take on any incremental debt, ideally.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   And in the longer term, we want to emerge with a, you know, kind of much stronger earnings power.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   So, we're focused on exactly that and, you know, we'll have more to say as we progress.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Okay. Now, that's helpful.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   And then, you know, in terms of the free cash flow, you know, dynamics,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   you mentioned I think it's $73 million impact from backfiring this quarter, otherwise you'd be free cash flow positive,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   which is pretty positive given your utilization rate.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   And now you're talking about 95% utilization and packaging over 80% and auto.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   And it seems like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   So, you know, 75% of your business could be close to 90% utilization in a couple of months.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   I get that arrow is weaker.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   But it would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint, you know,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   unless working capital would be a major negative, you should be generating decent free cash in the back half of the year.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Can you comment at all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year?
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   So we won't put a specific number on it, but we're confident that we will generate free cash flow for the full year.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   And, you know, the back half of the year, I think there's a very good chance that we can, you know, generate some free cash flow.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   But it depends a lot on what happens with trade working capital.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   As I said, we've got, you know, the ramp of these businesses.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   So we want to be a little cautious until we see the pace of the ramp and the consequences of the ramp.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   But again, for the full year, we remain confident that we can generate free cash flow.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Okay. And then just final question on arrow, Mark, you had a comment on, I guess, working with the OEMs to create.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   You said a clean slate entering 2021.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   You know, is that statement kind of reflecting the fact that the OEMs cut very quickly?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   And I assume there's sort of an excess inventory issue that they're dealing with or in general on the supply chain.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And so, you know, hypothetically, your volumes would be below the actual build rate to help them clear inventory.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   So then when you get into 2021, you know, the supply chain is in a pretty good position.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   And, you know, contractually, you said you're not going to force it on them.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   And then, you know, if you're going to help them manage that, do they, do you get anything in return?
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   IE, you know, price benefit or, you know, is this just kind of everyone helping each other?
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Just a little bit of an understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate comment.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Well, yeah, no fair question.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   So I think I've commented in the past on the fact that I thought that the shipments we're making into the OEMs, right into the supply chain,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   were actually higher than what the build rates were warranting at the time.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   And obviously the build rates are going down very significantly down.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Now, so the pain we're going to take in the second half I think is not going to cure all the, you know, inventory buildup in the supply chain.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   First of all, but I think what that does is it positions us for 2021 that doesn't show further deterioration.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   That's what we're into, right, and we want to be in a place where what we supply is by and large consistent with what is being built, right?
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   So that's what we're trying to do, whether we get there fully, I don't know,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   but certainly we are aiming to be better in 2021 than what the 9 months of, you know, post COVID will be in ANP.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   That's one of the goals.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   In terms of what we're getting from the OEMs, we've got very strong deep strategic relationships with them.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   I've commented also in the past on the fact that we're in it for the long haul.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   And I think it's evidenced by the tenure contract we signed with Airbus.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   I mean, tenure is a long duration, never happened before.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   And we did it because it was the right thing to do for both companies, for both businesses.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   And we didn't do it as a reaction to COVID or whatever, right?
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   I mean, that was really the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   So we're looking past the current crisis.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   We've got to get all in the same boat or in the same aircraft and put us in the same place, work together to overcome the crisis.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   And we are not talking about, you know, if I do that, you give me a bit more price or whatever.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   I think it's just a relationship where we want to be in the win-win partnership.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   And we do some things that help them and they'll do some things that help us in the future,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   which I've already done in the past and that's already happened and that's continuing.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Okay, great. Thank you very much.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields from Bank of America. Your line is open.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Hey Peter, one on the markets and then one on the balance sheet, please. So, you know, saw that canned volumes were down about 11 percent,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   but, you know, Norse reported canned volumes up 11 percent.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   I think you guys face relatively the same markets in Europe.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Can you sort of point to why maybe they're having more success on their canned volumes?
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Was it enough per sock being down issue or a market issue?
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Like, what can you just explain that discrepancy for us, please?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   It's mainly, I believe, I mean, I cannot comment on their specific situation,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   but in our case the main reason was that we had to take down Netflix Act for a full week and then ramp it up gradually.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   I remind you that Netflix Act was at the center of a hotspot, the first real hotspot in France
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   and that was a very terrible condition for the second half of March.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   So, in March we continued to ship out of Finnish goods, but then we had to replenish the Finnish goods
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   and that really took down our shipments in the second quarter.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   But we're back to normal now.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Okay, thanks. That's sort of what I expected. And on the balance sheet, it looks like you got a decent amount of funding from France
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   and obviously Switzerland and Germany. You said it was partially guaranteed, but it's also secured.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Can you just give us a better understanding of sort of what it's secured by?
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   Is it inventory or is it sort of PPE and then to what extent is it guaranteed by the French government?
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Well, it depends on the facility, but the big one, the French one, is secured on PPE and E.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   And in the case of the German ones, one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured and the Swiss one is unsecured.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   And the guarantees, the way they work is they guarantee a certain percentage of the principal.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   So it's a normal syndicator banks with, in the case of France, I think the guarantee is for 70% of the --
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   sorry, 80% in the case of France of the principal balance is guaranteed by the French state.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   In the case of Germany, I think it's 80% too.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   So just for our purposes as credit analysts, 80% of that French loan is sort of non-recourse to you?
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Well, again, it is recourse to us.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   What I think the point is is that if you're a lender, so for example, if you're in the syndicator banks and you are lending say 50%,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   your responsibility is for 10 -- oh, sorry, 50%, 50 million, your responsibility is for 10 of that.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   So it's the banks that benefit from the guarantee, not the company.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Okay, so you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks?
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   But one thing -- I'm sorry.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   The government isn't backstopping the loan for you, it's backstopping the loan for the banks.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   But one thing to kind of -- I think is a really important point is our intent in putting this liquidity on the balance sheet
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   was to remove any question about the fact that we have enough liquidity.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   As we said from the beginning and based on the performance in the second quarter, we do not anticipate using this.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   So the French facility we had to draw just by the terms of the agreement, but it just sits on our balance sheet as cash.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   And the German facility that we've now signed up in July, we don't expect to draw that.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   The delay draw term loan, we haven't drawn that.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   And the Swiss facility, we don't have that drawn in most instances.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   And the way we benefit from the state guarantee is through very cheap interest rates.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   That was cheap money and that was important to us.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   We don't think we need the money, so we're not going to pay a lot of interest for it.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   That ended obviously with an inducement for the banks to lend, right?
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Now, fair enough.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   I think the French facility is what, two and a half percent effectively at this point?
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Yeah, that's the code.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   So you don't really have an incentive to pay that off quickly given your bonds or kind of twice that, right?
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   No, no, that's right.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   Now, remember there are some limitations on the use of the capital, right?
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   So for example, we can't use that capital to go and buy back bonds in the market.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   So it's really meant to be for operating needs of the company.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   We don't have a strong incentive to repay that.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   But what we will do is obviously there's some cost to it, right?
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   So as we kind of emerge from the crisis and have a little more visibility,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   then we'll unwind those facilities.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   Okay, that's very helpful.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Thanks for all the color and good luck in the back ask.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Thank you.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrock from Deutsche Bank.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Your line is open.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions and a really great job on transparency and costs here.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   Both very helpful.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Thanks Sean.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Just when you think about big picture, if you look at the auto market,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   there's sort of projections out in the market that will have about 25 percent decline in new cars this year.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   Mostly based on the fact that we weren't producing back in March/April.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   If you look at the used auto market, it's been pretty strong as we've used prices
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   really rising even above last year.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   You talk about how production's been increasing and demand is increasing there.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   To kind of get to down 25 percent, you'd have to have some pretty strong growth in 3Q and 3.4.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   I guess what I'm asking is, do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   with demand pulling through based on a lack of cars?
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   If you can provide a little color what you're seeing there, that'd be very helpful.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   Yeah, so the auto book is strong.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   There's no question it's above the 80 percent that I'm mentioning, right?
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   But we've been a little bit caught by customers just a few months ago telling us
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   we need product tomorrow and then telling us the next day the plant is shut down, right?
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   So we are very vigilant, right?
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   So I think the end demand is there.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   I think that's true in the US, that's true in Europe, right?
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   The governments have injected a lot of money in the hands of consumers through the unemployment benefits
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   of different shapes and forms that you see on both continents.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   And that is pretty good for end demand at the end of the day.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   So I hope it's going to be materializing, and the older book we have
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   is going to be actually real orders and shipments, in which case it should be better.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   But we've seen fits and stops. You see plants restarting and then shutting down
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   because there's COVID infections, or you see people having trouble staffing the false shift
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   because there's too many cases in the hotspot.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   So it's still fragile. I mean, it looks quite good, but it's still fragile, right?
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   That's helpful. Thank you, John Margin. I guess that's a good lead into the next question.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   So when you think about your customers, we've had some shutdowns, we've had things come back online.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   Do you feel that your customers and their CEOs are getting more confidence in their ability to stay online
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   or getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curve there?
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   Yeah, I would think so. I think all of us have made tremendous efforts to provide the proper environment
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   for our employees. It's very interesting. I was commenting on the, you know,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   half of percent of our employees have been infected by COVID confirmed.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   We have had no new case, confirmed case in Europe since the middle of May.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   So I think this is saying something about the fact that when people take responsibility
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   in their daily lives, right, because it goes beyond what they do within our factories
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   or during the eight hours or 10 hours, whatever they work with us, you can have an impact.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   And I think, you know, if people wear masks when they interact with the outside,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   with people they come across, I think it makes a tremendous difference.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   So I hope the reality will slowly or more than slowly settle in
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   and good practices will get that virus away from us sooner rather than later.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   And I think people are seeing the confidence building up.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   I mean, it's human nature. You need to be affected to take steps.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   And I think we're in the process where in many places people are still being affected before they take steps.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   But if you look at China, and China is, you know, going extremely strong, you know,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   it's a small operation for us, but we are above budget, above last year, right?
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   So if you look at Europe, new cases are really on a downward trend, even though there are some clusters here and there.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   And we'll see a stronger rebound. And I hope this is coming to us in the U.S. through the U.S.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   That's great. It's good to hear John Mark.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   And I hope everybody is safe and well over there.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   Thank you very much and good luck.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   Thank you.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   Go ahead, sir.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   Go ahead, Joanna.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   Yes, sir. I am showing no further questions at this time.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. John Marcher-Main, CEO of Constellium. Go ahead.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   Thank you, Joanna. So thanks everyone for participating in the call today.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   As you can see, we are very focused on facing the crisis, protecting cash flow and building a stronger constellium when things are behind us.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Thank you very much and look forward to updating you on our progress in Q3. Take care. Stay well.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   Thank you, speakers, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Yes, Dan and welcome to the next our Media Group Second Quarter 2020 Results Call.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Today's call is being recorded.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Giafani and Vessa Relations.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Please go ahead, sir.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Thank you, Anna and welcome everyone.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I just want to read the safe harbor language after which we'll get to the actual presentation.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   All statements and comments made by management during this conference call other than statements
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements for the purposes of the private
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   security's litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Next are cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   that may cause actual results to differ maturely from those reflected by the forward-looking
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   statements made during the call.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   For additional details on these risks and uncertainties, please see Nextar's annual report on Form 10(k)
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   for the year ended December 31, 2019 and Nextar subsequent filings with Securities and Exchange Commission.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Nextar undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   With that, it's now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to your host, Nextar Chairman,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   President and CEO, Terry.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Terry, please go ahead.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Thank you, Joseph and good morning everyone.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Thank you all for joining us to review Nextar's record second quarter results today.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   As we get started, I want to acknowledge the Nextar Nation team members for their frontline essential work
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   and tireless efforts to provide viewers and users with continuous access to local news
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   and other services despite the challenges presented by the pandemic and recent civil unrest.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   With our planning and preparation, strong balance sheet and commitment to our markets and employees,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm proud to say that Nextar has kept our employee roster intact
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and our record quarterly results again reflect our team's commitment to flexibility throughout this time.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   As always, our Chief Financial Officer Tom Carter is on the call with me this morning.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Nextar's industry-leading scale and diversification are solid executions such as our new business strategies
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and our rapid adoption of cost containment programs at the onset of the pandemic
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   resulted in record second quarter results with all of our cash flow metrics well above consensus expectations.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The 41% rise in second quarter net revenue reflects growth in total television advertising revenue
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   as we draw year-over-year increases in the same space and new television business
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and strong shares of political spending in our markets as well as the 71% year-over-year increase in distribution fee revenues.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   As such, despite the economic pressures related to the pandemic, Nextar's top-line growth
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and operating in expense management disciplines resulted in a 38.7 increase in net income
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   and record second quarter broadcast cash flow adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow with those net metrics growing 28%, 49%
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   and 127% respectively on a year-over-year basis.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   As the world continues to address the health and economic challenges brought on by the pandemic,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   the strengths of our business model and enterprise-wide focus on managing operations for free cash flow
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   enabled us to bring about 21% of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   In the year-to-date period, Nextar has generated approximately $631 million of free cash flow before one-time transaction expenses.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   By way of comparison, we generated a total of $521 million of free cash flow in all of 2019
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   so our growth momentum remains strong even before the upcoming benefit of political spending in the back half of the year.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Reflecting repurchases made in Q1, we have reduced our share count to approximately 45.5 million shares outstanding
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   so 2020 year-to-date free cash flow per share amounts to about $13.86 per share
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and we remain confident in our unique positioning in this environment to again generate significant free cash flow
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   in the current quarter and again in Q4 of this year.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Speaking of the full year 2020, it's important to remember that approximately 60% of our annual revenue
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   is expected to be derived from contractual distribution fee and political advertising revenue
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   which is not expected to be materially impacted by the pandemic.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Specifically, Nextar has solid visibility in terms of our contractual distribution economics through December of 2022
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   as we completed new multi-year retail submission consent agreements representing approximately 70% of our subscribers at year-end 2019
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   as well as new long-term network affiliation contracts with CBS, Fox and NBC.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   At the same time, Nextar has a strong balance sheet including approximately $665 million in cash as of June 30
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   with an access to another $140 million under our Revolving Credit Facility.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   We continually successfully navigate through the evolving challenges presented by the pandemic
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   based on our core value of serving communities where we operate
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   by delivering leading local news and other critical information and content to viewers whether on air or online.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   In this regard, Nextar stations have produced 41 separate town hall meetings addressing state and regional responses to the virus.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Additionally, Nextar has generated over 30 different programs related to recent civil unrest and race relations in our communities.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   With local news and information, while it's never been more essential for Americans,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   the pandemic has changed consumers' media consumption habits in ways that showcase the inherent strength of local broadcast television,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   our content and Nextar's leading local brands.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   As the most powerful and trusted voice in the country, more people are turning into their stations local newscast than ever before.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   According to Nielsen data, even as states and localities began to reopen in the second quarter,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   local broadcast television evening news viewership among adults aged 18 to 34 remained impressively high
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   with year-over-year increases and average cumulative weekly impressions in April, May and June of 151%, 83% and 89%, respectively.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Similarly, on the digital front, Nextar's websites and mobile apps grew year-over-year page views by 250% to 1.1 billion in April,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   with total monthly users up 133% to 96 million.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   We continue to generate strong digital audiences throughout the quarter with weekday and weekend page view traffic across our local websites
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   up 50% and 60% respectively during the months of June compared to the prior year.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Additionally, in terms of unique users, Nextar's digital properties ranked number one in the country in local news,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   number 12 in all of news and information and with the number 33 site overall domestically in June as measured by ComScore.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   As the nation's largest producer of local news programming, Nextar's proprietary content provides essential news and information to users and viewers
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   that is unique and relevant to each of the local communities we serve across the United States.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Now more than ever, viewers rely on television news to stay informed about everything from the latest pandemic developments to the reopening of the economy to the upcoming election.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   With Nextar's market leading stations and sites, deep local and national reach and local broadcast record of being the most influential and effective medium for both brands and politicians,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   we expect to see advertisers continuing to allocate increased spending to our broadcasts and digital platforms as this results.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Turning back to some second quarter highlights, total television advertising revenue increased 18.1% to 319.8 million,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   including political revenue of 21.6 million and core advertising revenue of 298.2 million.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   While local and national advertisers adapted their media plans during the second quarter,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   we saw sequential month over month improvement in our same station core advertising revenue performance from April to May, from May to June, and this trend continuing in July.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Notwithstanding marketplace challenges, Nextar's local sales initiatives continue to generate healthy levels of new business with second quarter new to television and revenue rising on both a quarterly sequential and year over year basis.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   In total, our sales team generated $20.7 million of second quarter new to television revenue, marking 11.3% rise over the first quarter and a 4.5% rise over the comparable 2019 period.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   As I mentioned at the outset of our call, our new business strategies, ongoing sales training, education and deployment of performance focused initiatives combined with our sharing of best practices have proven very effective in our ability to capture ad spend and share in both broadcast and digital.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   We record at healthy levels of Q2 spending by political action committees and from candidates with 2022nd quarter political revenue of 21.6 million, exceeding our expectations from early in the quarter despite the cancellation of some primaries.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Both presidential campaigns recently generated record levels of fundraising which goes well for our upcoming political revenue trajectory as such our full year 2020 expectation for net political revenue in the low 400 million range remains unchanged.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Recent distribution agreement renewals and the inclusion of WG in America resulted in a 71% rise in second quarter distribution revenue to 536.5 million representing nearly 59% of total net revenue.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Second quarter 2020 total digital revenue declined by approximately $9.6 million or 17%, reflecting our focus on higher margin profitable operations while digital profitability was up substantially over the comparable prior year period as our website and mobile app engagement also rose significantly.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Total combined second quarter digital and distribution fee revenue of $583.2 million rose approximately 57.1% over the prior year period and priced 64% of quarterly revenues up from 57% in the year ago period.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   The year over year increase in second quarter distribution revenue reflects the new agreements reached in the second half of 2019 and our realization of trillion meter revenue synergies related to the after acquired clauses in our retransmission consent contracts and as noted the inclusion of WG in America.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Our expectations for net retrans growth remain unchanged for the balance of the year in the mid teens percentage range reflecting new long term network affiliation agreements with CVS Fox and NBC completed in the second half of 2019 and as a result over 80% of our big four affiliations are contracted through December 31 of 2021 and over 70% of our big four affiliations are contracted through December 31 of 2022.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   With our successful 2019 renewal of retransmission consent agreements representing approximately 70% of our subscriber base with approximately 17% of the base to be renewed this year, our significant net retrans revenue growth in 2020 will complement the strong political growth and spending that we're seeing.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Together the affiliation renewals which also include OTT agreements are new retrans contracts and sub levels that remain in line with our forecast we have pretty clear visibility for net retrans revenue growth expectations in 2020 and beyond.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   As we discussed on the last call at the onset of the pandemic we took immediate action to adapt our business to address the economic impact on the US commercial advertising market.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   We implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings and excess of $40 million from budgeted second quarter levels.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Looking at the third quarter while the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising, we're seeing the same pattern of month over month improvement in our pacing data and expect to benefit from significantly increased levels of political ad spending and in fact our July political billing exceeded that of all of Q2.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   While we're encouraged by continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint and by key economic indicators including employment data and consumer spending and at present we're cautiously optimistic about the return of live sports as live news and sports programming continues to generate the strongest levels of viewership across our all demographics.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Additionally preparations for the September 1 launch of WGN America's prime time national newscast news nation which will reach approximately 75 million households across the country are proceeding on schedule and on budget.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   We're in rehearsals now and my first impressions of the product are very positive.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   News nation will air daily from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and will draw on the local regional and national expertise of NextGar's 5,400 journalists and 110 local newsrooms across the country and during the quarter we announced the anchor teams and correspondents for our live three hour prime time national newscast were already attracting strong interest from leading national advertisers at much higher than normal cost per points for WGN America.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Broadcasts will deliver news reporting that is fact based, impactful and unbiased and we're confident that there are more Americans than ever before who are seeking just that.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   In addition to the live nightly newscast news nation's team of reporters and producers will deliver news 24 hours a day online through news nation's soon to be launched app news nation now which will create another opportunity for monetization and revenue diversification.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   As always we remain committed through generating free cash flow, actively managing our capital structure, our cost of capital and our liquidity position to provide the financial flexibility to support our business and enhance shareholder returns as we emerge from the pandemic.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   During the first half of 2020 we allocated approximately 594 million in cash from operations and investments toward debt reduction, opportunistic share repurchases and cash dividends.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Distantly as I mentioned before Nexar continues to maintain a strong balance sheet including 665 million cash on hand at June 30 with access to additional 140 million under our revolving credit facility.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   On the return of capital front in late June we declared our third quarterly cash dividend at the new 56th per share level which was 24% ahead of last year's payout.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   With our 191% year to date free cash flow growth, our contractual distribution fee revenues, our food network distribution, our historically low LIBOR rates which have reduced our interest expense and what is projected to be the biggest presidential election cycle in the company's history.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   We remain confident in our positioning to be free cash flow positive in every quarter of 2020 and we continue to expect Nexar's net leverage to decline to approximately four times by year end.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   In summary while the pandemic has presented challenges for most every industry, Nexar's leading local platforms are well positioned to continue building the top line, maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Over time our disciplines in these areas have strengthened the resiliency of our business and our business model and created an unrivaled local marketing platform while supporting increasing and growing returns for our shareholders.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   With that said let me turn the call over to Tom Carter for our financial review and update. Tom.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Thanks Perry and good morning everybody. As outlined in this morning's press release the actual results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 reflect the company's legacy Nexar operations and results from Tribune media stations which were acquired on September 19, 2019.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Second quarter 2020 revenue from WG and America also acquired in the Tribune transaction is included in core television advertising revenue and distribution fee revenue.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Contribution from Nexar's 31.3% ownership stake in television food network and other investments acquired in the Tribune transaction is included in the full income statement under income or loss on equity investments net and in the cash flow statement under distributions from equity investments.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   The comparable three and six month period ended June 30, 2019 reflects legacy Nexar operations during that period. All actual results also reflect the impact of one time transaction expenses incurred in the quarters both in the quarters and the six month period ending June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   With that with a review of Nexar's Q2 income statement and balance sheet data after which I'll provide an update on our capital structure and some points of guidance.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   On a combined company basis and pro forma for the divested station, second quarter same station net total revenue was down 6% due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately 35%, reflecting a sharp decline in April due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month improvement from April to May from May to June.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Same station distribution fee revenue was up 28% and continuing digital revenues were down 18.2% reflecting local agency services revenue growth of approximately 8% while station website revenue was down approximately 30% due to software local customer buying trends related to the pandemic.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   To offset the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on commercial advertising revenue late in the first quarter Nexar implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives, which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings in excess of $40 million from budgeted levels in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Second quarter station direct operating expenses net of trade expense were approximately 414 million up from 292 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the full quarter of incremental expenses associated with the Tribune operations and the budgeted growth in network affiliation expense as a partial offset to our rising distribution revenue.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Second quarter station SG&A was approximately 158 million inclusive of the Tribune operations.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Same station pro forma fixed expenses excluding programming expenses were down 18% over the year over year period due to synergies related from the Tribune acquisition and the previously mentioned expense reduction activities in response to the pandemic.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Corporate expenses were 35 million inclusive of 13 million of stock-based comp and approximately 5.4 million of one-time transaction expenses. When excluding non-cash comp and one-time transaction expenses recurring corporate expenses were approximately 17 million which came in better than the guidance we had provided in the first quarter call of approximately 21.5 million.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   By the end of April the vast majority of the initial operating synergies of the Tribune transaction have been realized.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Second quarter operating cash taxes were approximately 6 million dollars substantially lower than our guidance of 45 to 50 million due to a timing difference. That 40 to 45 million dollar variance will now be paid in Q3.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Ongoing capex and transaction capex totaled 40 million dollars spectrum repacked capex totaled 13 million and received approximately 26 million of reimbursements from the FCC during the quarter.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   As a reminder we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all spectrum related capex over the course of the year.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Second quarter total interest expense amounted to 82 million up from 51 million in the same period in 2019 while cash interest expense was 78 million compared to 49 million last year with increases due to obviously the increased debt associated with the Tribune funding partially offset by lower interest rates.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Second quarter broadcast cash flow of 291 million as well as adjusted EBITDA 298 million and free cash flow of 200 million all pre-transaction expenses exceeded consensus expectations and primarily reflect the realization of synergies and growth related to the Tribune transaction.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Distribution free distribution agreement renewals executed in the second half of the year and the deferred tax cash taxes as I mentioned before.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow reflect approximately 27 million dollars in distributions from equity investments related to our 31% ownership in the TV Food Network.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   As a reminder we received cash distributions from TV Food on a quarterly basis with the largest payment recorded during the first quarter of each year.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   For the third quarter of 2020 we anticipate recording approximately 12 million dollars in TV Food Network distributions.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   We expect cost savings in Q3 to approximate 25 million dollars relative to the originally budgeted levels as variable cost and discretionary expenditures are prudently brought back online with the expected strengthening of the economy and the broadcasting advertising environment.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   For the third quarter we project recurring cash corporate overhead exclusive of Stockholm and transactions cost to be approximately 23 million dollars and we will easily meet our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance for approximately 120 million dollars for the entire year.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Non-cash comp is projected to be approximately 13 million dollars for the quarter and 48 million dollars for the full year. Transaction expenses will approximate 3 million dollars for the quarter and will decline for the remainder part of the year.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Third quarter operating cash taxes are now estimated to be approximately 150 million dollars and operating cash taxes for the entire year will now come in at approximately 250 million dollars in total.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Non-operating cash taxes associated with the gains on the asset sales and legal sediments in Q3 will be approximately 83 million.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Third quarter CapEx should attribute at approximately 40 million and we're still expecting approximately 160 million dollars for the entire year.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   We're proceeding on budget with our investment related to the launch of WGN America's Primetime National Newscast News Nation on September 1 and prioritize capital expenditures to maintain maximum flexibility in the current environment meaning the timing of certain CapEx can be delayed until later quarters if required.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Finally we expect next star's cash interest expense to approximately 78 million for the third quarter and 325 to 350 million for the full year reflecting interest expense savings related to the decline in LIBOR rates.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Turning to the balance sheet next star's outstanding debt at June 30 was approximately 8 billion dollars and consisted of 5.4 billion of term loans and two series of senior subordinated notes.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   One at approximately 900 million dollars and the other at 1.8 billion dollars with maturities of 2024 and 2027 respectively.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Total net debt approximated 7.4 billion at June 30 compared to 7.6 billion at March 31 and 8.3 billion at 1231 2019.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Net debt for first lean covenant purposes is 5.2 billion with net cash limited to a 200 million dollar amount.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Our first lean covenant ratio at June 30 was approximately 3.11 compared to 3.52 at year end which is well below our first lean covenant of four and a quarter.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   As a reminder our first lean covenant limits cash netting to approximately 200 million.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Our total net leverage at quarter end was 4.47 compared to 5.18 at year end and as a reminder next star's only covenant is our first lean debt covenant which is the aforementioned four and a quarter.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   At the onset of the pandemic next star took immediate actions to adopt our business to the current environment and preserve liquidity in order to best position the company for long term success as we return to normalized operations.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   In this regard we continue to prioritize cash retention and add approximately 231 million to our first quarter cash position for a total cash balance of 665 million at June 30 with an additional 140 million dollars available under our evolving credit facility.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   At the same time during the second quarter we returned approximately 25 million dollars to shareholders through the quarterly cash dividend and made 13 million dollars in payments on our debt.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   During the first half of 2020 we have accurately managed our capital structure, cost of capital and liquidity position to support our business in this challenging environment while enhancing shareholder returns.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Year to date we have allocated approximately 594 million towards shareholder value creating initiatives including 473 million dollars in debt reduction, 51 million dollars in dividend payments and 73 million dollars in share repurchase.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   In the near time while preliminary data suggests ongoing sequential improvement in economic trends and the commercial advertising environment we continue to focus on cash preservation in order to optimize our financial flexibility as we move through the third quarter.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Looking ahead we continue double digit year over year growth and distribution revenue and what are expected to be robust spending levels related to the upcoming presidential election which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   We have excellent visibility on over 50% of our annual revenue in 2020. As such we expect to breathe free cash flow positive in the third and fourth quarters. In addition to continuing our dividend payments we remain committed to allocating the vast majority of our free cash flow towards leverage deduction and confident in reaching our target level for the reduced level of co net leverage to four times by year end 2020.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Next star has already made significant progress on our leverage reduction plan and we enjoy a strong cash position with additional capacity under our revolver. In addition the reduction in interest rate expense related to the favorable LIBOR rates operating expense savings and our capital allocation prioritization will also serve us well in the second half of 2020.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   As a result we are confident in our liquidity position and ability to serve us our depth through these challenging times and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues as we move through the year.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   In summary despite the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic our scale leadership flexibility synergy realization and operation plans are generating results.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Our capital structure is in great shape from a cost of capital maturity and ability to quickly address leverage. In addition our service to our local communities and local and national advertisers has never been stronger.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth as well as consistency and visibility to our results and we remain confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value in the near term and on the other side of the pandemic.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   That concludes the financial review for the call. I'll now turn it over back to Perry for some closing remarks before Q&A.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Thanks very much Tom. In summary I hope that our comments today reinforce the fact that we remain confident in the strength and the resilience of next star's scaled and diversified business model.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Next star's leading local platform is well positioned to withstand this environment through the several factors including our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs, the continued growth of our distribution revenue stream and what are projected to be record levels of political spending here in 2020.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   In terms of capital allocation we believe that our free cash flow combined with the active management of both our cost structure and our balance sheet will provide us with financial flexibility to continue supporting our shareholder value creation initiatives.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   As a result next star is well positioned to fully participate in the recovery and we remain highly confident in our core strategies in terms of serving the communities where we have operations and building the top line maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   This focus combined with our time proven operating strategies is enabling next star to overcome the near term challenges and extend our long term record of growth and shareholder value creation.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   We look forward very much to catching up with you with another positive report just after election day and on behalf of the entire next star nation our board and our management team thank you for your continued interest support and for joining us today.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   So now let's open the call to Q&A to address your specific areas of interest operator. Yes sir Dean Kingerl and if you would like to ask a question please send us by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Again that is star one if you would like to ask a question and we'll take our first question from John Janities with Wolf Research.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Thank you, two for you. One is you talked about local news and viewership. What are you seeing in terms of advertising and growth and news relative to the day parts given the ratings you spoke to and then I guess the sub level of the line of expectations is the re true that there's been no noticeable impact from the pandemic or is that just your call given the lie?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Well as it relates to local news you know through the first six months of this year 51% of our total advertising revenue came from local news and that's up over the prior years cumulative totals which indicates obviously advertisers you know are putting their money into that product with increasing frequency.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Obviously the demand is where the audience is and that's where the audience is for us right now and so we do see continued read through and we're hopeful that the audience gains at least some of them will be sticky when you know and I hate to use this term when the new normal settles in as to whatever that is but so far through this normal people in all age groups are tuning to our local news broadcasts in increasing numbers.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   I will say that I mean obviously MBPD's have reported sub counts and attrition for the quarter you know those are factored into our projections and analyses and our retrans revenue is again we forecast attrition into our budgeting process and we are at budget on retrans revenue and our projections through the end of this year so we have seen no significant decline beyond what we had forecasted.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   So we think it's business as usual from a distribution revenue standpoint.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Our next question will come from Stephen Cole with Wells Fargo.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Thanks. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about your reverse compensation agreement as sub declines are accelerating I was wondering if that's changing the tone of those at all and also does it make you think about moving from like a per sub basis sorry to a per sub basis from a fixed programming fee where you can and and relatedly we have more broadcast content going direct to consumer like CBS all access and Peacock.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   So how do you think about monetizing those households that may not be subscribing through the traditional process.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Sure you know I would say you know the current relationships with the networks are a mix of you know fixed fee and percentages of distribution revenue so there are some that are fungible and others that are not and those conversations are continuing what's in the best interest of both parties to get a deal done.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   So there is some hedge there at this point and we're not ready to call the ball as to what the most preferable term is there based on our negotiating ability.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   As it relates to CBS all access we participate in that we're paid to be a part of that service and our local stream is a part of that offering Peacock we are not affiliate local news affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast offering and we're not sure if at any point they will be.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   But you know we do have this thing called over the air which you know we we reach you know a much larger universe potentially than the wired pay cable universe already working on 16% of our viewers already use that as their as their reception device without the aid of a pay wall and that's available to those who want to quote stream us that way if you will.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And the good news about that is there are far few competitors for eyeballs in an over the air world than there are in a 500 plus cable or satellite universe.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   So again we we are in flux we have a lot of our agreements nailed down through 21 and 22 we do have some that will be up end of this year and early next year and that's where those conversations will we'll center around what's the best type of agreement.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   For both companies to enter into.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Great and then just one on political four years ago we kind of got a head fake at the last minute from the Trump campaign in terms of not spending what was expected.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   I don't think any of us expect that to happen this time but when do you feel comfortable that there's not going to be any negative surprises on the political spending side.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   I'm pretty comfortable in that right now I mean look at the amount of money that both camps have raised that the attendant packs and special interest groups have raised supporting those candidates as well as down down valid candidates.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   You know there are no guarantees in this business but as close to the guarantees I'll make you as there'll be no negative surprise on political advertising.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   That's a pretty good guarantee.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Thank you.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   We'll now take our next question from Zach Silver with the Riley.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Okay great.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Thanks for hearing the question.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   The first one is just if you can quantify the sequential improvement for core in July versus total two feet 20 or even the pro forma year every year change so far in July and then more broadly and I think it's a little bit related to Steven's question.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   The narrative out there has been that the macro environment and growth and streaming is going to accelerate the shift of ad dollars from linear TV to connected TV and streaming.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Can you talk about how well positioned you are to address that if that narrative does turn out to play out?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   I'll let you address how linear you want to get on guidance. Obviously we saw substantial sequential improvement in core ad trends in July versus not only June but the entire quarter.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Tom I don't know if you want to add any more details to that but I'll let you speak to that.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Sure. Well I think what I'll say about July is obviously July was substantially better than the second quarter as a whole and July was better than the last month of the second quarter so sequentially things have gotten better and that trend continues into early Q3.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   As it relates to additional streaming services at some point there becomes kind of a sameness to them and it's all about the content.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   If you have the content that people want they will find a way to consume you whether that's over the air or whether that's through a pay service or through a streaming service that we're paid to be on.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Without our services you have an inferior offering to the viewing public. It is obviously demonstrated that local news is a product that people want and are willing to pay for and so I think we'll just stand by that.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   It's a lot less noisy at the operating level than it is perhaps at the investor level about these streaming services. Is it a fragmenting universe but are they just taking from a wire from a traditional pay TV universe into a virtual pay TV universe and if so and we're on both sides of that transaction.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   It's not nearly the noise that it appears to be in the investment community so we're somewhat sanguine about it. We have a product that people want and we're the largest producer of it in the country.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   It's called local news and we believe that product will stand the test of time as it has for the last 40 years test of time.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Yeah I think that makes sense and one more if I could. Does the -- I guess for Tom, does the target leverage ratio for this year contemplate any buybacks in the second half and can you remind us of where we are in resuming repurchase program? Thanks.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   It does. I won't say how much of it is allocated to stock repurchases. The way we think -- we have an authorization left from the board. We're currently not buying stock but I would anticipate that to get revisited here in the not too distant future.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   So the way we think about it is really starting on Labor Day and quite honestly that's probably not doing service to the fact that it's pretty mentioned July political revenue is very strong and we think August will be as well.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   We are really transitioning out of this being a story during the pandemic just about poor advertising revenue and what's happening there. The other two legs to the stool from our perspective distribution revenue has been strong continues to be strong.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   We're on budget for the year. We're on budget for the second -- we were actually above budget for the second quarter. We're on budget for the third quarter with regard to retransmission revenues.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And then the third leg of the stool is political and that's really going -- that candle is going to get lit here right around Labor Day and run really hard for the two months of September, October and the first week of November.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   So the free cash flow of the company will continue to go along nicely and then get turbocharged by free cash flow from political beginning around Labor Day.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   And as I've said to other people, I fully expect our capital allocation attitude to change from playing defense to playing offense sometime right around Labor Day. We're not there yet, but I can see there from here and when that happens then I would imagine we wouldn't sit here with an unnatural $600 million of cash on our balance sheet.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   We deploy that by actually repaying debt and looking at stock repurchases, but that's a multivariable equation. Tell me what the stock is around that time and I'll tell you what our appetite is.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Right.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Is that responsive?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you both.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   I just want to add to Tom's comment about political. Most folks woke up this morning reading about Biden's buy that he's placing starting on September 1 in 15 states. We operate substantial operations in 12 of those 15 states.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   So just to point out that political will reach a crescendo around Labor Day that will continue on through the first week of November and again with July results being above all of second quarter for political, that's a pretty good measure I think of what's yet to come.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   We remain confident in our political guidance and as that story continues to prove, then I think you'll see Tom exercise more optionality around our cash forward that currently exists on the balance sheet.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Got it. Thanks Gary.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Well now take our next question from Erin Woff with Deutsche Bank.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Yes, thanks for having me on. A couple questions on the ad environment. I guess there's been some fits and start in terms of COVID cases and pockets of the country.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   But the behavior impacts within your markets that have been affected by that and I guess on a related note, in terms of categories, it's given the importance of the auto category. Anything you can give us in terms of how that rebound is shaping up and what you're expecting from auto in the next couple months?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Yeah auto has rebounded. We're seeing better pacing and better results in Q3 than we did in Q2 when dealers were shut down. We're seeing certain of the OEMs move money around from market to market based on where they have cars and that's primarily affected some of the foreign name plays.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   But on the whole, I think our expectations for auto are that it will be less down sequentially going forward as will most of core advertising.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   As it related to COVID, I didn't know if you meant how it affected the company or what we're seeing in our markets, but I can give you a little color on both.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   We have had 145 confirmed cases in the company since the beginning of the pandemic.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   We've only had one hospitalization and that person is fully recovered. About 60% of our employees are working from the facility to which they are assigned. We have another 20% that are reporting to work but not necessarily in the facility, reporters meeting their crews in the field to go to their first assignment and things of that sort.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   We have another 20% that are working remotely and I use the example with our board that everybody in Topeka is reporting to work, however nobody is populating our New York offices because of the public transportation requirements and they don't feel safe and there's certainly no mandate to do that.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   And so that's kind of a proxy for the country. We keep tabs by every market as to various stages of reopening. I would say that all of our markets have some degree of reopening, some more than others.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   There have been some pauses in California and Texas and others on further reopening. Areas have been rolled back, you know, bars and restaurants are not necessarily big advertising categories with us to begin with.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Hospitality continues to be a category where we see no spend to speak of. There is some interstate tourism ads that are going on like if you're in Texas come to Arkansas and vice versa in Oklahoma.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   We're seeing some of that but hospitality for us is a sub 2% category that, you know, is not materially driving our top line. So, Erin, I don't know if that's the kind of flavor you were looking for but I'm happy to answer any more specific follow-up.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   One last one for me and I appreciate the time again. You spoke to the important local news and the ad revenues that come in attached to that to the overall revenue pie.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   If we're thinking about the potential that maybe NFL football is delayed or college football doesn't happen in the fall, how do we think about the flow through of that potential and what it could mean to your revenue pie?
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Sure. I'm glad you asked that. It's interesting at the local station level, which is where we live, all sports comprises about 10% of our advertising revenue and of that the NFL comprises about 60% of that 10%.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   So, let's just in real round numbers say that ad revenue support is half of our revenue and NFL is 6% of 10% of that. So, we're talking about three points of revenue.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   So, from an advertising perspective because of the limited avails that the local stations get in all of local sports or all of televised sports that's not local, it's not that big of a contributor but obviously it has an outsized effect on viewership, on promotional ability.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   And I would say on the national psyche and on people's morale, obviously distributors are very interested in live sports because they know live sports and live news drive viewership, but from a pure financial advertising point of view, it's not all that material to our top or bottom line.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Okay, perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for. Stay well guys.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Thank you.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Our next question will be from Bryan Clant with Deutsche Bank.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Hi, I have two questions. First, wondering if you could give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of subscriber declines in your markets.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   I'm curious how they compare to the overall industry and any color on advertising and distributor reception to news nation and any expectations for when you might see some incremental revenue lift from news nation. Thanks.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Tom, I'll let you re-read the subscriber and then I'll talk about Kia and how's that. Sure. I would say our experience with subscribers is not materially different than that of the MVPDs.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Obviously, we are still getting an uplift from the virtual MVPDs so that the traditional MVPD subscriber loss is somewhat recouped, but certainly not all recouped by the virtual MVPDs.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   And as Perry had mentioned, obviously we factor in in our budgeting process and in our guidance process and attrition rate for subscribers and a unit rate for our revenue.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   And as we mentioned, that was basically in line for the second quarter and early returns for the third quarter are consistent with that expectation.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   So not getting into specific subscriber decline numbers, et cetera, I would say that we see and feel the same thing that the, you know, the distributors do.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   It's just that our, you know, our economics are a little bit different because we've got, you know, rate that helps us offset that, but it's consistent with our expectations.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   As it relates to WGN America, we have had and, you know, Dana Zimmer and her team have been out presenting WGN America to every MVPD with which we already do business and also those that do not carry WGN, WGN America.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   And that's primarily in legacy next star markets and we have an opportunity with renewals between now and the end of the year for an incremental approximately 200 to 250,000 subs that could add WGN America.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   And these are smaller systems, again, where Nexar has a relationship, but there was no tribune relationship that would have included WGN America.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   So there is upside there and I would say that the reception from distributors has been positive, particularly from those who have existing contracts and realize there's going to be additional value add for no additional cost during the term of the current agreement.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   We are distributed on AT&T now as the only virtual MVPD service that is offering WGN America. We are efforting to get distribution at the launch or shortly thereafter on other OTT services and that will be a value add where WGN America is not currently distributed.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   But the reception from both the advertising community and the distribution community has been positive because we're investing in a product that will add value to their businesses as well.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Great. Thanks. Thanks very much.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   We'll take our next question from Dan O'Connor with Benchmark. Thanks. Good morning. Slim Pickens left here after the strong print and all the questions, but I guess I'll ask you one follow-up to the prior, Perry.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   I don't know if you're willing to sort of, you know, good color on subcarriage incremental opportunity.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Is there any way for us to think about sort of timing and higher thinking about the news nation impact itself relative to either advertising or I guess ancillarily with that, your comment on carriage, we know it's going to be self funding.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Obviously, you have plans to kind of expand it. So just any help kind of framing your thoughts on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   And then separately, you know, obviously there's been a lot of noise lately in the digital world, Facebook, Twitter, Advoid products, all of that fun stuff.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   You guys are the largest. You guys have a pretty big network effect and a pretty strong digital portfolio yourselves. Is there any accrued benefit to you guys or do you think that stays mostly in the digital bucket? Thanks.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   I'll speak first to WGN America. We have, I'm very impressed with the job that Dave Rotemann and the sales team have done in assembling advertisers for the premier week of WGN America's news nation.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   Blue chip names and at cost per points that are in excess of, I'm sorry, I should say cost per thousands that are in excess of 50% greater than what standard programming was generating alone.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   So that's a very positive initial indication. We're trying to rework some of the existing buys into the news nation prime time offering and so what we could really use is, you know, an upfront or a fourth quarter scatter market to break.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   But all of that said, we do anticipate an incremental let's call it low eight figure revenue contribution to WGN's ad revenue in the four months of the end of this year.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   And again, given the size and scope of the operation that wouldn't be deemed to be material, but we do even in these conditions expect, you know, a low eight figure uplift in gross revenue there.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   And distribution that will mostly come at the end of the year so will impact 2021 more than this year. There have been some incremental deals done already that will launch WGN America, you know, between now and the end of the year.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   But I would say the vast majority of that impact would be felt in 2021. And again, you're talking a potential uplift of, you know, a quarter of a million subscribers on a, you know, Nielsen reported I think 75 million subscriber base.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   So even that is incremental, but it's all incremental and that's what we're going to do is drive incremental growth out of the assets that we own.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   And then the thoughts on either Facebook, Twitter as it relates to core political, if that stays in the digital bucket or if you can pick some of that up.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   Yeah, listen, I think the most direct transfer could be in political if people, you know, if certain platforms are refusing those ads that money has to go somewhere and, you know, without conventions to fund and without rallies to fund the one way to reach people is through broadcast television.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   So I think that would be probably the direct transfer, you know, with all the boycats and all of that, I don't think you've seen a substantial decline in digital revenue performance on those platforms.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   So at this point, the damage is more reputational than financial and we'll see, you know, how deep the government wants to get involved in taking a look and potentially regulating these companies more symmetrically with the way we're regulated.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   But at this point, I think the financial transfer outside of political to the best of our knowledge is minimal.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Got it. Super helpful. Thanks for the coloring the next quarter.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   Thanks.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Our next question will come from Greg Hubber with Hubber Resource Partners.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Yes, good morning. Thank you. A few questions.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   Last quarter on your conference call, I believe you guys said your retrans subs were down 4.5% year over year. As you guys may know, Sinclair on the call right before yours said the second quarter subs were down about 7%, including the benefit in the virtual side.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Should I assume that you guys were down roughly about 7% for the second quarter for your subs? Is that reasonable?
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   It's slightly worse than the first quarter. No.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Should I assume it's a little bit better than that then? Or can you just help me understand your question?
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   I would say it's more consistent with the second quarter.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   The second quarter, I'm sorry, you need more consistent with the first quarter down 4.5%.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   Oh, I'm sorry, with what we announced, the first quarter, your first quarter.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   But no, I wouldn't say it's down 4%. Correct, I'm not going to get the exact number. I've already said that.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   It's not down 7%, but it's closer to the previous quarter's results.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Okay, I appreciate that.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Can you help us -- your TV advertising pay scenes for the month of August, would you say that those are tracking better than what July turned out to be?
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   I think it's a little -- we have very few days in August here.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   I'm thinking, you know, it's a little too early to be making any comments with regard to that.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   Okay, can you help us then maybe just -- I'm trying to understand then what you're sort of budgeting or thinking the rate of decline for your core advertising could be down in the third quarter.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   I think that's why we're not giving guidance, right? It's going to be down --
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   How much July was down, if you would?
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   I think I told you it was down less. Again, I'm not going to give specific numbers, but July was down less than June and June was obviously --
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   If it's just math, if the entire quarter was down 35% and every month within the second quarter got better, then clearly June was down less than 35% and July was down less than June.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   That's kind of the extent of the forward-looking guidance that we're going to give as it relates to specific advertising revenue.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   Okay. Maybe -- let me ask another question then. In this -- on this virus situation that's going out there,
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   in the states where the virus cases have gotten dramatically worse here in the last several weeks, have you guys seen a material change in the core TV advertising in those markets?
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Is there any significant change or you can talk about that?
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   No. And again, cases in Texas have gone down. We don't operate just in one area that you're in that you might be hearing that news from, right?
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   So you've got to look across 114 markets and look at those states and cases might be reported to be up 30%, which could be 100 cases in a state.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   I mean, you've got to put all of these numbers into context, but I would say no, the evidence is in our results in July and our pacing in August and our pacing in September all substantially better than where we exited second quarter and then we performed in second quarter.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   So the proof is in the numbers. As Tom says, it's just math, but we have not seen any -- and I think I just said this, hospitality continues to be down, auto is improving.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   We don't get a lot of money from restaurants unless it's QSR and they're making mints through their drive-through.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   So, you know, things are -- we are seeing steady improvements and even we're pausing and opening is better than not being open at all and that's kind of our worst case scenario in some of our markets and in others we don't have that.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   You know, this morning we're dealing with the aftermath of storms up the East Coast from the Carolinas into Virginia and up into Pennsylvania and New York and flooding and those kinds of things and those are going to be more, you know, temporary disruptors to businesses until they can reopen than the pandemic.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   And so it's situational and we deal in 38 states across the country and you've got to add it all together, but there's, you know, nothing other than business as usual is the way we deal with things and I think the results speak for themselves.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   And my last question, guys, on the cost front, you guys talked about pro forma cost in the second quarter down 18 percent.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Can you give us a little bit more to how we -- should we think about your cost trends for the third quarter?
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   I know you gave a figure there versus your budget for the third quarter.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   You gave us somewhere one for the second quarter, but just what sort of cost that you could help us a little bit think about that may not repeat the cost savings in the third quarter you benefit from in the second?
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   Thank you.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   I really don't understand the question other than the fact, obviously, we had guided to $40 million in cost takeouts in the second quarter, which we believe -- which we overperformed on.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   That same number for the third quarter is 25 million as we -- obviously some of those are variable costs as advertising starts to return, those costs go up.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   Some of them are discretionary that we will add back in.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   We will travel more in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   We basically couldn't have traveled any less in the second quarter than we did.
[00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   So some of the discretionary costs will get added back in, but that will be more than offset by higher advertising revenues in the second quarter.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   But specifically as it relates to, you know, if you're looking year over year, the majority of the synergies taken out of the Tribune transaction have occurred.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   So that won't change materially sequentially Q2 -- Q3 over Q2 and you'll have some added expense coming back in.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   But that's the extent of some of the pushes and the pulls on expenses.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   You have script -- well, thank you. Appreciate that, guys.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   We'll now take our next question from John Cornrice with J.K. Media.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   I hope you can hear me having problems with a lot of people in the neighborhood.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Two quickies.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Tom, I think the 24 bodies were callable two days ago and I heard nothing.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   Does that mean they're not likely to be called?
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   Well, again, John, I think that's consistent with our message that, you know, in the next 30 to 45 days, I think we will have a better feel on actual political revenue coming in Labor Day
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   and obviously same with another month of core and we'll be able to start making more aggressive decisions with regard to capital allocation in the, you know, obviously in the last 120 days and probably the next 30 days,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   we're still going to continue to take a pretty conservative view on that but hopefully be able to flip the switch and become a little bit more aggressive in the near term.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   Secondly, did I hear correctly that you're on track for mid-teens net returns growth this year and you mentioned that the gross returns is up high 20s, pro forma.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   Did I hear correctly, gross high 20s net net teams?
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   So far this year, our retrans revenue growth has exceeded 20%.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   That is correct.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   We have budgeted for mid-teens growth, yes, well 28 in the second quarter.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   I forget what exactly the first quarter is.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   We budgeted for mid-teens growth in net retrans for the entire year but so far we have exceeded that.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   So net retrans margins are generally, you know, more than a little bit this year, is that correct?
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   No, I would say that they're actually up a little bit because we've included a fair amount of Tribune subscribers that are non-Big Four affiliates where our net retrans margin, you know, is substantially at excess of 50%.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   Got it, thank you very much.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   And we'll now take our next question from Jim Goss with Barrington Research.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Thanks.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   During the early days of the pandemic there seemed to be a surge or a pretty good increase at least in usage and even sampling of broadcast and other video in categories that didn't take or didn't tend to bounce.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   Not sure what happened there.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   But I was wondering if any of that has proven sustainable or --
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   If you would like to cancel this request, please press Star Zero again.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   I'm sorry, I may have heard.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   Go ahead Jim, I think somebody is trying to either record or exit the call.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   Okay, sorry. But anyway, I was wondering if any of the increased usage and sampling has proven sustainable or has it mostly dissipated and did any of that play a role in your retrans negotiations during that period?
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   We had precious few retrans negotiations done in the first half of the year. We had one top 10 that we're, you know, we're pleased with the results on.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   I would say, you know, in my comments earlier I did report that, you know, our viewership and I highlighted the 18 to 34 demographic, you know, obviously was up in April 151%, 83% in May and 89% in June over the prior year.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   Our digital page views, which were in excess of 2.3 billion for the quarter were 1.1 billion in April, that was up 133%. And then in the month of June, just by comparison, our local websites were up 60% compared to the prior year.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   So, you know, there is some COVID fatigue, I think, but I also think there is increased interest in local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news with the diminution of newspaper and radio local coverage and content.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   So, you know, we do think that there is stickiness to this. You know, the long tail will determine how much, but people continue to turn to our newscasts and record numbers and it's amazing.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   You see, ATLA in Los Angeles and WGN in Chicago, independent stations, by and large, but producing copious amounts of local news are ranking number one in all day cards, meeting all of the network O and O's in virtually every newscast.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   This speaks to the power of localism that you're not dependent on network lead in or lead out to generate your audience. You're doing it on your own and we're particularly gratified by that kind of execution producing those kinds of results.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   And one last thing, I was wondering about the promotion efforts to create visibility for news nation as that is, you know, coming to the fore. And also, it seems like CNN tended to fill a similar role to that which you're targeting where it tended to be unbiased, maybe it's a little less so these days.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   And in that era, it would tend to be the place to go when something, an event occurred, but some of the other news, more pointed newscasts politically would sort of gather their base in more normal times.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   So I'm wondering if there's a way for you to position yourself to, you know, sort of gather at least that role and maybe, you know, maybe have something more sustainable. And if this proves successful, do you think you'll broaden it beyond the three hour original timeframe?
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   Well, thanks Jim. There's a lot in there to unpack. I'll try and do my best with it here. You know, obviously, you know, that is how CNN started. I don't think anyone listening to this call thinks CNN is in that same place today from unbiased political lean.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   As I've said before, we have a staff of rhetoricals and two full-time staff that do nothing but check scripts and reporting for unconscious bias and bias in our writing and we've had very spirited discussions about that even in the rehearsals.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   You know, we do think we will be that place to go for news that doesn't make a, you know, 22 minute news hole in a network evening news broadcast or much news on the opinion-based talk networks.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   You know, for example, last night in our rehearsals we did a story on the first women police chief in Colorado Springs and that's not a story you'd see every place else. But again, we've got our, we've got the country divided up into six zones and we have zone producers and their job is to know exactly what's going on in those zones
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   in all of those newsrooms and what might be of interest to a national audience. In addition to the 150 people we've hired in Chicago, correspondents that are also based in Miami, New York, Dallas, Los Angeles and D.C.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   that report exclusively for the network as well as all the behind the scenes production folks that we think we can give a more representative view of America than perhaps what's seen inside the New York D.C. beltway.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   So we think there's a purpose for that and there's a reason for that and the acceptance of that concept now has been very enthusiastic. It's now just on us to deliver.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   As it relates to promotion, we have secured something that none of the other networks, news networks I think are able to compete with and that is to harness the power of 196 television stations across the next generation to promote this newscast on a day-to-day specific basis beginning later this month.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   And if you look at the annualized promotion value that the stations will be contributing on a dedicated basis, it's something approaching $100 million.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   We are layering on top of that on an annualized basis of approximately $20 million of outside promotion expense which primarily goes for advertising on other cable networks because we're just a channel change away at that point on national and syndicated radio.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   We're also investing heavily in social media not only because of the app but to try and drive a younger demographic to an alternative newscast and so we think our promotion spending, you know, all taken together, you know, a nine-figure amount of both cash and in-kind contributions for the company are another asset that will hopefully drive success for this effort.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   And again, it's, you know, it is a counter-programming opportunity in prime time and we're going to do our best to succeed there.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   Obviously, if we are successful we would look at other day parts but we're taking very much of a crawl/walk/run approach to this.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   We want to get it right and, you know, we will grow as fast as our success would allow us to grow.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   So I think I'd leave it at that but, you know, we're very excited about the prospect of introducing an alternative in prime time to entertainment, sports and opinion programming and that the product will reach a -- we'll strike a chord and resonate with the audience and, you know, audience growth and advertiser growth will continue.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   So tune in. It launches on September 1.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   Thanks for your care for a while.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   And that does conclude our question and answer session for today.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sook for any additional or closing remarks.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   Well, thank you operator. Again, we're very pleased at our progress and we're pleased at our strong financial position and we're excited about the launch of WG in America and the advent of the political spending season that will all be upon us before our next call.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   We look forward reporting back to you shortly after Election Day with the early results on all of those efforts and thank you very much for your time this morning. Thanks for joining us.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   And once again that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Aldera's therapeutic
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.800]   second quarter 2020 financial results conference call.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.360]   At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.240]   After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.640]   To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.120]   If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.160]   Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.880]   If you require further assistance, please press star zero.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.640]   I would now like to introduce the company's chief financial officer, Mr. Josh Riedi.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.320]   Mr. Joshua Riedi, thank you, you may begin.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.360]   Thank you and good morning everyone.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.800]   On the call with me are Dr. Todd Brady, Aldera's President and Chief Executive Officer and David
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.440]   McMullen, our Chief Commercial Officer.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.880]   Dr. Brady will begin with an overview of our recent highlights and upcoming clinical milestones.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.680]   I will discuss our second quarter financial results and then we'll take your questions.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.600]   Please note that this morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements regarding
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.720]   future events and the future performance of Aldera.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.560]   Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the timing of planned clinical
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.920]   trial initiation, Aldera's possible or assumed future results of operations, expenses and
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.160]   financial position, business strategies and plans, research development and commercial
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.080]   plans or expectations, trends market sizing, competitive position, industry environment and
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.080]   potential growth opportunities, among other things.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.920]   These statements are based upon the information available to the company today.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.400]   As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical site availability, staffing and patient recruitment
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.960]   have been negatively affected and the timelines to complete our clinical trials may be delayed.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.360]   Aldera assumed no obligation to update these statements as circumstances change.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.400]   Future events and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the company's
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.040]   forward-looking statements including the current and potential future impact of the COVID-19
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.800]   pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial position.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.880]   No information concerning factors that could cause results differ materially from our forward-looking
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.720]   statements are described in greater detail and the company's press release issued this morning
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.160]   containing financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the company's filings
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.000]   with the SEC and with that, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Todd Brady, our President
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.520]   and Chief Executive Officer.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.800]   Thank you Joshua and good morning everyone.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.720]   As our industry and healthcare first responders continue working together to defeat the worst
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.240]   public health crisis in a century, our thoughts are with those affected by COVID-19.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.720]   The seemingly relentless spread of the novel coronavirus has made 2020 a tragic and surreal
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.200]   year but we remain hopeful and confident in the abilities of our industry to develop the
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.640]   therapies necessary to extinguish this virulent disease.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.560]   I again want to especially thank our team for their work and dedication to our mission developing
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.680]   first-in-class medicines to approve the lives of patients with immunological diseases whose
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.560]   conditions are not being adequately treated by the current standard of care.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.640]   From our perspective the key pipeline development to the second quarter was our Type C meeting
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.900]   with the FDA which charted the remaining clinical pathway to an NDA submission for topical ocular
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.640]   raproxalap in dry eye disease.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.960]   The meeting culminated in an agreement to use levels of reactive aldehyde species or
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.160]   rasps the therapeutic target for raproxalap as an objective sign in point for subsequent
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.800]   clinical evaluation.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.960]   In the fourth quarter of this year we plan to initiate clinical testing to assess the
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.080]   activity of topical ocular raproxalap in reducing cure levels of rasps and other objective signs
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.800]   of dry eye disease and we expect preliminary results by the end of the year.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.000]   The timing of the clinical trial is, of course, subject to finalization of trial designed
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   for rasps assay development and potential disruptions due to COVID-19.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.280]   Initiation of a safety study in dry eye disease patients is also planned for the fourth quarter
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.000]   and NDA submission is expected by the end of 2021.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.360]   Our optimism for the use of rasps as an objective sign of dry eye disease is supported by data
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:04.320]   from our successful phase 2A trial in which raproxalap treatment diminish levels of rasps
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.000]   and tears as measured by ELISA following 28 days of treatment.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.720]   For the upcoming rasps trials the longest duration of dosing under consideration is also 28 days
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.960]   whereas the shortest dosing duration is 1 to 2 days.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.280]   Additionally, the upcoming rasps trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.480]   effect of acute changes in dryness on rasps and other signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.200]   We'll be sharing additional details of the protocol following rasps assay validation
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.320]   and FDA requirement and look forward to providing trial designs shortly.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.880]   From a safety perspective top collocular raproxalap already has been evaluated in more than 1000
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.020]   patients with no observed safety concerns.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.800]   In short the safety consistency and clinically significant activity of raproxalap across
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.680]   numerous clinical trials suggests that raproxalap could be an important addition to the limited
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.160]   number of therapeutic options for dry eye disease which affects more than 30 million
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.240]   patients in the United States.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.760]   Looking at other ocular programs in our pipeline, top line results from the phase 3 and Vigorate
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.600]   allergen chamber trial of raproxalap and allergic conjunctivitis are expected in the first half
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.480]   of 2021.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.820]   In the retinal disease area in the second quarter of this year the European Commission granted
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:44.860]   orphan medicinal product designation to ADX 2191 for the treatment of retinal detachment
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.440]   opening a new market opportunity for ADX 2191 and the European Union as drugs receiving
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.480]   the orphan medicinal product designation are eligible to protocol assistance, research
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.200]   funding and upon approval 10 years of EU market exclusivity.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:09.920]   ADX 2191 our novel and proprietary intravitral methotrexate injection is being evaluated
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.480]   in the phase 3 guard trial for proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.000]   PVR is a rare but site threatening condition and the leading cause of failure of retinal
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.880]   detachment surgery affecting roughly 4,000 patients per year in the United States and nearly twice
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.760]   as many in Europe and Japan combined.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.720]   Given the nature of PVR and given the clinical site delays caused by COVID-19 the progress
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.680]   of guard has been slow although we expect to provide you with an update by the end of
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   this year.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.640]   As many of you know there is no approved therapy for PVR and ADX 2191 has received orphan drug
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.120]   and fast track designations from the FDA.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   ADX 2191 is also the subject of our new clinical program in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma or
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.240]   PVRL a rare aggressive high grade cancer that affects approximately 2900 people in the United
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.740]   States with about 600 new cases diagnosed annually.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:23.460]   There are no approved treatments for the disease although the standard of care is pharmacy compounded
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.720]   methotrexate that has been injected into the eye.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:35.960]   We have recently filed for orphan drug designation for ADX 2191 in PVRL.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:42.320]   Turning to our systemic disease programs we are very excited about ADX 629 which to our
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.560]   knowledge is the first systemically available rasp inhibitor the clinical testing of which
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.960]   represents the first time systemic rasp inhibition has been assessed clinically marking an exciting
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.080]   new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism of action.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:07.960]   An IND has been filed with the FDA for phase two clinical testing of ADX 629 in patients
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:15.440]   with COVID 19 in order to prevent cytokine release syndrome and respiratory compromise.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.000]   Clinical development is expected to begin this year.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.640]   In an animal model of cytokine storm ADX 629 demonstrated a broad and highly statistically
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.720]   significant reduction in cytokine levels including TNF alpha interferon gamma and IL 17 while
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.960]   up regulating the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL 10.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.240]   The data suggests that rasp inhibitors have the potential to represent immunological switches
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:53.840]   which may modulate immune systems from pro-inflammatory states to anti-inflammatory states.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.400]   In the fourth quarter of this year we also expect to initiate clinical trials of ADX 629 in
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:06.080]   psoriasis and autoimmune disease and atopic asthma and allergic disease.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:13.020]   In combination trials in COVID 19 psoriasis and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:19.640]   and the results of the trials will characterize the immune modulating activity of ADX 629
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:25.020]   and rasp inhibition more generally.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:32.080]   Switching to ADX 1612 our novel HSP90 inhibitor enrollment has been completed in the investigator
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.960]   sponsored phase two Udario trial in ovarian cancer.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:45.560]   During the ADX 1612 COVID 19 program consistent with FDA feedback additional preclinical antiviral
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:53.040]   testing of ADX 1612 against SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID 19 will be performed
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.360]   by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases which has accepted our request to
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:06.680]   evaluate ADX 1612 and in vivo models we plan to update on the ADX 1612 COVID program by
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:12.960]   the end of 2020.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.160]   We approached the midpoint of the third quarter in a strong financial position enhancing our
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.340]   flexibility with recent common stock sales to two healthcare focused funds perceptive
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.600]   advisors and identity partners.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:35.400]   These transactions raised growth proceeds of approximately 19.5 million completing our previously
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.160]   announced at the market offering program.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:45.880]   We expect our cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations through 2022 including potential
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:53.000]   reproxelap approval in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.280]   Now with that I'd like to turn the call back over to Josh for the financial review.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:08.720]   Thanks Todd for the quarter ended June 30 2020 we reported a net loss of 7.5 million dollars
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:16.040]   compared with a net loss of 13.3 million dollars for the quarter ended June 30 2019.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:22.240]   Net loss per share with 25 cents for the quarter ended June 30 2020 compared with 49 cents
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.560]   for the same period in 2019.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.360]   Results have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research and development programs
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.900]   as well as from general and administrative expenses.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.680]   Research and development expenses were 4.9 million dollars for the quarter ended June 30 2020
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.480]   compared with 10.7 million dollars for the same period in 2019.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:51.520]   The decrease of 5.8 million dollars is primarily related to a reduction in clinical and preclinical
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.600]   development manufacturing and personnel costs.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.320]   General and administrative expenses were 2.2 million dollars for the quarter ended June
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.640]   30 2020 compared with 3.1 million dollars for the same period in 2019.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.640]   The decrease of 900 thousand dollars is due to lower personnel related costs including
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:17.440]   stock based compensation and other miscellaneous administrative costs.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.040]   In the second quarter of 2020 total operating expenses were 7.1 million dollars compared
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.400]   with total operating expenses of 13.7 million dollars for the same period in 2019.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:39.360]   As of June 30 2020 cash equivalents and marketable securities were 66.2 million dollars.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:46.800]   Subsequent to June 30 2020 25.2 million dollars in cash was received from at the market offering
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:54.120]   program sales to perceptive advisors, affinity partners and other investors.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:01.320]   Based on current operating plans cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30 2020
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:07.040]   plus the additional at the market offering program proceeds are expected to be sufficient
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:13.800]   to fund operation through the end of 2022 including potential NDA approvals for reproxel app and
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.600]   dry disease and allergic conjunctivitis assuming positive clinical trial results and planned
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.800]   NDA submission, acceptances and approvals.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.000]   Use of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are also expected to include the
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.200]   continuation of part one of the phase three guard trial in PVR and phase two clinical testing
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:42.160]   of ADX629 in orally administered rats inhibitor in inflammatory diseases.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:48.840]   Now I'll turn the call back to Todd for closing comments.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.520]   Thanks Josh.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:58.640]   We have a number of milestones planned for the second half of 2020 and look forward to executing
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:04.520]   on our clinical development strategy across our ocular and systemic programs.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.560]   Looking at our IR calendar next week we'll be presenting at the BTIG Virtual Biotechnology
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.560]   Conference and WEDBUSH PACRO Virtual Healthcare Conference.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.640]   These events will be webcast please check the events and presentation section of our website
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.520]   for details.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.220]   We always look forward to meeting with investors and hope to connect with you at these or other
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.120]   upcoming events.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.080]   As always we remain committed to executing efficiently on our strategic plan and bringing
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.760]   to market novel therapies that improve the lives of patients with serious unmet medical needs.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:46.000]   With that Josh, Dave and I will be happy to take your questions operator.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.880]   At this time if you would like to ask a question please press star then the number one on your
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.440]   telephone keypad that is star one to ask a question.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.720]   Our first question comes from the line of Louise Stendwith-Hansler.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.080]   Hi thanks for taking my questions here.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   So the first question I have for you is could you get into more detail on the significant
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.640]   the FDA's recognition of graft as a sign for dry eye disease is and what that means for
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.440]   you in terms of potential approval and market opportunity and then the second question I
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.480]   have for you is on your COVID trials how adaptive are those trials in light of the constantly
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.720]   evolving landscape for the treatment of COVID and then how's enrollment gone and then my
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.240]   last question here is you noted that there's been some headwinds to clinical trials progression
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:37.440]   due to COVID can you give more color on which trials may be impacted here thank you.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.140]   Good morning Louise and thanks for your excellent questions.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:48.800]   The RASP development is truly transformative for Aldera.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:56.120]   RASP is the pharmaceutical target upon which the company was founded many years ago.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:05.440]   To our knowledge no company has ever therapeutically addressed RASP and yet RASP represents a very
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:11.600]   broad based anti-inflammatory approach that probably applies to many many diseases not
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.840]   only ocular diseases such as dry eye disease but also systemic diseases.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:25.160]   So for all those reasons we were thrilled about the FDA's decision to classify RASP as an objective
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:32.140]   sign of dry eye disease which as you know is an inflammatory condition.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:39.440]   What it means practically for the company is that the ongoing clinical trial the clinical
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.560]   trials that are about to start regarding the assessment of RASP should be likely to work
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:52.800]   based on the fact that the mechanism of reproxylapin or other RASP inhibitors is the direct inhibition
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:59.600]   of RASP. These compounds bind covalently to RASP so what we're really measuring is a
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.720]   chemical reaction in vivo and in this case in the tear fluid of patients that have been
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.280]   administered reproxylapin.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   And all that leads us to believe that we'll be in a position to file an NDA for dry disease
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.680]   next year as we have previously announced.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:30.800]   Regarding the COVID trial design we anticipate for both programs enrolling approximately 30
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.440]   patients I think they'll likely be a two to one randomization drug to placebo.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:42.920]   At this point we have not included adaptive designs I think the nature of the results
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.880]   of these first trials will help us determine subsequent clinical testing which is obviously
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:56.040]   going to be much more significant if there are positive results from the preliminary outputs
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.080]   that we have here.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.320]   Enrollment hasn't started the IND has been filed for 629 and as I mentioned on the call today
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:16.440]   1612 is the subject of further in vivo investigation in COVID that is being performed by NIAD and
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:25.760]   we're absolutely thrilled about NIAD decision to test ADX 1612 on our behalf.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:34.040]   The COVID impact as you mentioned Louise across the industry has been significant the one trial
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:41.920]   in our case in our pipeline that has been affected by COVID-19 is the guard trial the phase 3
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.800]   guard trial for PVR.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:53.960]   What seemed to have happened during the peak of COVID cases back in March April May and so
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:20:01.440]   forth was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite vision changes
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:12.880]   despite losing sight the number of patients coming in was diminished during that timeframe
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:19.560]   and furthermore many clinical sites as you know simply did not have research staff which
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:25.320]   were considered for a while to be non-essential such that it was difficult if not impossible
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:33.120]   in some cases to enroll patients however the good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:41.040]   we do not seem to be overtly affected by COVID in terms of enrollment the dry eye program
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:50.520]   was largely under discussion with the FDA during the peak number of cases in the spring the allergy
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:57.560]   program the phase 3 allergy program was on a planned hold because of pollen as you know
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:03.400]   you cannot enroll allergy programs with ambient pollen and we expect the invigorate program
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:09.520]   to re-initiate again in the fall so we were quite fortunate in terms of timing with regard
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:18.840]   to our other clinical program to leave relative to the impact of of COVID okay thank you
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:25.400]   As a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star then the number one on your
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.400]   telephone keypad that is star one to ask a question your next question comes from the
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.480]   line of Justin with Oppenheimer in company hi good morning guys thanks for taking the
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.780]   questions and congrats on the progress I know it's early days but you know as you think about
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:46.240]   establishing a process left action on RASC as a sign of dry eye we've had some discussion
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.760]   with the message on what would be an appropriate duration of observation to assess this activity
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.080]   can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the acute versus four week time points
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:02.640]   from a trial perspective disease perspective and labeling perspective right good morning
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:10.960]   Justin and good to hear from you the as I highlighted in my comments this morning the
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.440]   potential range of dosing duration for the RASC trials is anywhere from one to two days
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:23.200]   on the acute end to 28 days on the more chronic or sub chronic end which reflects the phase
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:28.360]   to a trial that is the data in our corporate decks showing that after 28 days of administration
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:34.780]   of reproxelab there was a highly statistically significant reduction in RASC levels as measured
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:42.640]   by ELISA I want to spend a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure RASC
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.360]   RASC exists in our body in two forms so-called free RASC that is RASC that are sort of floating
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:56.080]   around and then RASC that are bound to proteins the ELISA measures RASC bound to proteins and
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:03.680]   as you know ELISA is an antibody mediated detection assay the reason why we are able to generate
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:10.800]   antibodies to bound RASC is that when RASC bind to proteins they are antigens and form
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:17.840]   antibodies in some cases antibodies against self protein so the ELISA measures bound RASC
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:23.480]   and bound RASC generally accumulate over time which is why in the phase two A study over
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:30.500]   28 days we used the ELISA to assess RASC levels on the other end of the spectrum regarding
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:37.760]   one to two day or acute dosing of reproxelab we think that techniques such as LC and MASC
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:44.480]   might be more relevant to assessing RASC because there we would be looking at free RASC levels
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:52.440]   that would change acutely following dosing so somewhere within those two ranges of dosing
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:24:00.680]   paradigms and those two different assay techniques we will end up validating the precise technique
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:08.560]   and then establishing protocol design for the first of the RASC studies to begin shortly.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:17.360]   Okay great got it and maybe then you know how do you think about dosing regimens to be investigated
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.560]   and how you had conversations with the FDA on you know whether you'd have to do sort of
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:29.000]   QID or BID you know just to appreciate that you would be tapering and sort of the disease
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   state eventually.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.600]   Right and that gets back to the first part of your question how might the clinical community
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.880]   perceive duration of dosing and dosing regimens?
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:51.520]   First of all I think that signs of diseases including dry eye disease are primarily or
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.080]   first and foremost regulatory milestones.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   I do not believe that certainly in the case of dry eye disease that either physicians or
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.040]   patients are particularly worried about signs.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.520]   Patients do not wake up in the morning thinking I wonder what my Shermer test is I wonder
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:17.800]   what my corneal stain is and so forth instead we view signs and I think most patients and
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:25.880]   physicians use signs as regulatory milestones so the dosing paradigm for trials associated
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.800]   purely with signs I think is a lot less important.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:38.880]   In this case for one to two days dosing paradigm you're thinking of a limited number of doses
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:45.400]   for the 28 day dosing paradigm I would expect we would dose QID which is the first phase
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:51.080]   of our induction maintenance dosing paradigm which was established with the release of the
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:56.480]   phase 3 renew trial back in December.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.960]   In terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm for reproxelap in general in terms
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.340]   of treating patients I think that the induction maintenance paradigm established with renew
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:17.120]   over 12 weeks really sets the tone and more precisely the label for how the drug will be
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:26.600]   used and that is a QID dosing initially followed by BID dosing for the maintenance phase.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.880]   Okay that's really helpful.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.680]   Maybe just a clarification question I know in the press release it says that there's going
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:41.440]   to be a dry NDA filing by the end of next year is the current thinking still to continue
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.040]   on with a concurrent filing just you know I know later it says AC is also going to be
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:51.440]   found just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect them together still.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.120]   Our current thinking is that both will be filed together pending positive clinical data of
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:04.600]   course it turns out that the timeline for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis continue
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:14.320]   to overlap the safety studies the efficacy studies the timeline for filing the NDA all of those
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:22.480]   seem to overlap for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point which suggests that a concurrent
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.940]   NDA is perhaps the best regulatory strategy but of course we'll have to see how events
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.760]   play out over the latter part of this year and the early part of next year before we
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:40.040]   can guide specifically on the possibility of a concurrent NDA.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.840]   We really do like the concurrent NDA paradigm however because of the overlap between dry
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:52.000]   eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis there seems to be about a 50% overlap such that
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.320]   about half of the patients with dry eye disease complain of ocular itching and about half the
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:02.240]   patients with allergic conjunctivitis complain of dryness and a single compound that could
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:08.160]   treat both diseases or is indicated for both diseases would be highly advantageous not
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   only to physicians but also to patients as well.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.720]   Right, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:22.120]   Alex was just on the safety study is there an expectation for what the size and scope duration
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:27.240]   as well as number of patients you would anticipate for it?
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:36.280]   Right for dry eye disease my current understanding is that the FDA generally requires 100 patients
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:48.000]   complete one year of dosing however based on other sponsors interactions with the agency
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.080]   we believe that we can file based on six months of safety data.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:59.800]   So what happens is most sponsors will over enroll they'll begin with more than 100 patients
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:11.640]   such that they have 100 completers at 12 months and to our knowledge the safety trials are
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.680]   fairly standard and dry eye disease.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:24.440]   I will say as I mentioned in my prepared comments that we've tested well over 1000 patients we
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:32.720]   have seen no safety signals, no changes in intraocular pressure, no retinal findings,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:40.520]   no aberrant corneal findings or any other safety signals that would suggest that there has been
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.840]   an issue with reproxalap dosing in any patient that's received drugs so far.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:52.800]   Great, thanks again and I'll hop back in the queue.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.460]   And there are no further questions at this time we'll turn the call back over to Dr. Brady
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.960]   for closing remarks.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:06.440]   Well thank you all again for joining us today as always we look forward to keeping you updated
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   on our progress.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.440]   Have a nice day.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440]   Thank you.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.440]   Thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference call we thank you for your
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.960]   participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   >> Good morning and welcome to Earthstone Energy Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.140]   At this time, while participants are in a listen only mode,
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.720]   a brief question in the intersession will follow the formal presentation.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.100]   If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.340]   on your telephone keypad.
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.160]   As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.960]   Joining us today from Earthstone are Robert Anderson, President and Chief Executive Officer,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.800]   Mark Lumpkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.320]   and Scott Thielander, Vice President of Finance.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.240]   Mr. Thielander, you may begin.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.220]   >> Thank you and welcome to our second quarter conference call.
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.320]   Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.080]   statements within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.780]   and Section 21(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.160]   Although management believes these statements are based on reasonable expectations,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.520]   they can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.620]   These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions as described
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.280]   in the earnings announcement we released yesterday and in our 2019 annual report
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.140]   on Form 10(k) and subsequent quarterly filings.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.160]   These documents can be found in the investor section of our website, www.hearthstoneenergy.com.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.440]   Should one or more of these risks materialize or should underlying assumptions prove
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.820]   incorrect, actual results may vary materially.
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.280]   This conference call also includes references to certain non-gap financial measures
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.600]   which include adjusted diluted shares, adjusted EBIDACs, adjusted net income,
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.420]   all in cash costs, cash GNA and pre-cash flow.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.360]   Reconciliations of these non-gap financial measures
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.340]   to the most directly comparable measure under GAAP are contained
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.600]   in our earnings announcement released yesterday.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.420]   Also, please note information on this call speaks only as of today, August 6th, 2020.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.760]   Thus, any time sensitive information may no longer be accurate at the time
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.460]   of any replay or transcript reading.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.920]   A replay of today's call will be available via webcast by going
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.560]   to the investor section of Hearthstone's website and also by telephone replay.

[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.140]   on our earnings announcement released yesterday.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.740]   Today's call will begin with comments from Robert Anderson, our CEO followed
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.800]   by remarks from our CFO Mark Lumpkin regarding financial measures
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.520]   and financial matters and performance, and then some closing comments from Robert.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.920]   I'll now turn the call over to Robert.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.020]   >> Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.300]   and appreciate everyone's attendance for our call today.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.080]   Thanks for making time to join us for our second quarter conference call.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.320]   In the midst of the current pandemic, we continue to take appropriate caution
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.460]   and maintain focus on keeping our personnel safe while continuing
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.820]   to efficiently manage our operations.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.260]   Achieving our strong second quarter results in the face
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.000]   of this unprecedented oil price collapse and difficult operating environment is evidence
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.360]   of the resiliency of our business plan and the solid commitment of our people.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.940]   Throughout these trying times, we have worked to quickly adjust
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.000]   to the rapidly changing conditions and align our costs with our business activity
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.840]   as well as preserve our strengths.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.120]   As we have discussed last quarter and in updates along the way stating we would be free cash flow
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.620]   positive from the second quarter on for 2020,
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.080]   we had significant free cash flow of $35 million in this quarter.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.960]   This was driven by several factors including limited capital expenditures in the quarter
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.180]   as we completed our drilling and completion program for the year, strong hedge position
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.200]   that delivered over $29 million of realizations and significantly lower operating costs partially
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.860]   as a result of our may shut in and containment program, but also sustainable reductions.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.420]   Including the impact of our shut in program, our average daily sales volume
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.920]   in the second quarter was 13,555 barrels of oil equivalent or BOE per day.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.200]   Even with reduced volumes and a 44% drop in average realized price per BOE
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.920]   in the second quarter, our cost management efforts combined
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.840]   with the strong hedge position allowed us to generate higher quarter over quarter adjusted
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.880]   net income and adjusted EBITACs.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.040]   I suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.260]   We expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the balance
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.240]   of the year which should result in a decreasing debt balance and help us achieve our target
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.320]   of being below one times debt to EBITACs for the year.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.880]   As we previously discussed in response to the sharp decline in oil prices in April
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.620]   and very low forecasted May oil prices, we made the decision in late April
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.500]   to shut in the large majority of our operated production for the month of May
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.580]   which resulted in approximately 60% of our total net production being shut in during May.
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.160]   With a forecast of significantly improved June oil prices which ultimately were more
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.200]   than double our April and May oil price realizations,
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.120]   we returned to full production in June.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.780]   We had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.860]   which saw us reduce total lease operating expense or LOE in the second quarter
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.900]   by 40% from the prior quarter.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.380]   Despite reduced production volumes due to our shut in program in May,
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.440]   our teams continued focused on cost reductions, resulted in a 30% decrease in LOE per BOE
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.880]   in the second quarter to $4.53 versus $6.51 in the first quarter.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.020]   This was the major driver of the overall 33% reduction in all-in cash cost during the quarter.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.960]   On a per unit basis, our all-in cash cost went from near $13 per BOE
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.940]   in the first quarter to near $10 per BOE in the second quarter
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.440]   for a total 22% reduction.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.220]   This is all-in cash cost folks which includes operating costs, corporate GNA costs
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.220]   and all of our interest costs on our debt.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.080]   To dive a little deeper into how we achieve the 40% decrease in LOE,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.320]   let me outline some of the key factors.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.280]   First, as much of our peers have done, we were successful
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.780]   in negotiating price reductions with vendors across the broad range
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.260]   of our lease operating expenses, from chemicals to maintenance rigs,
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.020]   saltwater disposal contracts and compression costs.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.220]   Second, we are benefiting from our long-term practice
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.000]   of spending a little more money as we go repairing wells, facilities
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.380]   and associated equipment to reduce frequency of maintenance which is resulting
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.320]   in a continued decrease in non-routine LOE repair needs.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.320]   Third, workover repairs have trended down resulting from our optimization
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.920]   of lift method, chemical program improvements and general approach
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.120]   of fixing things right the first time.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.400]   The limited offset frack activity also reduced frack hit related workover expenses.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.780]   Fourth, we have been successful in getting the utility companies
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.660]   to perform electrical upgrades sooner than scheduled which has allowed us
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.640]   to eliminate generator usage on some of our newer locations.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.960]   Lastly, with limited drilling and completion activity,
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.200]   we have also been able to refocus our field employees towards lease maintenance
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.880]   which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.380]   All of these items and many other subtleties of operating were in progress
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.100]   as our team has a history of continually driving down costs.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.780]   We will remain focused on continuing to reduce cost across the board
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:24.400]   as we expect the oil price environment that we have observed since late 2014 including
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.340]   increased volatility to persist which only stresses the need to structure our business
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.800]   to be profitable across a much lower oil price range.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.700]   I'd really like to commend our operations team which did a fantastic job
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.760]   of both shutting in production in May and bringing production back fully online
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.400]   in June while also achieving these cost reductions.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.000]   For the first time in my career and our team's history,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.740]   we had to tell our guys to produce as little as possible every single day.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.620]   We executed this shut in operations and our field personnel did a great job
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.740]   of efficiently returning wells to production with little
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.260]   to no incremental expense and no adverse effects on our producers.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.280]   Our wells have returned to their previous volumes with some wells producing
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.000]   at increased rates for a period of time.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.820]   Plus the three wells in southeast Reagan County that were brought online
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.540]   in April prior to the curtailment and were shut in during May are now back online
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.060]   and have fully cleaned up and are performing well versus the tight curve.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.620]   I mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in late May
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.220]   and released our contracted rig operating in the Midland Basin.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:41.720]   So our planned capital expenditures are minimal for the balance of the year given
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.240]   that our program ended with 11 wells drilled but not completed and with our ample liquidity,
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.580]   we have optionality on completion timing depending on market conditions.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.340]   With production return to full capacity, we have entered the second half of this year
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.300]   with expectations for no further drilling or completion activity this year.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:07.060]   We can maintain approximately flat year over year production in 2020 compared to 2019.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.740]   As a reminder, we recently updated our 2020 full year production guidance ranging
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:19.340]   from 13,000 to 14,000 BOE per day which compares to 2019 full year average
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.400]   of 13,429 BOE per day.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.260]   Further, with our 11 drilled but uncompleted wells in Upton County,
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.440]   we intend to carefully monitor commodity pricing, appropriate service availability
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.420]   and service cost conditions to determine if it makes sense to bring
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.080]   in a completion crew later this year or wait until early next year.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.820]   Depending on the timing, we anticipate the completion
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.520]   of those 11 wells would enable us to maintain similar year over year production
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.380]   for 2021 with only a modest capital program for the completions
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.540]   which we currently estimate at around 30 million dollars.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.960]   With that overview, I'll now turn the call over to Mark to review the financials.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.060]   >> Have at it Mark.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.160]   >> Thank you Robert.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.280]   As we have in the past two consecutive quarters, I'd like to first discuss our cash position
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.440]   and our balance sheet.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.520]   As Robert mentioned, we are pleased to have achieved our goal
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.940]   of generating substantial pre-cash flow in the quarter with a total
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.140]   of 35.1 million in our pre-cash flow.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.360]   As we represent our first quarter call, our plan was first to reduce our working capital deficit
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.640]   which we calculate excluding derivatives and we're able to do this by a little over 50 million
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.500]   dollars during the second quarter and then to begin to pay down our revolver debt.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:38.200]   The borrow base under our senior secure revolving facility which was set in late March remains
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.800]   unchanged at 275 million dollars and should remain there
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.680]   and so our regularly scheduled fall redetermination process.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.780]   Our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:53.520]   at quarter end hold 168.6 million and we had 1.8 million in cash.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.560]   With 106.4 million of unused borrowing capacity,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.800]   that gave us approximately 108 million of liquidity quarter end.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.120]   I would note that as of July 31st, we had paid down our revolver
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.260]   by 14.3 million dollars compared to quarter end, reducing our debt balance now
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:16.360]   to about 154.3 million and we did expect to apply pre-cash flow
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.320]   the remainder of the year primarily to pay down the revolver.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   During the second quarter, our capital expenditures settled 3.2 million dollars
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.160]   and year to date we have spent 45 million dollars of our annual 2020 capital budget
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.960]   of 50 to 60 million dollars. As Robert mentioned, we concluded our 2020 drilling program in May
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.220]   so we anticipate minimal expenditures during the remainder of the year and will likely end
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.160]   up toward the low end of our guidance range.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.260]   Now looking at our second quarter income statement, starting with the top line revenue
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.320]   for the second quarter of 2020 were 21.7 million dollars compared
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.360]   to 45.1 million in the first quarter.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.880]   The decline was driven by a 54% decrease in oil revenues to 18.9 million dollars
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.120]   which made up about 87% of total revenues and the NGL revenues fell
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.540]   by 44% while natural gas revenues rose slightly.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.560]   Our average price in the second quarter for all three commodities was 17 dollars
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.960]   and 56 cents per barrel of oil equivalent which was down by nearly half
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.780]   of our average price during the first quarter.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.300]   By commodity, our average price for crude oil in the second quarter was 23 dollars
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:27.880]   and 56 cents per barrel, natural gas average 83 cents per MCF and NGL average 8 dollars
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.320]   and 10 cents per barrel of oil equivalent.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:38.560]   For our production standpoint, our second quarter sales volumes averaged 13,555 barrels
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:44.120]   of oil equivalent per day which was comprised of 65% oil, 18% natural gas
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.080]   and 17% natural gas liquids.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.680]   As highlighted, this does include having curtailed about 60% of total production in May.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:57.320]   On the expense side, as Robert also highlighted, we did drive down our all impact cost
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.260]   from 12.92 per B.O.E. in the first quarter to 10 dollars and 11 cents per B.O.E.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.140]   in the second quarter.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.760]   We achieved this through nearly $2 per B.O.E. reduction
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.900]   in our least operating expense to $4.52 per B.O.E. for the quarter.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:16.800]   On the general administrative side, we reduced our absolute tax GNA expense
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.100]   by about 7% versus the first quarter, which resulted in per unit tax GNA expense
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:29.500]   of $3.34 per B.O.E. As you know, we reduced our tax GNA guidance in May to $15.5
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.440]   to $16.5 million for the full year and expect to be somewhere in that range
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.400]   which at the bottom end is a 25% reduction versus our initial full year plan.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.880]   In addition to some of the savings we articulated last quarter, we continue to focus
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.800]   on and have had success in reducing expenses really anywhere including reduced uses
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.300]   of third party consultants reducing vendor rates and managing our costs tightly.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:58.620]   From an income standpoint, we reported GAT net loss in the second quarter
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:04.640]   of $35.9 million or 55 cents per share, which included a pre-taxed unrealized loss
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.480]   of $50 million on our derivative contracts.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.900]   Our adjusted net income was $12.8 million or 20 cents per diluted share,
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.080]   adjustable diluted share for the second quarter.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.120]   We reported adjusted EBITACs of $39.8 million in the second quarter,
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.020]   which as Robert mentioned is actually an increased quarter per quarter.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.920]   Now let's take a minute to update you on our commodity hedges results in the second quarter.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.980]   As highlighted, we realized $29.4 million are gained on our commodity hedges for the quarter.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.240]   This is largely reflective of our hedge position entering the quarter
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.340]   and are locking in some really nice gains on hedges when we made the decision
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.340]   to Grekel production and did that when second quarter NIMEX prices were about
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.060]   up to the lowest point.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:49.240]   The hedging realizations also include a gain of about $5.7 million from an unwind
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.940]   of 1,000 barrels of oil a day for the second half of 2020.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.760]   We remained really well hedged for the balance of the year with an average
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:03.180]   of 6,500 barrels per day of oil swapped at a NIMEX price of $58.35 stepping
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:09.640]   down to 4,000 barrels a day for four year 2021 at an NIMEX price of $55.16 per barrel
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.440]   with basis hedges in place on similar volumes.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:19.080]   On the natural gas side, we have 7,000 MMBTU per day, swaps at a Henry hub price
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:26.720]   of $2.85 for the second half of this year stepping up to 8,000 MMBTUs per day at a price
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:33.020]   of $2.71 for four year 2021 with basis hedges in place on the same volumes.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.120]   Hedging remains a critical component of our financial strategy and we expect to continue layering
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.980]   on hedges as we get more visibility around the resumption of our drill
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.580]   and completion activity going forward.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:50.280]   Stepping back and looking at our expectation for full year 2020, we reinstated our production guidance
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.300]   in July and we've reinstated LLE in production and Avalor and tax guidance
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.780]   with our earnings released yesterday.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:04.400]   Our reinstated production and Avalor and tax guidance of 6.25% to 7.25% is identical
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.840]   to what it was at the onset of our 2020 guidance provided in January as is the case
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.740]   for our reinstated LLE guidance of $550 to $6 for BOE.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.960]   Although we have had recent sustainable LLE reductions and came in well below this range
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.560]   in the second quarter, without the advantage of bringing on new wells we have kept our guidance range
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.460]   where it was at the end of the year when we anticipated bringing 16 new wells online.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.240]   >> With that I'll turn it back over to Robert.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.520]   >> Thank you, Mark.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.880]   We are really pleased with the results and confident in a bright future for Erstown.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.880]   While we are sorry to see our industry in such distress,
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.820]   it is creating more M&A opportunities than we have seen in quite some time.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.520]   We are actively evaluating a number of situations and expect to have more
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.120]   to consider throughout the rest of the year as prices remain low
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.760]   and distress situations continue to increase.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.400]   We believe that our strong balance sheet and track record as a successful consolidator positions
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.720]   us well to increase the scale of our company and add value to our shareholders.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.540]   With that operator we'll now open the floor for questions.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.660]   >> Thank you.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.380]   At this time we'll be conducting a question and answer session.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.200]   If you'd like to ask a question please press start on on your telephone keypad.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.480]   A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.320]   You may press start too if you'd like to remove your question from the queue.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.700]   For participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.020]   up your handset before pressing the star keys.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:34.640]   Our first question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.960]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.540]   >> Hi morning everyone.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.440]   Hope you're doing well.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.800]   I guess on the 2021 color that you gave about being able to keep production flat
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:51.160]   with the 11 ducks, is that more just meant to be instructive or is that actually how you're thinking
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.660]   about the 2021 plan as we fit here today?
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:00.020]   >> Yes. A little bit of both Brad.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:07.480]   You know it does depend on where commodity prices head towards the end of the year
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.160]   whether we want to pick up a rig or not.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:17.560]   I think we've been pretty vocal or consistent about our message that we need mid 45 to $50
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:26.020]   or oil to want to go back to spending large capital dollars but outside of that at some point
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.020]   into this year early next year completing those wells will allow us
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.200]   to main production flat year over year.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.960]   >> Okay good and then obviously you made a comment on M&A.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.200]   Can you go into a little more detail about sort of what opportunities you're seeing
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.220]   and also any thoughts you have about an ability to fund them?
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:59.720]   >> The opportunities are increasing and size is variable from small to quite large
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.440]   as you've seen you know distressed and bankrupt companies.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:10.540]   I think all of this will result in further opportunities in terms
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:18.840]   of larger companies selling assets it is difficult with no public equity
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:25.480]   and for that matter debt markets open or open only to a very few maybe we're one
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.280]   of those few but we've had discussions with financial parties who are interested
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:37.080]   in participating with us on acquisitions and much like we've done in our history you know
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.880]   we'll bring in parties at the right time to look at buying assets and we're going
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:49.560]   to maintain a very healthy leverage amount and keep ourselves from getting
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:56.560]   into a distress no matter where we are in the cycle so I think we're just going
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.960]   to see more and more opportunities and we'll figure out how we can finance those
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.840]   and make sure we keep our balance sheet clean.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:09.600]   >> Okay thanks for the comments.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.560]   >> Thank you our next question comes from the line of Neil Dingman with true security
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.920]   please proceed with your question.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.760]   >> Good morning all Robert first question also on that same line on 21 expectations
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.120]   and I'm just wondering you know why I realized this plan really I think you know
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.160]   at least the ones you just initial laid out as soon as no new wells really what's wondering
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:34.240]   what's driving this low cost or another way maybe ask is how you think about maintenance
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.540]   cap X you know given just so low because you know if I recall I thought Frank already had
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:46.360]   you all cancel those country club and other memberships I just know what else is there.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.800]   >> Yes there's no country club memberships up here.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:22:01.120]   >> You know the 11 wells we have are in really good areas and they they will help us keep production
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:08.120]   relatively flat at 30 million dollars now is that sustainable absolutely not you know we
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.800]   still have a relatively high decline rate and it does depend on when we brought those wells
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.640]   online if we waited until the very end of 21 we're going to have a hard time keeping production
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:25.060]   relatively flat if we brought them on today you know we might have the same problem because
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:33.080]   we get all this flush production from these new wells so you know maintenance but to maintain
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:39.320]   you know 13000 BoE a day kind of level longer term we're going to have to have a rig running
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:45.800]   and a one rig program I don't know what it would exactly cost us today but generally speaking
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:51.780]   is 120 million to maybe 140 million depending on lateral length and working interest and things
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.840]   like that so you know this is just a very preliminary if the world stays the same and
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:04.480]   we're at 40ish low $40 environment we're not staying drilling capital these 11 ducks will
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.280]   help us keep production flat.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.920]   >> Okay and then you kind of hit on my last one just on how do you think about sort of
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:19.740]   PDP decline you know on a go forward is now that you've been slowing a bit is that that
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:25.720]   to you know going to go down or I guess look at another way is it you know you're able
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.560]   to give us kind of how many how many wells would offset that I mean in any way you can
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.740]   kind of give us a caller on how you know kind of you're thinking about that in 21 on broader
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:44.120]   terms. >> Yeah I think we've been consistent in telling everyone that our sort of basic
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:50.200]   line starting today we'll call it you know is about 30% in the first year and then it
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:57.640]   gets into the mid maybe 26 or 27% the next year and then low 20s or high teens after
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:05.700]   that and so you know I don't think that's changed any and if we didn't spend any capital then
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:13.500]   you can kind of forecast what our low down production would look like even if we didn't
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:19.480]   do those 11 wells but again with those 11 wells it'll help keep 21 flat and then going
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.940]   forward in 22 and beyond it's all going to depend on price.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:31.560]   >> Very good. Thank you. >> Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Jeff
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.260]   Graham with Northland Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:43.180]   >> I guess I was wondering Robert or maybe Mark how important do you guys do you think
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:49.020]   precast flow positive in the context of evaluating you know whether to go after this adeption
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.260]   and potentially drilling or I guess some point in time but would you view that as kind
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:58.940]   of a you know a must if you will or would you guys have any level of comfort with any you
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:05.100]   know near medium term outstanding if it helped you know if the returns were good and it would
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.580]   help start a return to growth. >> Sure maybe I'll try to answer that one
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:15.020]   then Robert can add on if he wants to. You know we keep things pretty simple at the end
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.920]   of the day we feel like our responsibility is to make good individual decisions at the
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:26.940]   wellhead and that's why we were quick to put the rig down and stop completing in March and
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.620]   April is because the economics didn't make a whole lot of sense then did the ducks make
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.820]   sense right now. I mean economically you definitely could go complete the ducks right
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:44.460]   now and have pretty nice IRR's for the incremental cost to complete them in terms of are we so
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:50.140]   focused on quarter to quarter year to year pre cash flow that we won't out spend. No we're
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:55.340]   not and from a practical matter and we're just going to be pre cash flow positive this year
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:00.460]   and next year kind of irrespective of anything else that happens with prices if all we're
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:06.140]   doing is completing the ducks. At some point you know we do anticipate picking the rig
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:12.100]   back up and you know there's a bit of it obviously a lag there between the cost you expend to
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:17.140]   drill in the complete wells versus the cash flow. You know does that mean over the course
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:22.460]   of the year we're not pre cash flow positive? No not necessarily but we're not so fixated
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:29.420]   on checking that box every quarter. We want to make smart economic decisions at the wellhead
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:35.380]   that will flow into the bigger picture and having some out spend for some period of time you
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:41.940]   know we still think is supported by the economics at the same time you know we're not ones just
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.820]   to go keep drilling and completing because we have hedges in place or for other reasons
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:52.220]   we're just trying to be as good a spirit as we can of the individual decisions we're making
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:58.940]   at the wellhead. Yeah the only thing I'll add Jeff is I think we can run a one rig program
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:05.100]   with the level of production and cash flow we have today and be cash flow neutral on an
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.260]   annualized basis. Obviously there's a jump starting the program we're going to be cash
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:18.020]   flow negative for a period of time but I think longer term over a year time frame. Again depending
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:25.380]   on what the price is. Sure understood appreciate those comments. My follow up and you guys still
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:32.300]   have you know a decent amount of non-off exposure in the Permian are you guys seeing any activity
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:39.340]   levels there and more on the land side is there any traction or conversations on swapping any
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:47.940]   of that out to increase the operation exposure there? Still working on the trades but people
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:53.780]   have been hunkered down in the bunker you know for quite some time now since you know at least
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:28:02.500]   March and so nothing's moving very quickly there. We have no we have not heard anything
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:09.720]   different from our partners in terms of activity in the near term being kind of the remainder
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.620]   of this year so we'll have to see as we get closer to year end what their view might be
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:25.700]   for activity in 2021. All right thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Duncan
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:33.980]   Macintosh with Johnson Wright. Please receive your question. Good morning Robert. I had a
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.020]   quick question over on the balance sheet you know you're doing great job in the free cash
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.300]   I looked great paying it down wondering you know if you've been in conversations with the bank as
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:48.060]   we head into the fall redetermination back in March you know we're early and getting it done in the
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:53.180]   spring but you know back in back then it looked like things would be pretty dire again in the fall
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:57.180]   and it's not as bad here and particularly with the line of sight y'all have on the free cash kind
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:03.020]   of how any conversations then to give you any indication as to what the fall redetermination
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:09.700]   could look like. Sure I mean probably too early to you know certainly anything around numbers
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:14.660]   but we do pretty rarely talk to banks and we we do that normal course irrespective of the
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:20.660]   environment. You know the one thing I can for us we are expecting a decrease in the barn base
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.780]   and you know obviously we're not drilling and completing new wells and hedges roll off you
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:31.460]   know fortunately we feel like we've got enough ability to pay down debt to outpace that decrease
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:38.060]   and really you know we don't see any scenarios that we think are realistic that would be concerning
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:44.260]   in that regard. Now I will say like does the environment feel better now than it did three
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:52.460]   months ago absolutely and maybe some of that's the shock of seeing minus 37 hour oil and you
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:59.620]   know teen realizations for the months of April and May. I think at the end of the day it's still
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:06.860]   not a very good price environment for companies in general and the banks maybe they feel a little
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:14.660]   better because work $45 or $42 versus somewhere in the teens but they still have a lot of issues
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:19.900]   to deal through to deal with it and obviously there's been a lot of EMP companies that have
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:25.700]   gone bankrupt and there's certainly more that will so the banks still have their hands full
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.620]   and they're still working through all these situations yeah I think there is a lot of trepidation
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:37.780]   from the banks part in general and yeah I don't frankly see them letting up a whole bunch
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:44.580]   in the fall no that being said that's a general statement yeah we've got one time leverage
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:51.060]   and liquidity and generally are viewed as having done the right thing from a financial standpoint
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:57.860]   and our assets are better than many we probably feel like we've got a pretty supportive bank
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:05.900]   group that is gonna be reasonable and fair and historically that's been the case but too
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:13.660]   early to circle a number. Thanks Mark and then I guess just for my followup you know Robert
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:19.500]   you gave some really good color on some pretty creative things to get LOE down in the second
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.060]   quarter I know you talked about how it's gonna come back up a little bit here in the back
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:28.060]   after the year towards you know a more historical range but you know any of those initiatives
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:33.420]   that you took do you think that you could carry forward to kind of help mitigate that
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:42.100]   LOE creep? Definitely done there's you know it's just a constant progression of a wells
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:50.700]   life cycle to adjust artificial list a lot of our wells are on gas lift so relatively
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:58.180]   expensive compressors over time that gets changed out to other lift methods in some cases rod
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:04.820]   pump and other cases plunger lift what have you so we're continuing to work through that
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:10.980]   and that will definitely help reduce LOE and then some of the things that you know we were
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:17.820]   fortunate in getting done in the quarter working with the utility company to get meters set
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:24.100]   and get ahead of the schedule there or got moved up in the schedule from some good relationships
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:30.620]   we we ended up getting generators off of our payroll and those are very very expensive so
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.780]   we didn't have a whole lot but they still show up as a big expense so some of these things
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.500]   we did in the second quarter are sustainable and we'll continue doing the right things
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:47.220]   and the way we you know operate our business and continue to watch costs like a hawk alright
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:53.940]   thank y'all very much and grab some strong order and a strong outlook thank you thanks
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.180]   down thank you ladies and gentlemen as reminder if you'd like to join the question queue please
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:04.140]   press star one on your telephone keypad our next question comes from line of Noel parks
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:14.580]   with coca and Palmer please proceed with your question hey good morning I know I um you
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:19.580]   know I was thinking about having the buck inventory that you know where it works out
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:25.980]   that just completing those next year giving can help you keep production flat that's you
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:33.060]   know that's a lot of really great flexibility you have there and I mean was that just sort
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:42.420]   of a result of the timing of everything you know kind of falling off the rails with with
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:50.380]   covid and overt Russia or or was um was that sort of part of the plan as you were just trying
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:59.300]   to you know continue to pivot to emphasis on free cash flow hitting it next year I'd love
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:04.180]   to tell you know that we had this great plan that no matter what happened in the world
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:11.300]   oil going to 20 or sub 20 that we could keep production flat for three years running with
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:16.100]   various amounts of capital if you go back and think about the beginning of the year and the
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:24.620]   call we had you know related to the fourth quarter earnings and full year we had a one rate program
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:32.400]   we were going to average for the entire year a tiny bit of free cash flow and those 11 wells
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.540]   would have been completed I don't know if by now I can't remember but pretty darn close
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:45.500]   though I'd say it's a fallout of what's happened here and just being very conservative with
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:54.580]   our capital expenditures and cash and making sure that you know we come out of this down
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:35:02.220]   this near term down cycle we've been in a down cycle since 2014 but at least this recent piece
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:08.740]   of it that we you know we survived nicely through it and come out the other side and continue
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:17.300]   to find ways to consolidate and grow great thanks and you know just a housekeeping question
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:24.780]   so if you touched on this earlier and I missed it for the free cash flow calculation if I
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:29.180]   looked at the numbers right it looked like this is one of those periods where there is a pretty
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:38.140]   big delta between I used to say cash capex and you know sort of capex incurred in the quarter
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:47.660]   and I was just wondering for the free cash flow calculation going forward there's just
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:53.540]   kind of which which which one of those is is more important for us to use as we you know
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:36:02.340]   just try to model that we always use a crude cash from a calculation standpoint because
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:09.660]   not all the bills necessarily have hit but we know what generally they are so okay it's
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:17.780]   in that presentation on the last page or something like that okay so so real oh and one of the
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:23.780]   things I am and I just don't have a release in front of me and as far as changing working
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:30.740]   capital you that's something also you would routinely include well include the impact
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:38.540]   of in a free cash calculation or would you exclude that yeah so we don't include that
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:44.420]   and I recognize there's you know multiple different ways to to look at that I mean the way we've
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:49.780]   been approaching it is okay adjusted EBITX is the best proxy for your really sort of cash
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:56.900]   flow for the period we back out interest expense and then we back out capital expenditures for
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:02.140]   activity during that period now when you're stopping or starting there is going to be a
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:07.580]   bigger delta between right accurate and pre cash flow the way we do versus if you're using
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:16.220]   a cash cap X number you know the second quarter was very typical from the standpoint of yeah
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:22.940]   here we're reporting 35 million of free cash flow yeah our debt balance went up and the
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:27.860]   reason for that is because and of course this is tied to the cash cap X it's just the time
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:33.620]   of the payments yeah we reduced the the negative working capital deficit by about 50 million
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:38.420]   during the quarter now we're to a point where that working deficit working capital deficit
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:44.380]   is pretty low and probably won't fluctuate a whole bunch one way or the other until we
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:51.740]   pick activity back up at which point you'd expect yeah you start completions and drilling
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.820]   again you start getting bills but there's some lag between the activity and when you get
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:01.860]   the bills and when you pay them so very typical quarter yeah as we mentioned the press release
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:07.580]   yeah we had about 169 million of debt at quarter end and the month of July we paid down a little
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:13.220]   more than 14 that's not the run rate by the way it's not 14 million quarter that was high
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:18.500]   because of timing but we do expect I mean really every month this year that we're paying down
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:26.440]   some debt without any big changes in the working capital status great thanks a lot for
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:33.260]   the details that's up for me thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.140]   answer session I'll turn the floor back to mr. Anderson for any final comments
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:44.380]   well we appreciate everybody joining us and you know we'll continue the update as as we
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:50.420]   need to and we'll see you next quarter thanks thank you this concludes today's conference
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.380]   you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.500]   you

[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.080]   with the SEC. With that, I will turn the call over to Adi.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   Adi?
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.400]   Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our second quarter
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.600]   business update call. Today we have some updates to share with you on our operational progress
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.640]   as well as on our financial results. While we're still in the middle of a serious global health
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.200]   pandemic and a challenging economic downturn and aftermath, we are quite confident that
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.080]   the steps we're taking in advancing our science and moving our pipeline forward are beginning
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.160]   to yield data that demonstrate the long-term potential of our innovative approaches and
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.700]   products. COVID-19 continues to affect societies around the world and we hope that you and your
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.000]   families are well and safe. We are observing some impact by COVID-19 on the progress of
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.320]   our clinical studies. However, it's at last and we're taking great efforts to minimize
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.160]   them. As a result, we have been able to continue our progress on the clinical studies of AFM-13
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:46.120]   in the referral Tysal lymphoma and of AFM-24 in each AFR positive tumors. And, which is
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:55.820]   very exciting for us, genetic dose, the first patient with RO729709, which, as you remember,
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.560]   is the BCMA/CD6DNA unit that's an NHL. We are also making good progress on our pre-clinical
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.880]   pipeline. For our lead candidate AFM-13, our study in patients who have relapsed or refractory
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.680]   peripheral Tysal lymphoma in exhausted available standard of care treatments are now being treated
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.320]   with AFM-13 as a single agent. We are executing according to our development timelines and,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:32.780]   as previously stated, expect to complete the pre-determined interim analysis in mid 2021.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.400]   We're also looking at options to enhance AFM-13's efficacy beyond monotherapy. The first of these
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.560]   options is the combination with allergen egg and K-cells in a study that is conducted
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.040]   at the MD Anderson Cancer Institute and on IST. MD Anderson website now shows that the
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.480]   study is enrolling, but the initiation is impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Texas.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.840]   A first patient in the study is expected as soon as this situation improves. For AFM-24,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.640]   we disclosed that we have completed the first cohort of our dose escalation study without
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:22.120]   any dose limiting toxicities. And we're currently recruiting into the second dose cohort. We
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.780]   have all four planned sites active and recruiting. Following the completion of the dose escalation
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.860]   phase of the study, we have the option to enroll patients into tumor specific expansion cohorts
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.720]   where we will look for single agent activity in a number of well defined tumor types. In
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.320]   addition, we're planning to initiate combination studies with checkpoint inhibitors. And we will
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:54.480]   be providing updates as the program continues to make progress. We're very pleased with the
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.600]   continued progress in our collaboration with the genetic. Importantly, the phase one clinical
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:07.160]   study with the BCMA/CD16A inhibitor and engager is now enrolling patients. This achievement
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.560]   represents the third inhibitor and engager to enter the clinic and triggers a milestone
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.840]   payment to us during the third quarter in an amount that we're not able to disclose.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.560]   Last month, Angus Smith joined us as chief financial officer. Angus will introduce himself
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.120]   later and discuss our financial position and the flexibility provides us to continue to
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:39.160]   execute on our strategy and drive future growth of our company. During the annual annual meeting
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:46.040]   of shareholders, which was held in August 4, we're happy to report that all proposed agenda
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.740]   items were approved. This includes the addition of Dr. Annalisa Jenkins and Harry Welton to
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:59.640]   the supervisor report as new members. Annalisa is a visionary leader who knows how to translate
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:05.840]   signs from bench to bedside. And Harry is an accomplished financial executive who will
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.240]   help drive value creating strategies for the company. These additions to the supervisor
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:19.520]   report further strengthen the company's industry knowhow, experience and diversity. As it has
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.560]   only been a month and a half since we last spoke to you, we thought we would focus today's discussion
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.000]   on company achievements thus far and what gives us confidence in our science. Update
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   you on our programs and allow plenty of time for Q&A. To get it, I will now hand over the
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.220]   call to Andreas Haastrik, our chief medical officer, to give you a brief update on our
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.120]   clinical stage programs. Andreas?
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:53.240]   Thank you, Adi, for the introduction and thank you all for joining us today and I'm happy
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:59.760]   to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs that we made over the last
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   three months. As you all aware, COVID-19 pandemic is still present globally and it continues
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:16.040]   to pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment of patients. The
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:23.520]   two guiding principles we are employing at AFIMED is to ensure patient safety on the studies
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.120]   and to ensure trial data integrity and this is in line, I think, with guidance given from
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:37.880]   all competent authorities. Within this framework, however, the AFIMED team is very proactively
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:44.960]   working with all of our participating sites to make sure that our innovative treatment is
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:52.700]   still available for patients in need of new therapeutics and that we minimize the impact
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:59.860]   of COVID-19 to a minimum possible. One important achievement in this regard is that we were
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:06.560]   able to secure drug supply for all of our ongoing studies and can ensure uninterrupted treatment
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:14.780]   of all patients. To go into more detail, let's start with AFM 13, our most advanced program
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:25.480]   first. As you know, AFM 13 is in a registration directed phase two study AFM 13 202 treating
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:33.240]   patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral T cell lymphomas who have exhausted all available
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:42.280]   standard of care options. The enrollment into the study is at a steady state. We were able
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:50.920]   to activate 54 sites now contributing patients in 10 countries around the globe.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:59.560]   As you know, this study has Simon two-stage design with a pre-planned interim analysis
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:07.440]   after 40 patients in the PTCL cohorts and as Adi said, we are confident that we will have
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:14.000]   the data from this interim analysis available by the middle of next year.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.720]   There was also a third cohort, or there is a third cohort in this study for patients with
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:27.000]   transformed mucosis fungoidis, so a cutaneous form of T cell lymphomas. This third cohort
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.680]   with mucosis fungoidis was never part and never intended to be part of the registration
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:40.160]   program. It was a proof of concept cohort only and for COVID 19 related restrictions,
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.040]   the enrollment into this cohort is currently on hold.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:50.680]   As Adi also mentioned, we are continuing to make progress in our collaboration with MD
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:59.000]   Anderson Cancer Center where we have an active IND for our first phase one study of AFM 13
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   combination with allergenic national killer cells. As Adi said, the current status at
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.040]   the MD Anderson webpage is recruiting and we know that our patients are currently screened
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.680]   and considered and we are expecting to the enrollment of the first patient as soon as
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:26.880]   COVID 19 related restrictions at MD Anderson are lift up.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:34.520]   Now let's move to our second program AFM 24. As you know, a biospecific tetravalent molecule
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:41.960]   targeting both CD16A to activate national killer cells and macrophages and the EGF receptor
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:52.080]   on solid tumors. This compound is in a phase one dose escalation part of the 101 study
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.960]   and we are happy to report that we were able to activate all four pre-planned sites and
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   all four pre-planned sites are contributing patients.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.160]   As we disclosed earlier, we have completed our cohort one without observing dose limiting
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:17.120]   toxicities and are actively recruiting into dose cohort two.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:23.960]   With this, I close the overview of the clinical progress and I'm happy to hand over to my
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:31.040]   colleague Arne Chotilius, Chief Scientific Officer who will review with you some of our pre-clinical
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:38.480]   data that make us so excited about the opportunities that we can create for patients with ICEs and
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.240]   activating the innate immune system. Arne please.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:51.720]   Thank you Andreas and thank you all for joining. In the next few minutes I would like to summarize
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.120]   as Andreas mentioned, the pre-clinical and clinical data observed so far with our innate
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:05.000]   cell engagers providing evidence that these molecules are potent and safe drug candidates.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.840]   I'll start by summarizing the data showing that our ICEs are potent molecules. As you
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:22.760]   see on slide five, if we take AFM 13 as an example, AFM 13 has been shown strong single
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:31.640]   agent anti-tumor responses and T-cell lymphoma with an overall response rate of 50%. The molecule
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:38.280]   has also shown promising signs of broad clinical development potential in augmenting other
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:46.240]   IO therapies such as PD1 inhibitors. For example, in the Hodgkin lymphoma phase 1B study we've
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:53.200]   seen an impressive overall response rate of 88% with a complete response rate of 42%
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:03.040]   and 46% in the local and the central read respectively. In the low part of the slide we've also highlighted
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:12.400]   for you presentations of the studies past and in the future. Additionally our own experience
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:19.280]   and the work with Andy Anderson we have seen promising pre-clinical data showing that
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.280]   the combination with the adoptive transfer of NK cells enhanced the immune response of
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:32.600]   AFM 13 leading to prolonged survival in the respective mouse model and as we mentioned
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:40.000]   the phase 1B study of Andy Anderson is now in the last stages of preparation.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.360]   If we go to slide six, you see that in our pre-clinical studies with AFM 24 we saw potent
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:56.960]   killing of EGFR positive tumor cell lines mediated by two distinctive mechanisms of action.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:04.760]   Potent ADCC or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity is seen irrespective of the
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:13.480]   mutational status of the tumor cells and we see potent killing mediated by ADCP or antibody
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:21.800]   dependent cellular phagocytosis in tumor cells with high and low EGFR expression. Importantly
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:31.020]   in cells bearing the KRAS G13D mutation AFM 24 shows preserved killing, potent killing
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:40.280]   for ADCP or phagocytosis whereas this ability is lost for established treatments. For the
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:51.560]   anti BCMA CD16 or RO729 formerly known as AFM 26 molecule we also saw very good potency
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:16:03.120]   in synomunkies whereas a dose dependent killing of BCMA positive plasma cells was observed.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:09.160]   We believe that the observed improved potency is mediated by the dual mode of action of
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:16.180]   AFM 24 approach. The NAID cell engagers are employing NK cells and macrophages to kill
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:24.600]   tumor cells and thus act via a two-prong mode of action of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:32.120]   and antibody dependent phagocytosis to fight cancer. Indeed this dual mode of action is
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:38.800]   differentiated from other NAID cell targeted approaches as these specifically activate
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:48.360]   NK cells only. RNAID cell engagers work at low expression levels. The potency is thus
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:56.720]   independent of the surface target expression and you see this we continue in slide 6 with
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:03.400]   AFM 13 we learned that there is a broad range of cell lines that express different levels
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:10.320]   of tumor antigen and we have not observed any dependency of target expression to the potency
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:18.840]   of the molecule. The same holds true for AFM 24 and the anti BCMA engagers. Preclinically
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:27.560]   both molecules have shown high potency across a wide range of EGFR and BCMA surface expression
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:34.720]   including at low target expression levels. This implies that more patients could respond
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:43.160]   to treatment with an NAID cell engager versus an antibody drug conjugate or ADC as the mechanism
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:51.440]   of ADCs have been shown only to rely on certain levels of target antigen thereby missing those
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:18:00.440]   tumor cells with expression levels below the ability of the ADC to bind two target cells.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:08.640]   As we move on to slide 7 and report on the safety front preclinically our NAID cell engagers
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:17.400]   demonstrate low cytokine release. Some examples of this are the ID enabling toxicology study
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:24.840]   in synomologous monkeys which consistently showed no meaningful increases in serum cytokines.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:31.160]   For example at the June virtual ACR conference a preclinical poster presentation on the RO
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:38.560]   729 molecule with genetic showed potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing NK cells
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:45.480]   as effector cells with minimal increase in cytokines. Also a four week safety study in
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:51.960]   synomonkeys showed a favorable safety profile with no cytokine release or adverse findings
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:19:04.040]   at the 1515 and 5050 mixed per kick tested dose levels and in the case of AFN24 only a transient
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:11.640]   increase in RO 6 was observed that was fully reversible within 24 hours but no signs of
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.960]   cytokine release was observed that would lead one to believe that there is a risk of a cytokine
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:25.680]   storm in patients. Important to note here is that none of the clinical studies of AFN13
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.800]   have revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines. These data indicate that
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:41.040]   our ICs have a tolerable and good safety profile. Taken altogether these data suggest that our
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.720]   innate cell engages are potent, able to engage at low levels of antigen expression and have
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:55.080]   thus far demonstrated a good and tolerable safety profile. Now in order to maximize the
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:01.520]   opportunity for molecules in addition to clinical development as monotherapies we are also
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.200]   pursuing combinations with natural killer cells and other treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:16.400]   such as PD1 and PDL1. We go to slide 8 and first let me comment on our combination approach
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.920]   with NK cells. As you see on the slide there is evidence showing that high NK cell numbers
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:30.680]   are associated with better outcomes. For example, patients with metastatic coutaneous melanoma
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:38.160]   have improved survival rates if their tumors show evidence of NK cell infiltration. We
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.520]   also know that patients with diffuse large B cell and follicular lymphomas treated with
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:55.560]   NDCD20 antibodies that have low peripheral NK counts tend to have poor survival. We are
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:01.860]   seeing that one of the limitations in treating patients is that they don't have the appropriate
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:11.320]   amount of NK cells. So we are working on supplementing NK cells through adaptive transfer and are
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:20.000]   currently assessing different approaches as you can see on slide 9. As we go to slide 10
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.660]   as discussed earlier, the improved tumor cell killing by loading NK cells with our ICEs
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:35.160]   as you see on the graph for in vitro data on the right hand side of slide 10. It will be
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:41.760]   investigated in the MD Anderson phase 1 study in CD30 positive recurrent or refractory Hodgkin
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:49.220]   non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The preclinical data that we share here and have shared before
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:56.160]   leads us to believe that we can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy of an innate
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:04.820]   cell engager AFM13 through the addition of NK cells. And encouraged by the synergistic
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:12.500]   potential of combining our ICEs with NK cells and checkpoint inhibitors, we are currently
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:19.320]   evaluating the opportunity on our developing clinical plans for these combinations with
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:27.360]   AFM24. Finally, let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at ASER. As a
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:34.600]   reminder, our AFM24 poster demonstrated its distinct mechanism of action different from
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:43.280]   other EGFR signaling inhibition approaches potentially able to provide benefit to broad
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:50.320]   range of cancer patients. And in the case of the joint poster with genetic, the preclinical
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:57.800]   pharmacology and safety of the BCNA/CD60NA innate cell engager shows potent cell killing
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:04.400]   in tumor cell lines, employing NK cells as effector cells, minimal increase in cytokines
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:11.360]   suggesting a low risk of cytokine release syndrome. We hope this background was helpful
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:17.840]   for you and I will now turn the call over to Angus to introduce himself and provide an
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:38.240]   update on the financials. Thanks.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.680]   Turning to the results for the quarter, happy med consolidated financial statements have
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.960]   been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standard
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:54.960]   Board for IASB. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:01.080]   the company's functional and presentation currency. Therefore, all financial numbers that
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:07.840]   I will present in this call unless otherwise noted will be in Euros. We ended the second
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:14.320]   quarter with cash, cash equivalence and current financial assets of 92.6 million Euros compared
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:22.280]   to 104.1 million Euros on December 31, 2019. During the quarter, we received net proceeds
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:29.240]   of approximately 20.8 million Euros under our asset market for ATM program. Based on our
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:35.320]   current operating plan and assumptions, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalence
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:42.600]   and current financial assets will support operations into the first half of 2022. Net cash use and
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.640]   operating activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 with 15 million Euros compared
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:55.600]   to 5.6 million Euros in the second quarter of 2019. The second quarter 2019 net cash use
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.200]   and operating activities included a milestone payment to the company from the Genentech
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:07.640]   Collaboration. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was 2.9 million Euros compared
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:14.360]   with 4 million Euros in the second quarter of 2019. Revenue in 2020 and 2019 predominantly
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.120]   relates to the Genentech Collaboration. Revenue from the Genentech Collaboration in the second
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:25.240]   quarter 2020 was comprised of revenue recognized for collaborative research services performed
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:32.520]   during the quarter. R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 11.7 million Euros compared
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:39.240]   to 11.5 million Euros in the second quarter of 2019. Expenses in 2020 relate predominantly
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:45.280]   to our AFM 13 and AFM 24 clinical programs as well as to our early stage development and
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:52.880]   discovery activities. G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 2.6 million Euros compared
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:59.160]   to 2.3 million Euros in the second quarter of 2019. The increase is primarily related to
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:05.680]   higher SOX compliance costs, legal consulting and audit costs. Net loss for the second quarter
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:13.840]   of 2020 was 12.2 million Euros or 16 cents per common share of 10.3 million Euros or 17
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.840]   cents per common share during the second quarter of 2019. The weighted number of common shares
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:26.520]   outstanding for the quarter ended June 30th 2020 were 79.2 million. I will now turn the
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:37.640]   call back to Adi. Thank you Angus. As you can see from our presentation today, we're taking
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:44.200]   advantage of the knowledge that we've gained in the field of innate immunity and are applying
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:52.400]   it to our programs going forward. This experience in working with the innate immune system is
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:59.080]   something that we have uniquely established at AFMET and is helping us in guiding the design
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:07.040]   of unique therapies which now have the potential to address very different kinds of cancers.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:14.440]   I just want to point out here that the EGFR is expressed in more than 10 tumors and that
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:23.480]   gives us a lot of optionality how to take this molecule forward. We are pleased with how
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:28.080]   things are moving forward for both our clinical and preclinical programs especially in the
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:36.320]   current environment. Our preclinical programs are on track from 13 and 24 are moving forward
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.560]   according to plan and Chinanthig is moving things forward with the anti-PCMA/CD6NA in
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:51.760]   SL Engager. What are our inflection points for the next one and a half years for AFM 13?
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:59.200]   We've mentioned that we want to present the interim data in peripheral T cell lymphoma
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:07.760]   around middle of next year. We've been successful in our collaboration with MD Anderson moving
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:16.920]   forward the combination of AFM 13 and co-plugged derived natural killer cells. As we said we
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.600]   are ready to start. Our MD Anderson is ready to start and we hope to report for his patient
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:29.640]   then and we will provide updates as we move forward. For AFM 24 we are in the midst of
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:36.920]   dose escalation in order to generate safety and activity data. This is quite exciting
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:45.480]   for us because it's a drug with a very differentiated profile as compared to the other moieties
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:53.440]   currently used in targeting EGF receptor. Now with the dose escalation and establishing
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.760]   the safety we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.980]   the dose cohort expansion but as we've mentioned earlier is also planning early on to move forward
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:15.000]   into combinations. We're very happy with the progress in the Chinanthig collaboration. We've
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.800]   just provided the next update for the BCMA CD16A in-gager. We have multiple other programs
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:30.000]   ongoing and if things go well pending on program progression we can bring in additional milestone.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:38.980]   And for our newest additions to the pipeline with AFM 28 and AFM 32 we are starting behind
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:46.780]   enabling studies so that we can have an ID filing first for AFM 28. Finally before we
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:52.600]   open the session for Q&A I would like to thank all our employees for their contribution and
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:59.100]   express our gratitude, my gratitude in particular for our investigators and the clinical sites,
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:04.800]   the patients and all their families and our investors who are supporting us in our efforts
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:11.460]   to develop these innovative treatments for cancer patients. It is through the combined
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:18.480]   efforts of all of you that keeps us on the path of discovery and innovation. I'm now happy
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.740]   to close the presentation and we're open now for questions. Thank you.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:29.240]   Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session as a reminder should be
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.760]   fair as a question. You will need to press star and the number one on the telephone ring
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.920]   coming to the house. If you wish to cancel it then press the pound or hash key. Once again
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:45.440]   it's star and one for questions. First question comes from the line of Maui Raykhoff from
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.360]   Jeffrey please go ahead. Your line is now open.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:56.540]   Hi good morning everyone. That's under progress and thanks for taking my questions. To start
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:02.120]   off just wondering for AFM 24, I'm not sure how much you can say on this but just wondering
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:09.560]   if both patients in core two have been dosed and if you can talk more about the timing
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:14.660]   of dosing between patients and what the foresight activated can you provide any more perspective
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:20.960]   about enrollment pace going forward. Andreas can you take the question please?
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:27.720]   Yeah so there were multiple parts to the questions and I hope I got them all. So the phase one
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:36.480]   study of AFM 24, as we said we are recruiting in the second cohort. We have not yet disclosed
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:45.800]   how many patients, as you know it's a standard three by three design with a Bayesian dose
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:54.000]   modification but that's basically what it is. In terms of timing between the patients
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.340]   there is a mandatory eight day waiting period between patients so they cannot be treated
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:07.940]   all at the same time but will be staggered with eight day intervals. And there was another
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:13.180]   part of the question around the four participating sites.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:18.580]   Right, yeah just wondering if you can provide any more perspective about enrollment pace
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:25.880]   going forward. Yeah currently the enrollment pace is as pre-spressified by the protocol
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:33.000]   so all sites are very active in screening patients and as we said all sites have already
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:43.140]   contributed patients. Got it, okay great. And then also for AFM 24 just checking
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:48.280]   if you can say more about the tumor types that you're screening for the study and if
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.000]   you can also provide more perspective into the checkpoint inhibitor and combo plans
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:04.880]   at this point. So for the tumor types in the dose escalation part we are accepting all
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:13.320]   our patients with all histologies that our EJFR are expressing and whereas a patient has
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:20.320]   exhausted the respective standard of care treatments. As Adi mentioned this is a wide variety
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:27.000]   of potential tumors, probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal camps
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.040]   and non small cell lung camps and these are the two histologies where we would expect
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:40.220]   probably the majority of patients in the phase one having said that the dose escalation part
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:47.280]   would also be open for other EJFR expressing tumors like for example head and neck cancer
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:55.920]   gastric cancer or other solid tumors. Now once we have defined our dose limiting toxicities
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.600]   or if there are no dose limiting toxicities we have defined the recommended phase two
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:10.360]   dose we will enroll into tumor specific expansion cohorts and these expansion cohorts are currently
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:20.000]   in the process of being defined. Now for our PD1 combination plans based on the interesting
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:28.680]   data we have seen with PD1 in combination with AFM 13 which aren't referred to with a very
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:35.920]   encouraging complete response rate in excess of 40 percent we plan to have a combination
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:46.560]   with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor open rather soon probably in parallel to the last cohorts of
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.000]   the dose escalation of the single agent studies so it will be more or less a parallel development
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:07.840]   that we are anticipating right now. Great, thanks for the additional perspective. Any follow-up
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:15.960]   questions? We will now proceed to the next question, next question comes from the line
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:25.720]   of Jim Breschenoff from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead Jim. Hi guys congrats on all the progress.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:32.480]   Maybe just a first quick question for Angus to start him off collaborative research revenues
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:38.200]   is that expected to be a stable number between the you know three to four million dollar level
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:44.240]   or is there any reason that might go up as programs progress and as we think about the
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:50.160]   milestone that got paid in the third quarter is it a simple matter to back out the assumptions
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.040]   around collaborative research revenues and that will give us some sense of the milestone
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:36:01.680]   given that you can't say it explicitly. Yeah thanks Jim for the question. So you know our
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.720]   revenue numbers fluctuate from quarter to quarter you know based primarily on the number of hours
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:13.160]   that we're working on the various genetic programs that are in progress and you can see just looking
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:18.760]   back at the last several quarters we've been you know fairly range bound and call it the
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.680]   two million to five million zone you know when you see increases it's typically a result of
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:31.280]   point in time milestone payments that we receive so you know this milestone payments that we discuss
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:37.640]   today that we'll get in the third quarter will likely increase our revenues in the third
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:42.280]   quarter and that would be sort of an add-on to the range you've seen over the last several quarters
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:49.560]   of that again kind of two to five million dollars two to five million euros rather but okay that's
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:57.480]   that's helpful and then maybe just on cohort one for AFM 24 and what we might learn from that cohort
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:04.120]   can you remind us if you're doing pre and post biopsies and what kind of translational work
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.680]   you might be doing and you know how that might inform you know the ability to recruit
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:20.280]   innate cells to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we do a pre treatment biopsy
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:29.320]   post or on treatment biopsies are optional we do have a significant correlative science program
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:36.440]   looking at peripheral activation markers of NK cells as well as on cytokine profiles
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:44.920]   once we are in the expansion phase so we are recruiting into tumor specific cohorts I think
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:50.200]   this is the part where we will get most of the correlative science as we have a more homogeneous
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:59.400]   patient population we maintain our requirement for a pre treatment biopsy and will have post or
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:08.920]   on treatment biopsies in selected cohorts and then just you know given the comments on the variability
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:19.960]   and peripheral NK cell populations is there any sense in screening patients for their NK cell levels
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:26.680]   given that you know patients who screen low may not have adequate NK cells or macrophages
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:33.720]   to recruit or you feel like within the variability of innate cell in the blood that that you'll be
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:40.360]   able to have an effective treatment and it's not worth screening for that variable I think currently
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:47.880]   it would be premature to yeah depends on what you mean with screening so we are definitely
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:56.760]   determining the levels of circulating NK cells and also looking at some of their characteristics
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:04.680]   I think we currently do not have enough data to define a cutoff or a threshold and this may very
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:12.040]   well vary between tumor histologies and also be dependent on the infiltration of NK cells
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:20.520]   in the tumor microenvironment variable which we have seen in our AFM Columbia study to have
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:27.640]   some impact on the likelihood to respond to patient of patients so I think in the beginning
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:34.840]   of the program we will be open for all comers we will assess all of these important biomarkers
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:40.600]   and then based on the activity data and the readouts that we are seeing we may modify as
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.800]   a program defining certain thresholds but currently I think it would be premature to
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:53.400]   do that and maybe just a final question just the ambianders in collaboration is focused on
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:40:01.640]   cord blood derived NK cells is there any thought through other NK cell sources including potentially
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:13.240]   IPSC derived NK cells um how do you want to take this question or should I take it
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:20.120]   no well I Andreas why don't you go ahead okay yeah you're right when cord blood derived
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:31.240]   NK cells is one source of NK cells and if you watch the field of NK cell based approaches
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:38.440]   especially the field around companies and institutes are providing different sources
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:46.760]   of NK cells there is definitely speed picking up and then there is a variety of options to look
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:55.800]   at and this is what we do not only from our side but we have also received proactive inquiries
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:05.560]   of potential working models together so we are looking at the entire NK cell field and then
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:12.840]   evaluate various options there great thanks for taking the question guys maybe as a quick comment
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:20.120]   so we see this cord blood derived NK cells already quite advanced in clinical development so they
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:26.600]   have already been many patients treated while with the IPSCs currently there is still
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:34.200]   a the safety to be determined and obviously in combination we learn more on their functionalities
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:42.920]   so this is somewhat yet to us on how functional an ITC derived versus a peripheral NK cell is
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:49.480]   and it's good to see the first clinical data so we're quite not only happy but we've we've
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.960]   checked so many different options at the moment for NK cells and we're indeed very convinced about
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:42:00.600]   the activity of the core blood derived cells from MD under them great thanks Adi
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:11.800]   thank you our next question comes from the line of IG from BMO capital the line is now open
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.520]   please go ahead
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:20.040]   hey good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my question this is EK Allen for DOHKIM
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:28.360]   just a couple regarding the BCMA and they engage your I understand that you have limited visibility
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:36.040]   on the entirety of the clinical development pathway but if you can provide any type of insight
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:45.480]   in terms of what genetic kind of has planned in terms of could it potentially pursue an accelerated
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:57.240]   pathway for the assets and secondly again you don't provide complete details on did that milestone
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:04.440]   payments but if you can provide it some additional perspective on what the future milestones for that
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:13.640]   said might hold in terms of you know phase two phase three things of that sort should we expect
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:18.600]   increasing size of value for each milestone payments that'd be helpful for us thanks
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:25.320]   Adi maybe I take the question on the pathway and then hand over to you with the milestones
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:34.120]   yes please go ahead aunt so we are thanks for the question I mean as you already correctly say
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:39.720]   we cannot really speak in detail for genetic but we can share with you I think you're aware
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:47.080]   of course licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal we did with genetic they're
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:54.600]   obviously excited about the strong differentiation potential of the molecule also demonstrated
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:44:01.320]   at ACR at the poster just to review again a very strong preclinical cell killing selective
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:08.760]   no cytokine release very good safety profile and good pharmacodynamic marker specific BCMA
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:17.800]   plasma cell killing in the Sinnoh monkey so you know despite the also recent approvals of the you
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:26.760]   know income first encumbers in the space I would say that genetic shares are excitement with
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:32.200]   the differentiation potential and the way for a potentially best in class molecule maybe I
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:40.520]   I leave it there I think it's a it's a clearly strongly clinically validated space
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:48.440]   and I think this molecule will enable genetic and we as their partner to you know have a
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:56.280]   strong position in the space yeah regarding the financial so I just want to recall the deal
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:06.520]   when it was signed so we received 96 million in upfront cash and can get the total of more than
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:13.800]   five billion in milestones that are in different categories so there are a preclinical mark
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:19.560]   there's a preclinical milestone payment there are indeed multiple clinical milestone payments
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:28.600]   regulatory and sales milestones and on top we can receive royalties which as we described are on
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:38.840]   the higher end of what you would expect for the early nature of the license agreement beyond that
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:47.000]   we're able to disclose any further details unless genetic would allow us or rush would allow us
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:54.040]   to do so usually and that's just a general statement is that the payments will increase
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:46:00.920]   the further the program progresses okay thank you for that and just one more quick question
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:08.120]   I think I might have misheard it and this is in regards to AFM 24 I believe you mentioned that
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:16.920]   there was a patient that had increased an AL6 cytokine levels that would resolve over 24 hours
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:23.160]   I'm just curious was that self-resolving or did that patient receive an AL6 inhibitor
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:30.920]   yeah I can thanks for bringing that up and clarification so the transient AL6 increase was
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:39.640]   reported in the iron enabling synotox study what you you referred to the ACR poster indeed we saw
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:46.600]   that with the dosing a kind of moderate peak that quickly went down was completely resolved
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:54.200]   without any any treatment obviously you know one doesn't do that in the because this is synotox study
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:59.640]   and again when we see this in the context because it was transient and fully reversed leads us to
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:06.840]   the conclusion which of course will be looked at carefully in patients that we should not expect
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:14.200]   any kind of cytokine release syndrome okay thank you for that clarification sure
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   thank you next question comes from the line of email genuine from made in your company
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:33.560]   please go ahead the line is open hello yes hello yes hi can hear you hi sorry that's
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:40.840]   my headsets fall out thanks for taking the questions my first question is that for the AFM 13
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:51.000]   in the for the registration study that the it's assignment two set up so what might be
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:59.320]   the threshold of ORR in the 40 patient and sort of internet readout before you can move forward so
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.320]   just curious what any information you can reveal on that front
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:12.760]   um i'm afraid we cannot give um a concrete response rate it's based also on the Bayesian
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:18.520]   design so there are some interdependence of response rates but we usually do not disclose
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:26.760]   thresholds but it's a classical assignment two stage design okay no problem and also just curious
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:38.680]   in terms of AFM 24 that your dose escalating but at least based on the animal data is any
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:44.360]   thoughts where when you might start to see the potential effective dose to start
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:51.800]   i think currently it's not possible to predict when we will have the optimal
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:49:00.600]   biologically active dose um as there are a number of covariance like binding sites for cd16
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:09.400]   binding sites for egfr and then distribution um and as you know the the animal models especially
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:18.360]   in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are very difficult to translate um the relevant
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:24.760]   talk species and after all it's only a talk species is the synomorgous monkey however
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:33.240]   we do not have any synomorgous monkey two more models available so we cannot really bridge between
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:39.080]   what we see in the toxicology studies and then what we would see in terms of efficacy for
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:45.240]   for tumors so it will be something that we will have to define in our in our clinical program
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:56.680]   okay great maybe one second one last question here is that uh in terms of adaptive incase cell
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:03.960]   from the cobala not deriving itself uh it first of all could that be potentially used in
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:15.480]   started tumor and any comments comments in terms of regarding that uh this is as adi said
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:23.800]   something that we are actively looking into um we're starting out with lymphomas obviously
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:32.600]   with afm 13 targeting cd 30 but our vision is uh that also for afm 24 we will develop
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:40.520]   certain development options in combination with nk cells could be cord blood derived
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:46.520]   in k cells could be nk cells from another source that is something that we will define but
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:55.240]   the intention is also to to have a have a program where afm 24 would be partnered with exogenous
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:02.760]   nk cells okay great thanks appreciate it and congrats for another project this far
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:16.120]   yep no further question at this time for any closing remarks please go out speakers um yeah
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:24.920]   thank you again for listening in and following our our updates um the uh the the program is
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:32.200]   coming smoothly along despite that we are affected by uh by covid uh we have strengthened the team
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:38.120]   significantly in order to address any issues that may relate to the conductance of this
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:46.440]   clinical trials or uh to the uh interactions with the with the specific uh sites so we're very happy
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:53.000]   to be able to uh have been able to address any of the issues that have been arising and i
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:59.560]   indeed want to thank again uh the entire team here at afimet for managing all that through
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:07.800]   this difficult times we're quite excited that we can move forward these programs either as
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:15.160]   monotherapies and now looking at the different options of of combination if you've heard we focus
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:21.240]   on natu killer cells and checkpoint inhibitors in particular pd ones or pd l ones so we feel that
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:27.400]   we have with the multiple programs addressing different targets we can provide a carbon of
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:36.200]   data over the next quarters and uh in years and uh very happy to report any additional updates as

[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.480]   Good morning and thank you for joining us today as we are operating in financial results for
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.160]   the third quarter end of September 27th 2020.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.920]   Yesterday afternoon we issued a press release providing an overview of our financial performance
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.160]   for the quarter including a reconciliation of any non-gap measures we may discuss.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.440]   The copy of the release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website along
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.720]   with the slides we will reference during this call. These items have also been filed as aid

[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.120]   Mentor Officer in Joe Wabuzer at Commodity Risk Management.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.760]   Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone of our safe harbor
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.760]   disclaimer.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.440]   Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements that represent our outlook and current
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.120]   expectations as of the day of this release.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.400]   Other additional factors non-anticipated by management may cause actual results to differ
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.280]   materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   Very information considering those factors has been provided in today's press release
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.120]   on NK in our regular filings with the SEC.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.920]   I'd now like to turn the call over to Fabius Andrii.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480]   Thank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.400]   For the third quarter of 2020, we reported net revenues of $3.08 billion and adjusted EBIDA
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.480]   of $305 million or a 9.9 percent margin, 18 percent higher than a year ago, and an adjusted
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.720]   GAP EPS of 66 cents.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.800]   I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our global team for their continuing commitment,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.240]   dedication and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and healthy.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   By maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging time, I could
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.000]   not be more proud of our team as they have continued to come together to support one another, our
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.080]   customers and consumers.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.640]   Safety is a condition of importance and our team members responded admirably to the unprecedented
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.080]   conditions, supplying products to our customers.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.160]   We're continuously adapting our global operations to the change in channel demand while adjusting
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.800]   our operations to be able to maintain the operations at all our plans and minimize any
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.320]   significant disruption due to labor and health issues.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.760]   We remain diligent in implementing precautionary, proactive steps to better safeguard the wellness
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.080]   and health of each team member while fulfilling our special duty as a food producer to consumers
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.120]   in every region where we operate.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.040]   We encourage direct COVID-19 mitigation costs of roughly $27 million for the quarter and close
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.960]   to $77 million year-to-date.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.480]   The direct costs are related to the extra cleaning of our production and common areas, the extra
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.920]   PPE and the including masks and face shoes that we are providing to all of our team members
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.120]   and the installation of physical barriers in our production areas.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.720]   We also installed dual technology UV and bipolar ionization in every plant to filter the air
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.800]   and neutralize potential viruses.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.040]   We're offering free light health online services that allow for virtual doctor visits and no
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.800]   cost and above all CDC guidelines.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.520]   We remove vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   outbreaks.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.280]   These figures include indirect costs there are more there are a lot of indirect costs there
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.040]   are more difficult to precisely quantify such as overall disruptions for operations less
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.400]   optimal mix and production efficiencies that are not included in these numbers.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.520]   Also we are supporting our communities with our home strong initiative.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.160]   It is an example of how we value the importance role with playing the communities where our
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.080]   team members live and work.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.320]   We understand the responsibility that comes with being a major employer in rural communities
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.800]   and we work hard to contribute to the well being of those communities by not only providing
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.000]   gainful employment opportunities but also participating in volunteers donation and sponsorship opportunities.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.920]   This quarter we include $15 million in SGNA for this initiative.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.440]   Then the specifics of our business despite continuing volatility and challenging marketing environments
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.560]   in Q3 and added operating costs we have continued to generate a superior relative performance
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.200]   to the competition and have remained resilient to market fluctuations.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.760]   This is our reflection of our portfolio approach including the strategy on well-diversified
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.480]   products broad geographical footprint and the relentless focus on key customers for the
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.600]   full quarter operating performance both in US and Mexico significantly improved sequentially
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.040]   and Europe also continue to increase despite the challenges due to COVID-19.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.080]   In Q3 we saw market conditions continue to recover across all of our global operations
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.760]   with the US and particularly Mexico experiencing the struggle rebounds in performance relative
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.720]   to weak conditions during the first half of the year.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.880]   We are pleased with the results especially when taking into account all the disruptions
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.120]   less than optimal product mix and added operating costs when compared to the environment in 2019.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.520]   Despite continuing challenges in global market conditions due to COVID-19 our consolidated
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.040]   results have also remained well balanced and the result of our vision to become the best
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.840]   and most respected company creating the opportunity for a better future for our team members.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.160]   To support our vision we are continuing to implement our strategy of developing a unique
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.840]   portfolio diverse complementary business models continue to relentless pursue operational
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.960]   excellence becoming a more valid partner with key customers and creating an informed environment
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.520]   for safe people safe products and healthy attitudes.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.840]   While market conditions in all our global operations are continuing to improve during
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.760]   the quarter food service demand globally still has not reached prior levels and the environments
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.680]   are still quite challenging some sectors where we operate disruptions from COVID-19 have continued
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.720]   to present a significant challenge on each individual country's demand for protein consumption
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.360]   as well as for the flow of global trades and generate volatility far beyond normal seasonal factors.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.320]   We will maintain our strategy while continuing to improve the portfolio to better respond
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.920]   to individual market dynamics and generate a relative increase in performance over our peers.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.560]   We believe this approach will give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to long
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.800]   run and minimize the full peaks and troughs of the commodity sectors during the third quarter
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.880]   in the U.S. we are continuing to see the main recovery at our fresh operations including from
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.040]   some sectors within food food service with more states gradually losing travel and movement
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.320]   restrictions QSL volume has been especially strong and demand from our customers has been
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.480]   outperforming the industry similar to last quarter commodity large bird reboning was also
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   again the most challenge during Q3 operationally however we continue to improve our relative
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.840]   performance versus the industry across all business units we are continuing to adapt
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.920]   to the shipping channel demand by increasing our volume mix to key customer retailers in addition
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.960]   a large portion of our food service customers are also within the QSL segment
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.320]   which has further dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models our portfolio
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.800]   of differentiated products along with our key customer model are giving us better installation
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.400]   against the volatility we're also much better positioned to adjust products and channel mix
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.720]   even our presence across all bird sizes from small to large within those small birds and
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.000]   case ready segments market supply and demand was again very well balanced during Q3 the
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.120]   demand from retailers especially from our key customers was strong supporting improved performance
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.080]   of our case ready business our market leadership in these categories and more differentiated
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.200]   product portfolio have continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive advantage versus
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.120]   the industry while we commit meant to our key customer strategy has been reflected in the
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.920]   consistency for past results the value of this approach has never been more relevant to our
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.120]   growth than during the current times of great uncertainties and challenges to further support
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.400]   the growth of key customers we are doubling our case ready capacity at our plant in Minnesota
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.280]   by increasing the number of heads processed at the plant while also raising the mix of more stable
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.200]   margin case ready products with this addition we also expect to increase by 20 percent our
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.000]   production of our differentiated higher attributes just bear brand products it is also supported our
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.160]   conversion of one plant from the commoditized large bird deboning to a key customer qsr in
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.680]   the small bird segment the strong relationships we have the key customers are giving us many
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.200]   opportunities to sustain our volume increase since these customer rely on us to satisfy their need
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.880]   for growth in addition many of our key customers maintain a leadership position in their respective
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.200]   categories as a result we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.960]   beyond driving peer growth our key customer strategy also promotes trust enhances long-term
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.520]   relationships and strengthen our margin structure in the u.s. prepare food business revenue declined
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:28.720]   23 percent on 26 percent less volume year over year a large part of this decrease 70 percent
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.240]   of the volume was driven by schools remaining close partially upset by strength in the retail
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.720]   demand on the other hand our margin from sales have improved 29 percent driven by more favorable
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:47.680]   price and mix we continue to simplify our portfolio to improve efficiencies and sheep resources towards
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:55.360]   branded growth in the retail channel our pilgrims brand sales grew 52 percent in our just bear brand
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:03.120]   gain and new distribution resulting in dollar share growth in the retail channel 32 code storage data
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   at the end of august broiler inventory was up 2 percent from the close of q2 but down 1 percent
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.280]   from the previous year lack quarter inventories were up 10 compared to last year this is not surprising
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.160]   considering the mixed simplification doing two ongoing labor constraints seen during q3 and
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.480]   overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result of coded 19 as some markets reopened and
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.440]   the pipelines are empty we are seeing some increasing lack quarter sales during october
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:38.560]   and our reduction in inventories and upward movement in prices you export to exports including pause
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.960]   were up 4.7 percent year over year throughout august roller meet alone was up 3 percent
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:53.680]   in contrast through Q3 our exports have increased by 14 percent euro area outpace in the market china
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.280]   continues to be a significant growth driver and we believe the impact of asf and south east Asia
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:06.240]   and now Germany can provide further support to export demand as we approach the one year anniversary
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.120]   of china reopening to u.s poultry producers are presented with a vastly different market
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.960]   land escape than a year ago china has solidified itself as one of the largest export destinations
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:23.280]   for poultry second only to Mexico china's present as a significant buyer keeps diversification
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:31.280]   of our export portfolio a high priority we have added 95 new direct clients in 2020 and have also
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:37.680]   continued to diversify our product and destination mix sales of non-traditional export items are up
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.920]   30 percent year over year which strengthen us the cutout margin we enter q4 with optimates as
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:50.240]   we continue to place commodity items efficiently leverage pilgrims overall portfolio diversity
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.880]   and prioritize exceptional customer service to meet the needs of our key customers around
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:01.040]   the world after a very challenging first half in 2020 our mexican operations deliver great results
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.600]   in q3 and we recorded one of the strongest q3 in the company's history despite the unfavorable mix
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:14.000]   impacted and added operation cost relative to the same period last year more normalized economic
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.320]   activities and improved supply demand balance in the market our increased share of non commodity
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.520]   products and a very good operation of performance all contribute to the results although overall
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.880]   demand is improving we remain agile and are continuing to adapt our facilities by shifting
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.960]   production to those channels that are experienced better relative demand the persons in Mexico
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.160]   explained some challenges especially in the value categories due to less traffic on retail combined
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.040]   with the contraction in the qsr volume but he began to see some signs of improvements towards the end
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.960]   of the quarter and we believe the positive trend can be sustained into q4 we remain committed in
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:58.480]   low-term growth and demand prospects in Mexico we are continuing to invest in Aldea and premium
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.960]   pilgrims brand both in fresh and in prepared as well as seeing king more market share in the modern
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.440]   channel which will bring more stable margins to our operations our european chicans operations

[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.120]   seven percent and 18 percent higher respectively supported by our exposure to retail and they
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:30.240]   continue to be covering food service and qsr demand in particular relative to q3 of 2019 ebit
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.880]   we still hire 2 percent despite eight percent lower volume and five percent lower revenue

[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.760]   directs towards food service as well as a consistent improvement in food service demand
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.560]   within continental europe have all contributed to a better sequentially improved performance
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:57.040]   versus the prior party they still have not yet reached prior levels even during this challenging
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.880]   time we continue to be relentless in investing in innovation they deliver in labor and new improvements
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.000]   driving better efficiencies managing our cost base and offsetting cost increases to lean
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.440]   manufacturing techniques and capital investments around automation and process flow without

[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.960]   to delivering the safest work environment possible improving the quality of our products
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:29.680]   while achieving our sustainability agenda and bird welfare targets our relative performance
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.800]   to the industry measure as the result of the last 12 months continues to show us improving
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.000]   and I'll pace in the average of the competition in Europe for the next quarter we expect further
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.280]   improvements coming from the food service and qsr segments as these segments adapt to the situation
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.800]   in each country and we remain vigilant and prepared to react and adapt in case market conditions
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:57.120]   change the performance of our newly acquired european pork operations have continued to improve
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.960]   we did that on an upward momentum we have now been profitable on a native basis for the last six
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.800]   quarters in the row with margins also increasing on a consistent basis the improvement in performance
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.240]   was driven by robust demand at retail partially upset by reduction in food service continues
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.200]   strengthening pork exports especially to china as well as the implementation of operation
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.640]   improvements and capture of synergies exports to china remain strong they were up 100 percent
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:30.560]   in q3 also export to china have doubled as a percentage of our total pork sales and we expect
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.760]   demands from china to continue driving strengthening overall exports in the near future
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:42.240]   all of our european fresh pork facilities are approved to export from china so they are well
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.840]   positioned to benefit from those opportunities we also continue to evolve in our strategy
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.160]   and we will significantly increase our volumes with a new key customer in the next quarters
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:59.360]   integration of the assets is ultra-actual expectations over the next few years we expect
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.800]   to generate an improved improvement to achieve a level that is competitive with leading companies
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.000]   with similar portfolio we have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.720]   european assets through some recent wins to increase our retail exposure and strengthen
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.920]   our partnership with key customers we're optimistic about building upon our operation

[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:48.320]   generating the best possible relative results by focusing on factors within our control while
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.960]   ensuring protecting the safety and health of our team members point prices has been rising since
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.800]   august driven higher by a combination of stronger than expected export demand and smaller than
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:08.240]   expected old crop ending stocks in the u.s. USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 2.17 billion
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:15.520]   bushels versus 1.99 billion last year which includes a 550 million bushels increase in export demand
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:22.560]   the current corn crop is projected at 14.7 billion bushels the highest in four years
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.320]   and over 1 billion bushels larger than last year although corn prices have risen from the lows
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:35.760]   we saw in august prices are very similar to where they were this time last year so i've been here
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.760]   prices have also risen since august driven higher by larger than expected export demand
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.600]   primarily to china USDA is projecting the current soybean crop at 4.3 billion bushels
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.520]   up over 700 million from last year despite the large increase in production USDA is projecting
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.600]   new crop ending stocks at 290 million bushels the lowest level in four years the uncertainty
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.560]   over the science of the chinese import program is causing increasing uncertainty and volatility
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.480]   in the oil seeds market globally wheat prices in europe has also risen recently despite the
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.680]   larger than expected russian wheat crop and projected increased supply in other major wheat
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:21.360]   exporters like australia a slow start to the planting season in russia and larger than expected
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.680]   export demand out of the u.s. are contributing to the rise prices in the wheat market on the chicken
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:34.160]   production according to the USDA q3 was down half of a percent relative to q3 2019 as
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.360]   increased live weights did not offset head count reductions the industry continues to maintain
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:45.280]   a larger layer flock we couldn't level 4.4 percent above last year in line with the trends observed
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:52.400]   in qlxc the industry has also managed to reduce the average age of laying hands promoting a younger
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.120]   more efficient reasons this has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to manage
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.320]   supply of eggs in the short term while enabling growth in the long term as the demand environment
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:08.160]   improves overall the trend has shown a slowing of bullet placement growth which is in line with
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.480]   expectations given that most of the bullet placement increases in 2019 and early to 2020
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.040]   were expected to be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period from q2 to q3
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:27.600]   covid 19 related restrictions have slowly been rolled back with many businesses and restaurants
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:34.480]   opening under modified environments to protect worker and consumer health throughout this process
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.600]   consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal and have continued to modify their shopping
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:45.040]   and spending habits in response to the new normal environment this new consumer environment favors
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.160]   the retail channel as many consumers are still required to work from home and choosing to limit
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.320]   exposure to potentially more crowded areas as a result retail demands for chicken like that
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:02.080]   of all proteins have remained supported throughout the quarter while food service demands to trail
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.880]   below years ago level this channel has proven highly adaptable and continues to improve each
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:15.280]   month from the low points in abril led by the qsr segments entering q4 the sda expect production
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:22.400]   to be flat for the quarter on a year over year basis before in 2021 in which the sda expect
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:30.160]   oil production to grow 0.9 versus 2020 high unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:36.240]   to a food marker environment and the fallout effects of covid 19 will impact the channels differently

[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:47.280]   for individual health and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:54.800]   to continue favor favoring the increased frequency of at home meals since chicken continues to be
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:01.520]   one of the most affordable and versatile proteins retail demands likely to remain above year ago
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:07.840]   levels when we expect overall food service demand to remain more volatile and remain below year ago
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:13.840]   levels at least in the near term qsr's ability to adapt quickly to the new environment in a positive

[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.600]   to the challenging macroeconomic conditions while minimizing the impact from volatility in market
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   conditions while we are already well balanced in terms of our birth size exposure we will remain
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.880]   diligent in seeking opportunities to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.840]   portion of our portfolio by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.640]   while optimizing our existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:54.160]   our key customer approach is strategic and creates a basis for further accelerate growth
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.600]   in important categories by promoting more customized high quality innovative products
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.480]   to give us a clear long-term sustained competitive advantage while further improving
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:11.200]   the resilience to market filtration with that left on to additional details to our financials
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:17.120]   our fgna in the 10 quarter was hired versus a year ago as we improve the efficiencies of our expenses
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.000]   but increased support for expanding the just bear brand nationally and the investment for our new
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.080]   prepared foods products both in u_s and mexico as well as the inclusion of the new assets in europe
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.360]   also including in the report that fgna is our 50 million dollars contribution to the hometown
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:40.080]   strong initiative and the doj agreement we will continue to prioritize our capital spending plan
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:45.440]   this year to optimize our product mix that is aimed at improving our ability to supply innovative
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.000]   less monetized products and strengthening partnerships with key customers even during
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.160]   these uncertainty times while we continue continue to evaluate all capex projects and defer
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.200]   those we deem known essential we reiterate our commitment to investing on strong return
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.000]   on capital employee projects that we improve our operational efficiencies entail our customer
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.840]   needs to further solidify competitive advantage for our balance sheets continue to be robust
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:17.280]   given our relentless emphasis on cash flow from operating activities focus on management
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.560]   of working capital and discipline investment in high return projects our liquidity position remains
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.000]   very strong we more than 1.3 billion dollars in total cash and availability we have no short
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.880]   term immediate cash requirements without bonds maturing in 2025 and 20 27 and our terminal maturing
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:42.240]   in 2023 during the quarter our net debt was 1.9 billion the lowest since 2016 and a leverage
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:49.440]   ratio for 2.5 times less 12 months even our leverage remains at a manageable level and we expect to
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.240]   continue to produce positive cash flows this year increasing our financial capability to pursue
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:02.320]   strategic actions we expect 2020 interest expense of around 130 to 140 million dollars we have a
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.280]   strong balance sheet and a leverage that is within our target which are supportive for us to
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.480]   act on great opportunities during these uncertain times we'll remain focused on exercising great
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.920]   care ensuring that we create shareholder value by optimizing our capital structure while preserving
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.880]   the flexibility to pursue a growth strategy and we continue to consider and evaluate all relevant
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.920]   capital allocation strategies that will match the pursuit of our growth strategy and continue
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.760]   to review each prospect accordingly to our value creating standards operator these concludes our

[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:04.640]   keys to minimize background noise we draw your question please press start then two at this
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:14.400]   time we will post momentarily to assemble our roster the question is from bentham employer
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:21.120]   with barclays please go ahead
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.240]   hi good morning how you doing this is Anthony Hernandez on behalf of bentham employer
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:32.960]   my question is regarding COVID-19 how is your current level of absenteeism at plants
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:39.120]   how has that evolved in recent weeks considering the continuously high number of cases in the U.S
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:45.840]   and also if you can provide some of the kind of a wrong way to protect measures related
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.880]   to COVID-19 during the quarter and what do you see going forward thanks yeah thank you and
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.760]   good morning first as we face this global coronavirus pandemic we have been guided
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.960]   by three principles first an uncompromised commitment to the safety of our team members
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.920]   second recognizing and embracing our responsibility to provide quality food for the
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.360]   country and of course in endeavoring to provide continuing employment opportunities and benefits
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:19.760]   to our team members during a time of unprecedented economic appeal so the direct costs that we are
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.400]   related to the extra cleaning and in our production in common areas we also provide the PPE including
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.760]   the masks and feed shoes to all of our team members and we install physical barriers
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.480]   in our production area and of course we are maintaining social distancing whenever wherever
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.200]   areas we can we do more than 10 000 barriers within the first 30 days of the pandemic and
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:49.600]   we continue to upgrade those barriers we also installed that dual technology UV and bi-colonary
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:57.760]   ionization in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses as I mentioned we
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:04.400]   are offering free live health online services for all of our team members that allow for virtual
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:11.120]   doctor visits at zero costs and above all CDC guidelines we remove the vulnerable team members
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.560]   from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreak and that is creating some
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.840]   challenges to our operations because by removing those people we have less people at our plants
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:29.360]   yeah the situation is very fluid it varies from plant to plant but over the last
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.200]   months we have increased our staffing to close to the levels that we were before COVID so we
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:45.920]   are already running a much better mix that we were during the Q2 and we are seeing a very good
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:53.360]   increase in our absenteeism levels as people are more familiar with what we are doing as we're gaining
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:29:03.920]   the trust of the entire communities people are less reluctant to return to work and with that we've been
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:11.680]   improving our ability to execute the optimal mix of course we're also working with our key customers
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:17.760]   to simplify our mix to create a more optimal footprint and with the frequent communication
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   with them we are ensuring there are team members we expect to return to the optimal operation
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.440]   in this quarter
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:33.440]   perfect thanks so I'm gonna work some new results
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:42.240]   the next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal please go ahead
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:50.720]   hey good morning everyone morning Ken just two questions what is as you mix as you change your
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:57.680]   mix what is what was the mix between big small and medium say last year and then what do you
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.440]   think it's going to be now and then what do you think it's going to be in about a year from now
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:08.560]   as you adjust your your product mixes yeah can we are well balanced between small birds
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:15.760]   tray pack and large bird deboning what we are doing is as the as the demand has been shifting
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:22.480]   to more retail we've been shifting shifting our operations also with the growth of qsr we've also
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:30.560]   adapt to those conditions what we are doing for 2021 is to first move that plant from big bird
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:38.160]   deboning to small bird deboning which will increase our presence in that segment we are also doubling
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:46.880]   the capacity in our minnesota plant to comply comply or support the growth of our key customers
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:53.040]   and our just fair brand which has doubled the sales in the online channel over this quarter
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:01.440]   looking into overall portfolio we move from 46 percent of our total sales in retail
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:08.560]   to around 51 percent just in 2020 with small changes in our operation for next year expect
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:16.080]   two percent increase in that portfolio to the retail and one to two percent increase in the
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:22.880]   small bird with those two conversions great my next question is can you talk about the
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.080]   sustainability of the mexican margins you know particularly i did see that there was a
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:33.920]   a little bit of a fx benefit how do you think about the mexican operation i think you did say
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.160]   that it's gonna it's still continuing the momentum into the fourth quarter then how do you think about
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:45.760]   it for 2021 how do we frame it in our minds yeah sure can and we've been talking about
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:51.280]   Mexico over the last year that they are very volatile quarter over quarter but they're more
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.560]   stable if you take a longer period of time or within a year what happened in the first quarter
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:02.480]   or the first semester in Mexico was a complete imbalance during supply and demand so the industry
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:08.480]   increased supply during the first semester and at the same time demand because of the COVID-19
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:14.880]   really create a challenging environment as you remember in Mexico there was no
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:23.120]   support from the government with the COVID-19 like we had in us in Europe there's no governmental
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:31.680]   stimulus or unemployment and benefits we created a sharp slowdown and recession in the region which
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:39.440]   really affected the the the demand both in the food service and retail while in the US we saw
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.960]   an increasing retail compensating at least partially the shut down in food service that didn't
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:51.600]   happen in in Mexico and that's why the supply and demand was completely off balance as the industry
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:33:01.760]   adapted their supply for the Q3 and we at pilgrims adapted to that situation as well we reduce our costs
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:08.080]   and we also cut production the supply and demand improved a lot and we saw the rebound in the food
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:16.880]   service and demand in Q3 and now we have very stable prices during this time in Mexico we expect
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:24.320]   this to continue during Q4 Q4 has always been a stronger quarter for Mexico with the festivities
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:31.680]   we don't know at which point that will be reduced because of the the COVID restrictions we've seen
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:38.960]   some increase in cases in Mexico so there could be some more restrictions in the Q4 but given the
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:46.640]   supply and demand situation that we are right now the results are sustainable now for Q1 we expect
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:53.440]   the industry to increase production to adequate supply and demand and the return to more normal
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:34:01.440]   levels Mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again but we expect to be very stable
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.880]   year over year of course our strategy is supportive of the growth to increase the higher margin
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:13.840]   differentiated products as well we saw a little bit of impact in the prepare foods especially on
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:19.120]   the more affordable products during Q1 but we continue to invest and highly differentiated
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.280]   the pilgrims products continue to sell really well along the turn despite the volatility Mexico is a
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.320]   growing economy and as the population increase their disposable income it leads to a significant
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:36.240]   growth and growth in consumption great I really appreciate the answer thank you okay
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:44.400]   the next question is from Ben bienvenue with Steve earnings please go ahead
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:54.640]   hey good morning I want to ask um you touched on it in your opening comments with ASF in China
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.320]   and in Germany I want to ask on Germany more specifically I would think that's a nice boon
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.720]   for the tool of business just curious on what you're seeing in that business both as it relates to
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.040]   the impact on the domestic market and then an uptick in potential demand from that market as well
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:14.160]   and how you think your position to capture that benefit yeah thank you Ben and the operations
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:21.760]   in Europe are more focused on the retail so we produce most of our products in UK for the retail
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:28.160]   UK market and because of the high welfare we command the premium in that region the big competition
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:37.040]   as you refer is on the food service sector of imported products from Poland and Germany mainly
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:44.880]   and Spain on the pork side as the Germans had these issues with their production and because
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:53.840]   of the ban in China it actually increases the sales in the UK market it also creates the
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:01.040]   opportunity for our UK products to be sold into China so what we saw is that on the what we call
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:09.200]   fifth quarter products a significant increase in pricing but only normal products like loins and
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:14.560]   others we see the prices more stable because it's a zero sum game at the end of the day
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:22.000]   so it increases the opportunity to China so that was welcome I think our sales have
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.800]   like we mentioned have double during Q3 and we're seeing some some very stable pricing
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.160]   but it also increases the competition in the food service segments in UK
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:41.440]   okay great my second question is related to grain and apologies if I missed this in your opening
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:46.160]   comment I did hear your overview of the market could you talk about how your position is relative to
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.560]   the market you know are you more hand and mouth at the moment do you have any basis secured
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.480]   any color you could offer there on how your position you know through the balance of
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:00.720]   fourth quarter and into next year would be helpful hey Ben this is Joe thank you for the question
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.760]   obviously we've seen prices of corn and soybean no increase in the last few months which has been
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:10.240]   which has been the result of a few factors for corn we've seen a reduction from the supply side with
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.600]   USDA reporting six million fewer planted acres than they originally estimated back in March
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:21.440]   we also saw our final stocks for 2019 end up being 200 million bushels less than was expected
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.000]   when the final counting was done on the current crop we actually for the acres of our planet
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.880]   see pretty good yields above trend line yields so it's not an issue on the supply side in terms
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:36.720]   of US production but on the demand side we've also seen much bigger exports at demand primarily
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:42.480]   driven by China still the USDA is projecting a carrier out carry out around 2.1 billion bushels
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.920]   and that includes a 30 percent increase in export demand from last year so even if export demand
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.240]   ends up higher than what you see is projecting corn stocks should still be in mind with previous
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.760]   years on soybean's usd is projecting a 290 million bushel carry out which would be the lowest carry
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:03.440]   out in five years this projection though includes a 31 percent increase in export demand driven by
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.480]   China in addition to increase export demand Argentina which is one of the world's largest
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:13.600]   oil seed exporting countries is in the midst of a historic economic crisis is just causing farmers
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.640]   there to hold back available supplies from the market adding more pressure to the US to meet this
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.840]   demand we believe the market is likely to feel anxious about US soybean supplies until there's
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:29.040]   a resolution to this currency situation in Argentina or in South South American supplies
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:34.080]   can be available to meet this demand in terms of how our physicians we've always said that our
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.200]   hedging strategy is adaptive to the market conditions and the risk we see and we feel very comfortable
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:44.000]   with where we are in corn and soy we do recognize the risks of soybean supplies in the US and our
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:55.760]   positions reflect that okay awesome thanks and that's all thank you as a reminder if you have a
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:05.040]   question please press star then one the next question is from Michael Piken with Cleveland
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:10.880]   Research please go ahead yeah hi good morning I just wanted to touch base a little bit more
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:17.280]   in terms of you know the move I guess you know into retail and you know some of that big bird
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.880]   product is that being chopped up and put into trays and you know how is that impacting
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.600]   you know some of the margins on the commodity business yes Mike there's a lot of product
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:36.160]   from the big birds especially during promotional season seasonality during the summer that from
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:42.480]   the big birds end up being put in the tray to be sold in the retailers we continue to do that I think
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:50.000]   the challenge to the industry is that we need to have the label available and the facilities available
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.400]   to do more of that and that's why the industry has not increased more the production to the
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:03.600]   tray pack as we as we want or as the demand continues to grow it's also because of that that
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:10.480]   we are increasing the capacity in our Minnesota plate so as of today yes we are buying big
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.240]   bird meat and we continue to put it on a tray especially during Saturdays and I think the whole
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:23.440]   industry is doing that okay great and then my second question is you know just looking at the
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.680]   you mentioned that your absentee rates are starting to go down and you're starting to get back to
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:34.640]   your normal mix some in terms of some of the deboned dark meat do you are you starting to return that
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.680]   you know historic levels and what could that mean for the leg quarter prices which is being
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:45.040]   you know the most pressure cannot help or is this you know the fact that China is taking more poor
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:50.720]   cannot help leg quarters why haven't leg quarter prices moved if there's more deboned dark meat
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.840]   potentially being produced and you know it seems like you know at the very least China's taking more
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:04.160]   US poor yes you're right Mike because of the absenteeism and also the food service industry
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:13.200]   in us the industry produced 3% more leg quarters in July and August than the same period last year
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.240]   despite a lower total production that put a lot of pressure in the leg quarter pricing
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:25.920]   as we are seeing more the reopening of the food service and as we are seeing the absenteeism and
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.640]   the staffing of our plants increasing for us and for the whole industry we're seeing more
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:37.440]   deboning we are already at levels comparable to last year in terms of deboning which will reduce
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:44.160]   the pressure in the leg quarters of course China has been also more active in the leg quarter
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:52.080]   market over the last month and we're seeing that in the leg quarter inventory that was up
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:57.840]   on a sequentially basis up to august but we are seeing a reduction and also the inventory
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:06.000]   today is down 9 compared to the peak q1 average that we have so those two factors can contribute
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.720]   to the reduction in the leg quarter production which is a commodity item as I mentioned and the
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:21.760]   China interest I think we saw over the last weeks although not today the increase in the oil prices
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:30.480]   and the reduction in the dollar which increase the availability of dollars from the developing
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:37.200]   countries which also increases the demand for leg quarters so what could help on the leg quarters
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.480]   going forward it's both on supply and demand on supply is exactly what you said last leg quarters
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:48.800]   because of the improvement in labor efficiencies and the more sales in the domestic market on the
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:55.200]   food service and on demand because of low prices and because of more available income in this in
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:11.120]   the developing color the next question is from Peter galbo with bank of america please go ahead
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:18.960]   hey guys good morning thanks for taking the question um you know fabio just as i'm thinking
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:23.840]   about it you know the the small bird and resale channels obviously has been tremendously profitable
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.080]   for you guys during you know this time period um and you know with the plant conversion coming
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:34.640]   but you know with with commodity big bird remaining you know in a cutout value have
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:41.120]   here remaining under such pressure just at what point does it make sense to start talking about
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.720]   converting another plant whether that's to retail or or to small bird because it just it just seems
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:52.560]   like that big bird portion is is not going to improve without more capacity either being converted
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:59.440]   or taking out of the market you know it's in some capacity sure thank you Peter i think the decision
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:06.160]   to convert the plan is a more long-term decision and we always make those decisions combined with
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:13.920]   our key customer strategy as we see the demand of these key customers growing we take action
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.880]   in our portfolio so and that makes a lot of sense for us to do that conversion right now
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:26.080]   from that uh from that operation from big bird to small bird to support this growth i think again
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:32.160]   you need to look into a more broader long-term perspective we continue to expect the food
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:39.200]   service sector to rebound if you look at the food service sector today the food service restaurants
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.480]   are down 13 percent year over year and that is impacting the big part deboning for sure
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:52.080]   while the kfrs are up nine percent as we go to a more normal operations as we see
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.840]   maybe the development of vaccines we don't know when that's going to happen or we see more openings
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:04.240]   of the restaurants we expect the food service restaurants especially on the full service
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:12.320]   to regain some market share that they are not operating today so i think it's a long-term
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:20.080]   decision and it's also a very difficult decision to move from big bird to a smaller because we
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:27.040]   have the growers and we have the feed mills it's all built to that specific bird our plants
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:34.240]   in united states are really customized to that specific segment so any conversion it really
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:42.160]   requires significant capital and requires some significant changes in the overall supply
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:48.720]   chain both starting from the growers your feed mills and your field operations so it's a it's a
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:54.640]   high capital investment that needs to be supported in the for the long run so that's why we don't
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:02.480]   see a lot of conversions in our industry of course if this situation continues for for a longer period
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:10.160]   of time you can see some conversions i think also it's important to know that some other players
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:16.640]   don't have the key customer relationships that we have and moving from the big bird to the small bird
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:24.640]   or to the keys ready require a customer and a key customer to support and since they don't have those
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:32.720]   relationships it's harder for them to do some conversions all right no that's that's helpful
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:38.400]   um and then maybe just to follow up you know given where the balance sheet is now and something you
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.240]   talked about in your period remarks you know how should we think about m&a potential maybe from a
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:50.000]   geographic perspective or does it make sense to get bigger in pork in in europe and you know going into
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.360]   2021 uh just any help there and then maybe you can also comment on any updates on your CFO search
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:03.920]   thanks very much sure in terms of strategy i think our strategy continues to say and our growth strategy
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:09.120]   continues in fact and as we mentioned we have a very strong balance sheet we're looking to increasing
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:17.680]   our prepared food operation and our branded operation to to create a more balanced portfolio
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:23.680]   and we're also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more value from operational
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:31.040]   efficiencies we're seeing targets both in the west and outside the west geographical diversification
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:37.600]   and to growth in Europe and we will evaluate all alternatives to our value creation standards
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:49.120]   in terms of the CFO we are in the process of finding another CFO we already engage recruiting firms
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:48:00.960]   and we should have some some news in the near future great thanks very much guys the next question
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:07.680]   is from Adam Stan Wilson with Goldman Sachsen Co please go ahead uh yeah thank you again everyone
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:15.600]   morning hi so maybe first just a clarification or a little more detail on the
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:21.520]   expansion of the Minnesota plant for case ready and the conversion of the texas plant
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:29.520]   small bird from big bird um what's the net impact on your production volume um and what's the capital
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:37.120]   cost of those uh projects yeah in terms of total volume i think we should be just a little bit up
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:44.480]   we expect to be to grow in line with uh usd expectations and the industry for 2021 which
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:52.880]   is a little bit lower than 1% yes as we have more birds in Minnesota but we'll also reduce the weight
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:58.160]   in our operation on the big bird that we are transforming to a small bird so we expect to
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:07.200]   be for 2021 in line with those two in terms of investments it's not very significant to our
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:16.000]   total capex um as the conversion of the small bird plant it's it's not uh it's a simpler conversion
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.480]   of course that qsr requires uh from the assigned which is portion equipment and some marination
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   equipment and we're going to invest in automation in that plant as well today is a manual deboning
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:35.280]   operation and we're going to invest in automated deboning so the investment is close to 20 to
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:42.560]   25 million dollars in that operation and in the uh in case of the case value operation this goes to
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.520]   70 million dollars so overall it is a total of 100 million dollars that we're going to invest in
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:54.880]   those two conversions okay that's a helpful call there and then the the follow-up was um i just
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.400]   i'll make sure i heard something right from the paragraph marks that he talks about the
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:05.360]   prepared food business in the u.s declining uh 26 percent i think is what i heard um and maybe
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.040]   hoping to expand it on that that's a business that i think has had a bit more challenges over the years
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:17.840]   and just is do we is it really just a question of returns of school and food service traffic or
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:24.800]   how do we think about that business or a margin profile moving forward yeah then that's exactly it
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:30.160]   we in our prepared food business we have a strong brand which is the pierce brand that is meaning
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:38.320]   a food service brand we also are very strong in the school with our gold case brand both those
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:45.120]   segments are the ones that are most most affected by the the covid 19 the non-commercial food service
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:53.520]   that includes schools were down 66 percent at q2 and now they are down 43 percent we are seeing some
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:51:00.640]   school reopens which could help but it's a segment that is still down 40 percent on what we call the
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:05.920]   commercial food service which is the street business where our pierce brand is a is a leading brand in
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:15.840]   wings and in chunks we saw that at q2 they uh end up 36 percent lower than the prior year
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:21.600]   but they're rebounding and then today they are close to four percent lower than the same period
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:28.160]   less last year so the food service business has been recovering and with that our pierce brand has
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:37.680]   recovered and our volumes but the school system is still close to 40 percent lower than the prior
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:44.320]   year and that's why we're investing in more retail branded business as we mentioned our
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:51.360]   pierce brand has increased more than 30 percent and we have been very successful in spending the
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:56.960]   just bear brand on the fresh category but it's being very successful on on the online segment
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:03.440]   and also on the on the higher attribute segment in our key customers to the prepared food segment
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:09.760]   all right great that's the top of color I'll pass it on thank you thank you
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:17.760]   the next question come from Carla Casella with safety Morgan please go ahead
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:25.680]   hi my question's regarding your leverage um the three times target how comfortable or how high
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.640]   would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional MNA and are you seeing any
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:36.400]   more MNA opportunities just given the volatility in worldwide protein market
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:43.600]   yeah thank you Carla we we set this target of two to three times because it's the best
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:52.000]   capital structure that can protect and reduce our interest payments while not creating any any
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:00.320]   any problem for for our bonds and for our leverage the two to three times is in normal operations
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:07.920]   of course during some acquisition if we have a great plan on how to reduce that back we can go
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:15.680]   further I don't think there is a number that uh it's specific or on where we go I think it's
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.640]   more about what is the plan to leverage and of course the plan to leverage could include
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:27.600]   the issue of stock and that's why pilgrims as a public traded company has that opportunity
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:34.000]   to use the stock as a currency not to increase the leverage two points where we don't think it is
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.120]   prudent in the case of significant acquisition that will be transformational for the company
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:47.360]   okay and just one last point no in terms sorry in terms of MNA we are seeing more targets of
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:54.000]   course the the whole situation about traveling has created some challenges in terms of seeing
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:01.840]   and visiting assets but we are seeing some targets that are still very interesting to us
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:10.240]   and could create a lot of value for our shareholders okay great and then just in the event that JBS is
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:14.480]   able to list the U.S. business would that cause any need for changing your structure
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:22.000]   yeah we don't believe so I think JBS has said many times that they continue to support
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.760]   pilgrims to be a public traded company and just as I mentioned it is a great way for us to
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:34.240]   to keep our growth we can use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:40.160]   and transformational event for pilgrims okay thank you
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:49.200]   once again if you have a question please press star and one on your telephone
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:57.760]   gentlemen there are no more questions registered at this time I would like to turn the conference

[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:37.440]   margin volatility in challenging marking conditions relative to competitors we'll continue to seek
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:42.720]   new growth potential both organically and through acquisitions while offering even more differentiated

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.580]   >> Welcome to the Eversource Energy Q3 2020 Results Conference call.
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.060]   My name is John and I'll be over here for today's call.
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.020]   At this time all participants are in the only mode.
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.900]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.740]   During the question and answer session if you do have a question press star
[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.500]   then one on your touch phone phone.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.280]   Please note that this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.680]   And I want to turn the call over to Jeffrey Cotton.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.220]   >> Thank you very much John.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.320]   >> Good morning and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.160]   I'm Jeff Cotton, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.420]   During this call we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website.
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.240]   And as you can see on slide one some of the statements made during this investor call may
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.120]   be forward looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.120]   of the U.S. private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.840]   The forward looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.660]   to risk and uncertainty which may cause the actual results
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.780]   to differ materially for forecast and projections.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.100]   These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.720]   Additional information about the various factors
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.900]   that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on form 10K
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.300]   for the year ended December 31st, 2019 and our form 10Q for the three months ended June 30th, 2020.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.520]   Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAP measures
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.980]   and how those measures reconcile to GAP results is contained within our news release
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.080]   and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10K.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.800]   Seeking today will be Phil Lambo, our Executive Vice President and CFO.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.320]   Also joining us today are Joe Nolan, our Executive Vice President for strategy, customer
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.560]   and corporate relations.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.240]   John Marrera, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory and Jay Booth, our Controller.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.600]   Now I will turn slide two and turn over the call to Phil.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.000]   >> Thank you, Jeff.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.800]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.680]   I hope everyone on the call remains healthy and that your families are safe and doing well.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.060]   This morning I'll cover a variety of areas, review the results of the third quarter,
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.940]   discuss recent regulatory developments including the acquisition of the assets
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.180]   of Columbia GAS of Massachusetts, provide an update on recent developments
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.640]   around our offshore wind partnership with Orsif.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.040]   I'll start with slide two noting that recurring earnings were $1.02 per share
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.760]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of $0.98 per share
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.280]   in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.620]   GAP results which include a charge of $0.01 per share relating
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.240]   to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia GAS of Massachusetts told $1.01
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.920]   per share in the third quarter of 2020.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.900]   In the first nine months of 2020 recurring earnings excluding Columbia GAS acquisition cost total $2.80
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.260]   per share compared with recurring earnings of $2.69 per share in the first nine months
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.280]   of 2019 and excluding the Northern Path transmission impairment charge.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.440]   GAP results for September of this year were $2.76 per share.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.280]   Turning to our business segments, our electric distribution segment earned $0.60 per share
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.400]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.820]   The low earnings were results of both higher storm restoration costs
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.700]   and property tax expense as well as the impact of sub-share dilution.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.560]   Our electric transmission segment earned $0.36 per share in the third quarter
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.700]   of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of $0.33 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.480]   Improved results were driven by the continued investment and reliability
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.600]   in our transmission facilities partially offset by shared dilution.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:38.260]   Our gas distribution segment lost $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.920]   with a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of last year.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.740]   Improved results were due to higher revenues.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.900]   I should note that because we didn't close on our acquisition of Columbia gas
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:00.740]   of Massachusetts assets until October 9th, the transaction had no impact on this,
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.320]   the gas segment, the segment during the quarter.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.840]   Each quarter this year, we booked acquisition related costs at the parent
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.820]   and have segregated them for increased transparency.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.360]   Beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, ongoing results of our new gas franchise
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.880]   which is named Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts will be reflected
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.700]   in the natural gas segment.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.060]   Integration related costs, however, will continue to be recorded separately
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.140]   at the parent and excluded from our recurring gas earnings.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:45.900]   Our water distribution segment earned $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.580]   with earnings of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.220]   Improved results were due to a $3.5 million after tax gain on the sale
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.780]   of our Henum Massachusetts area facilities to the town.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.480]   Eversource parent earned $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020 excluding the Columbia gas
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.880]   of Massachusetts asset acquisition cost equal to our earnings in the third quarter of last year.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.300]   As you probably noted in our earnings reliefs and can see on slide 3,
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.480]   we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings per share guidance of $3.00 and $0.60 to $3.00 and $0.70
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.780]   and it is excluding the non-recurring costs related to the purchase
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.520]   of Columbia gas of Massachusetts assets.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.600]   We are also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.060]   from our core regulated business through the year 2024.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.540]   We continue to be -- to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range largely
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.080]   due to the investments we need to make on behalf of our customers
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.980]   as we outlined for you earlier in the year.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.900]   As a reminder, while we fully expect the Columbia gas assets to be accredit
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.520]   to our earnings per share starting immediately in 2021,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.020]   we have not yet updated our long-term financial outlook to reflect the acquisition
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.380]   of Columbia gas assets in our capital, our cap backs that are our earnings growth.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:30.860]   In addition, as we disclosed previously, earnings from offshore wind would be incremental
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.180]   to our core business growth.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:40.140]   We'll provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecast adding
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.520]   in every Swiss gas company in Massachusetts projections and provide an update
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.840]   of our offshore wind partnership during our year-end calls in late February.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   From the third quarter results, I'll turn to slide four and our experience restoring power
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.940]   after tropical storm ETAES ravaged Connecticut on October 4th.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.840]   We serve 149 cities and towns in Connecticut and every one
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.920]   of these communities suffered damage from ETAES, much of it catastrophic.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.660]   As you can see on the slide, we had nearly 22,000 damage locations that we had
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:27.700]   to address and brought in an army of electric restoration and tree crews to restore power,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.420]   all the while working on the restoration in a pandemic setting.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:38.800]   The restoration process lasted nine days, meaning we completed our work one
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.680]   to two days faster than we had in the last two tropical storms that hit Connecticut,
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.720]   even though we had 30 to 35 percent more damage locations.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:55.460]   And most importantly, we completed that work safely with no serious electrical contact
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.120]   and no COVID exposure among the enormous workforce we brought to Connecticut.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:07.880]   Just a tremendous effort by all of our employees from across all parts of every source.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:16.140]   At this time, we estimate that deferred cost across all three states will total more
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:23.220]   than $275 million, with a vast majority of that's incurred in Connecticut.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:29.080]   That figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:35.700]   We're still actively pursuing invoices from hundreds of vendors that assisted us
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.260]   during the statewide restoration effort.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.980]   Where we were setting new poles or hanging miles of new wires or replacing hundreds
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.040]   of transformers, these related costs have to be capitalized.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:54.560]   The ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation of performance in safely
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.180]   and expeditiously restoring power to our customers is pending an ongoing review
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.500]   by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or PURO.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:10.980]   That review is scheduled to be completed in late April of 2021.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:19.180]   Sticking with our regulated business, I'll turn to slide 5 and a review
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.740]   of this year's distribution rate reviews.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:27.860]   This past Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities issued its decision
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.880]   in the End Star Gas rate review that we filed last year.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.160]   It supports our continued investment in the End Star Gas system
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.660]   on behalf of our 300,000 customers.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.760]   The decision allows End Star Gas to increase distribution revenues
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.580]   by $23 million on an annualized basis.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:55.160]   The DPU approved an ROE of 9.9% and a capital structure with 54.77% equity.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:02.180]   It also permits us to implement performance-based rate making for a 10-year term
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:09.840]   that with sounds operating performance by End Star Gas will target annual base rate increases
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.240]   of inflation plus 1.03%.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.760]   This is an earning sharing mechanism that would return 75% of the benefit to customers
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.220]   should we see the ROE of 10.9% and sharing mechanism on the downside
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.840]   if our ROE falls below 8.4%.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.640]   Also exciting is the decision also approves our first-ever geothermal pilot program.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.060]   Our other longstanding rate proceeding involves public service of New Hampshire.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:45.800]   In New Hampshire last month, we and all the parties to the PSNH rate case filed a proposed
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.380]   settlement in the rate review that is pending for nearly, you know, a year and a half.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:57.680]   You can see from the slide, we settled on a $45 million annualized rate increase
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.720]   that includes a 9.3% return on equity and a 54.4% equity layer.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:14.520]   Should regulators approve the settlement, the permanent increase would take effect in January 1st of 2021.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.020]   You may recall that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission allowed us
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:27.460]   to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately $28 million back in July, July 1st
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.160]   of 2019.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.640]   The final approved rates would be retroactive back to that date, 18 months.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.360]   We would recover that in a true up over the course of the year 2021.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.260]   We can settle, consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.260]   to PSNH's first general increase in about a decade.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:56.180]   And have asked the New Hampshire PUC to approve the settlement before the end of November.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.380]   From the rate review, reviews, I'll turn it to slide six
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:06.500]   and our recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas and Massachusetts
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:12.080]   for $1.1 billion of cash, excluding working capital adjustments.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.260]   Most of these assets were signed to Emerson West Gas Company in Massachusetts.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.460]   A new subsidiary I mentioned that we formed in May of 2020.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.460]   As you can see on the slide, much of Emerson West Gas's service territory is adjacent
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.040]   to Endstar Gas or Yankee Gas Service Territories.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.340]   Additionally, Endstar Electric already provides electric service to about 20
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.060]   of the communities that Emerson West Gas serves with natural gas.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:49.160]   As a result, we expect to realize operational benefits for our newest 330,000 natural gas customers
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.280]   and the communities where they live.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:00.420]   To finance the transaction, we sold approximately $500 million of equity in June
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.360]   and we financed the death portion of the transaction in August.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.460]   And again, we are very confident that this transaction will be accretive
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.780]   to our earnings per share in 2021 and incrementally accretive in the years ahead.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.900]   A critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:24.500]   to all stakeholders is an eight-year rate plan that we negotiated with the Massachusetts Attorney
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.920]   General and other key parties prior to our filing
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.200]   with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   The key elements of that plan are listed on slide seven.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.860]   It allows us to make the necessary investments in our episodes gas of mass system
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.960]   and reflect those investments and rates in a reasonably timely manner.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.680]   We're thankful that the DPU approved the settlement and the acquisition very quickly.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.220]   Now that we have the keys to the property and a long-term plan in place,
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:59.940]   we are focused on providing our new Emerson West Gas customers with the same high level
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:06.380]   of service that we provide our other 550,000 natural gas distribution company customers
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.220]   that we have in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.460]   As I noted earlier, we plan to integrate Emerson West Gas
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:20.180]   of Massachusetts into our updated 5D projections that we'll provide you in February.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:27.780]   We continue to project approximately $3 billion of regulated company capital investments this year.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:33.940]   Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and the need to take crews off of capital projects
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:39.480]   for a significant part of August to deal with the aftermath of tropical storm Isaias.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.240]   Through September, our capital investments totaled approximately $2.2 billion.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:52.240]   That's approximately the same level as this time last year in 2019.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.200]   We made considerable progress on our transmission capital program
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.880]   in the third quarter, putting several projects into service at or below budget.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:08.800]   These benefits of lower cost will slow through to New England's electric customers.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:15.900]   From the regulated business, I'll turn to offshore wind partnership with Orsted on slide 8.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.820]   We've had a few developments since our July 31st earnings call.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:28.000]   The most significant development was that in August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.180]   posted a complete review schedule for our 130 megawatt South Fork project on Long Island.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:42.280]   The schedule culminates in a decision on a construction and operations permit or COP,
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.400]   as it's known, in mid January of 2022.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.200]   We are also making progress on the other permits.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.860]   In September, we filed a settlement proposal with the New York Department of Public Service
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.720]   to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the construction operations
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.960]   and maintenance of the project that lies within New York jurisdiction.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:12.780]   In October, several of New York State agencies signaled their support for this proposal
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.820]   by signing on to the agreement.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.400]   We've structured an agreement on host community payments
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.720]   in the necessary real estate rights with the town of East Hampton
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.940]   where the offshore cable was landed and will be connected to the Long Island grid.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.260]   New York Public Service Commission citing here in South Fork is scheduled
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.720]   to commence the first week of December.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.640]   We continue to expect the state signing process to be completed in 2021
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.160]   before bone issues the COP.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:52.120]   Based on that schedule, we now expect the project end to service in the fourth quarter of 2023.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:58.520]   This is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our May and July earnings calls
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.540]   while we were still waiting for the review schedule.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:10.480]   Turning to our other projects, you recall that we filed our bone application for Revolution Wind in March.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:17.140]   We expect bone to establish a review schedule for that project in the first quarter of 2021.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:24.400]   We do not expect to provide an updated in-service date for this project until the schedule is issued,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:31.620]   but at this point it is unlikely that the project will end as service by the end of 2023.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:37.480]   Also, we filed our sunrise wind application with bone on September 1
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.260]   and expect bone to establish a review schedule for the project next year.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:49.680]   Once we receive that review schedule, we'll be able to better estimate a more up to date in-service schedule.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.360]   But again, at this time it would seem that the end of 24 in-service is not likely.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.560]   We're very optimistic about our offshore wind business and expect to have many opportunities
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.120]   over the coming months and years to expand our offshore wind partnership
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.500]   beyond the 1700 and 14 megawatts currently under contract.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:17.500]   As we mentioned before, we have enough leaf capacity to construct at least 4,000 megawatts
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.760]   on the 550 square miles of ocean tracks that we have under long-term leaves
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.660]   off the southeast coast of Massachusetts.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:33.260]   To this point, on October 20th, we submitted a number of alternative bits
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:39.980]   into the second New York offshore wind IRSP, where the state is looking for between 1,000
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.860]   and 2,500 megawatts.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:47.980]   New York State officials have indicated that they expect to announce the winners.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.480]   Before the end of the year.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.100]   Our sunrise project, as a reminder, won the largest portion
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.480]   of New York's first IRSP last year, 880 megawatts.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:07.500]   Additionally, just last week Rhode Island Governor Gina Romando announced
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:13.420]   that her state will target early next year for issuing an IRSP to 600 megawatts
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.380]   of additional offshore wind.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.040]   As you know, the majority of our revolution wind capacity, 400 megawatts,
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.120]   will be sold to Rhode Island, with the balance going to Connecticut.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:31.700]   Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.820]   >> Thanks, Phil.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:39.300]   And I'll turn the call back to John just to remind you how to enter questions in the Q&A queue.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.460]   >> Thank you.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.620]   If you do have a question, press star 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.880]   Once again, that's star than 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.940]   If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.880]   >> Thank you, John.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.200]   Our first question this morning is from Shah from Guggenheim.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.340]   Good morning, Shah.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.120]   >> Good morning, Jeff.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.740]   Good morning, Phil.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.380]   >> Good morning, Shah.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.160]   >> So a couple questions here.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.320]   I just want to fill some of your language around sort of the growth rate, you know,
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.700]   obviously, which still excludes Columbia gas and offshore wind.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.200]   Obviously, these are, you know, very creative and you're already conservatively kind
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.340]   of well within your band.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:27.720]   So should we sort of be thinking about these incremental items as potentially rating your
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.880]   growth rate to maybe 6% to 8% or something that will hit you to the top end
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.380]   and then sort of extend that runway with your current trajectory?
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:42.120]   I mean, the reason we ask is 6% to 8% seems to be sort of that new top quartile bucket
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.240]   in our space where 5% to 7% is becoming a little bit more typical.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.940]   So here's how you're sort of thinking about this.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:54.140]   Do you see value to be in the top quartile or you don't think you need to award it for it?
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.820]   So I'm curious on that as we think about layering its plan.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:04.840]   >> Sure. Sure, thanks for the question and I hope you've been doing well.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:13.200]   Certainly, the addition of Columbia gas and will be additive to our existing forecast.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.040]   So we're working through all the details of that so we're able to provide you
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:26.900]   with a full update in February but we expect to get significant benefit from that franchise
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:36.580]   and as say, we also expect as those offshore wind projects come online to also be additive.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:43.100]   To remind folks, I know I said it but and you did that the 5% to 7% growth rate is
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:49.160]   from the existing core business which doesn't include Columbia assets.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:54.980]   It also doesn't include grid modernization activities
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:23:00.540]   that are currently pending in Connecticut and New Hampshire or AMI
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:08.720]   that could be a potential to move forward relatively soon in Massachusetts
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.000]   in terms of taking a look at that by the regulator.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.940]   So I see that we have a number of levers to grow and grow
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.860]   at even a higher rate than we expected before.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:30.500]   >> Got it, that's helpful and then just lastly for me is can you just maybe talk a little bit
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.500]   about your expectations for the legislation in Connecticut?
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.900]   I mean the legislation that passed was more constructive than the draft legislation
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.500]   but obviously some disappointment with the refunds and penalties offset
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.720]   by the potential upside from like PBRs.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.420]   So how are you guys thinking about this entirely?
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:59.220]   >> Sure, the energy legislation we've said consistently that PBR is a formula
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.540]   and a template that we think is effective.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:11.820]   We have PBR structures in other states and we think that having a robust discussion
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.560]   on PBR in Connecticut makes a lot of sense
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.460]   so we're very supportive of that provision.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:27.180]   Really the energy legislation directed Pura to evaluate that and open a docket
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:35.320]   by the middle of next year so June of 2021 and it authorizes Pura
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.220]   to establish storm standards and potential penalties as you mentioned.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:46.320]   There is an increased potential of penalties currently.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:52.460]   Those penalties are 2 and 1/2 percent of our distribution revenues in Connecticut
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:59.860]   and that goes up to 4 percent so it also gives Pura some additional time to review cases
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.860]   so which is also something that seems to be appropriate.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:09.700]   So the legislation as you indicated is out there
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:16.240]   and Pura is working through the details of it and we expect to be working through that
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.100]   in a constructive way with them over the next several months.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.040]   >> Got it, terrific.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.920]   That's all I had today.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.740]   Thanks guys.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.680]   >> All right.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.060]   >> Thanks.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:25.580]   >> Thanks Sharke.
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:30.280]   Our next question is from Steve Fleischman from Wolfe.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.560]   Good morning Steve.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   >> Good morning.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.920]   Phil, can you hear me?
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.680]   >> Yes Steve, I can.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.580]   >> Yeah, great.
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:46.740]   So just a question on the delays and your offshore wind projects.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:53.040]   Could you maybe talk to -- I know we don't know the exact timing but how should we think
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:26:02.700]   about the impact on the economics of those projects from delay or puts and takes
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.520]   and is it hurting the economics of the projects you already have signed up to?
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.260]   >> Yeah, thanks for your question Steve and I hope you and your family are doing well.
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:24.160]   I guess to go to the puts and takes piece, you know, I don't think that folks should automatically
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.520]   think that schedule changes result in ups or downs.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:35.340]   There's some benefits or that people may not consider in that.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:42.180]   So certainly if you are looking at adjusted schedules, you might be able
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:48.540]   to adjust your installation vessel optimization better, you know,
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:56.480]   determine sizes themselves or getting larger so you could move to larger turbine sizes
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.260]   if projects are due at a later time period versus an earlier time period.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:07.800]   And certainly the cost supply chain and availability
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.120]   of materials and supply chain is only getting better.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:19.020]   So I would say that, you know, there's opportunities for improved cost economics
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:23.860]   as you move into a schedule that, you know, you may not think of, you know,
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:29.020]   I think people generally think of projects as, you know, physical delay is a cost increase
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:36.300]   but that there are other elements that work here on the offshore wind business that offset that.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.460]   >> How about any negatives?
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.400]   Is it how about like do you lose, you know, lose any tax credits or anything else?
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.300]   >> Yeah, certainly [inaudible]
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.340]   >> Like it's just time value?
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:52.300]   >> Yeah, in terms of the schedules we're looking at, we don't expect
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.640]   to have any impact on our tax assumptions.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:03.220]   But certainly significant delays, delays could have impacts on your tax assumptions,
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:12.780]   delays could also have impacts on contracts that you have with counter parties but in our specific case,
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:18.540]   so that's the general case and our specific case, we're confident that we have the ability
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:24.580]   to work within both of those, the tax area and the contract area in an effective way
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:31.740]   with where we see the schedules going in the future.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.480]   >> Okay. Thank you.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.200]   >> Thank you.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.840]   Our next question is from Angie from Seaport Global.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.740]   Good morning Angie.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.200]   >> Good morning.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.600]   So I have a question about Massachusetts.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.700]   You know, they've had this very constructive decision for ENSAR gas
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:29:00.700]   but the state is clearly looking at the future of gas LDCs and so how do you guys see it especially
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:09.200]   in light of the fact that you just acquired an additional gas utility in Massachusetts?
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.360]   >> Good morning Angie and thank you for your question and hope you're doing well.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:21.360]   You know, the way that I was positioned or the way that I think people should think
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:27.620]   about it is that there's nobody, first of all, who's more aggressive in terms of looking
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.220]   at clean energy strategies and carbon reduction and ever source in terms
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.400]   of having carbon neutral goals like 2030.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:42.040]   We have worked effectively with all parties in all states but in Massachusetts
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:49.500]   where the Attorney General and others want to take a look at, you know, sort of the future
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:55.280]   or the outlook in terms of the gas business, we've been working
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.260]   with these intervening parties for many years and we'll continue to work with them
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.180]   on what we think an appropriate strategy is there.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:15.980]   So this is a long-term outlook in terms of that the state wants to have aggressive clean energy
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:22.600]   and carbon reduction targets with wholly supportive of that and we look forward to working,
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.940]   you know, with all the parties there.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:34.260]   But we don't see it as a threat to the gas distribution business in the region at all.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:41.460]   >> Okay and in Connecticut, you know, there's this recent back and forth between you guys
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:48.280]   and Pora about the extension of the lack of basically disconnections on the back of COVID.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:54.880]   I mean, it sounds a bit concerning that Pora is pushing back so strong
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.260]   that they don't need to sign off on that extension.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:03.300]   I mean, I would assume that it's a natural practice, normal practice for a regulated utility
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:08.960]   to seek recovery of these, you know, unrecovered revenues.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:15.920]   I mean, can you give us a sense, you know, how you see it in Connecticut given the latest,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.240]   you know, legislative changes and also some deterioration and, you know,
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.520]   negative relationships in the state?
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:31.920]   >> Yes. So we are not doing shutoffs across all any of our franchises at this point
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.220]   and specifically, you know, we're working, you know, we're working with customers.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:44.100]   We're working with fuel agencies, assistance agencies on an approach here that works --
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.520]   that works best for customers.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:53.920]   We've also engaged with Pora, as you mentioned, and other government officials, you know, on this issue.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.400]   So I'm confident that we'll get to a good place here.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.360]   You know, nobody wants to burden customers with any more than we're all ready --
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:10.160]   all of us are burdened with in terms of the economic conditions and COVID, et cetera.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.620]   So we're working through the issue, we're working with customers, as I say,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:23.920]   and some of the assistance agencies and I'm sure we'll get to a good outcome here.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.520]   >> Very good.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.100]   Thank you.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.600]   >> Thank you, Angie.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.220]   Next question is from Julian from Bank of America.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.160]   Good morning, Julian.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.580]   >> Hey, good morning, team.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.380]   Thanks for the time.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.780]   I hope all of you are doing well and safe with families as well.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.860]   Perhaps just to pick up off of -- or perhaps clarify, if I can,
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.580]   some of the last rounds of questions.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:51.160]   When you talk about the 4Q roll forward, are you going to be rolling to 2025
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.660]   and then more specifically, how do you think about including
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.580]   or excluding offshore wind in light of the uncertainty described?
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.920]   Should we expect that offshore wind should continue to be at least for those projects
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:08.080]   where there's an undetermined date to continue to be excluded there?
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.580]   >> Julian, thanks for your question and your comments
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.020]   and I hope you and your family are doing well too.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:21.860]   Just to clarify, we will -- our history has been to add another year into the outlook.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:28.020]   So 2025 would be that year since our forecast goes through the 2024 time period
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.660]   so that is something that you should expect to see.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.260]   And really our view on how to look at offshore wind,
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:42.860]   it doesn't change by any of the schedule items we talked about today or if we've looked
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:49.660]   at it as showing the core business as the driver
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.120]   and the foundational element of the growth rate.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.120]   And then to show that wind is additive to that in what way.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.560]   So that would be the intent going forward.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:07.860]   I think that what I've been asked this question before, the answer is was
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:15.160]   and still is as more years of wind come in to the actual results of that particular year
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.160]   than to me it makes more sense to roll it all together.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:25.820]   But at this stage the expectation, especially in this upcoming February update would be
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:37.820]   to have the core business extend that through 2025 and then show offshore wind in addition to that.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.560]   >> And if you don't mind elaborating a little bit further,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.920]   I know that there's a certain degree of uncertainty on exactly the permings schedule
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.420]   that inhibits your ability to say when these project's in a return service.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.760]   Can you at least try to put some more parameters around what each
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.080]   of these pieces of the process could take such that there's like a window if you will?
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.860]   It may be too early.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:09.420]   >> Yeah. So in terms of, you know, people have realized out there and we've been asked questions.
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:16.120]   I think you've asked us the questions in terms of, you know, with delays on vineyard wind
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:23.560]   and other things, there's been some delays in terms of bone notice of intent
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.260]   to prepare their environmental impact statement and frankly,
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:36.120]   we would have expected in our original schedule schedules that some of these NOIs,
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:41.420]   you know, to prepare the environmental impact statement would be out by now.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:47.420]   So these are expected, I believe, you know, the planned schedule for reviewing
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.320]   and releasing these is underway.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.780]   So I wouldn't expect, you know, a significant change in the schedule,
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:02.660]   but at this stage it would be prudent to wait to see the schedule that comes
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:08.720]   out of the bone before we commit to a final inservice date.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.200]   I wouldn't expect it to be significant.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.240]   >> Got it, excellent.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.360]   All right, I'll pass it from there.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.600]   Thank you so much.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.240]   Steve?
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.900]   >> Thanks, Julian.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.120]   Next question is from Durgash from Evercore.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.520]   Good morning, Durgash.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.920]   >> Hey, good morning guys.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.520]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:34.400]   Just following up on, you know, the offshore wind here, what do you expect,
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:40.200]   you know, there's this EIS decision, I suppose, that is going to be out for EIS tape
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.920]   and rather this month or early December, what do you expect there
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:51.000]   and then how does that impact your future project timelines?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   >> Yeah, the -- you've noticed a bit of intense that they contain a planned schedule,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.120]   you know, that in the NOIs they have contained bones planned schedule
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.240]   for reviewing each of the cops.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:10.320]   So that would be an important piece of information to have available.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.640]   So that's really the -- what's included in that is a planned schedule
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.720]   for reviewing the cops that comes out with the notice of intense.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.440]   >> All right, so I guess maybe I'm talking
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.800]   about the environmental impact statement.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.400]   Isn't there an environmental impact statement that bone is supposed
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:34.440]   to sort of put out here in the next few weeks?
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.920]   >> You're talking about the one for Vineyard, right?
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.480]   >> Yes, yes, yes.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.120]   >> Oh, okay, yeah, I'm not --
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:48.800]   I apologize, you probably have to ask Vineyard Windon about that.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.680]   >> Okay, but that doesn't have a read through for you
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.280]   or your offshore wind project, but I guess that's sort of what my question was.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.760]   >> Well, certainly all of the developers off the coast, you know,
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:07.440]   we've been going through this cumulative impact study and looking
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:14.120]   at spacing and of wind turbines and we came up with one nautical mile
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.800]   by one nautical mile spacing.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:22.240]   So certainly there could be components that come out in any decision
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.080]   for Vineyard Wind that you'd have to, you know, take a look
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:31.400]   at to see if it has any impacts, you know, to all the developers including us,
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:36.800]   but in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing,
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.520]   I think Vineyard might have a better perspective of that.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.440]   >> Okay, perfect.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.280]   That's all I had guys.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.520]   Thank you so much.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.960]   >> All right, thanks Dorgesh.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.280]   Next question is from Jeremy from JP Morgan.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.480]   Good morning Jeremy.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.720]   >> Good morning, thanks for having me.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.840]   Just wanted to start off with what are the benefits of looping ConEd
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.920]   into the proposed sunrise wind to RFP here?
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.200]   Every source has experience of building transmission
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.600]   and we're curious what additional competitive advantages ConEd provides
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.720]   here to this specific project.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   Can you provide details on potential ownership interests for each entity
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.120]   and does ownership interest change once construction is complete
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.800]   and the project is in service?
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.080]   >> Thanks for your question Jeremy, hope you're doing well.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.280]   I guess I would say on the first part of the question,
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:38.520]   sort of obviously ConEd has local knowledge of New York
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.720]   and their service territory and the network and the operation
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:51.200]   of the transmission and delivery system that are valuable to any party
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.920]   if you're operating in New York so I'd say they bring a knowledge
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:02.480]   and skill set of the area that certainly we don't have
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.760]   as depth of knowledge as they would so a certain skill set there
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.040]   that the local player would bring.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.040]   So in terms of what the components
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:22.240]   of a relationship would be, those things are all to be discussed
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.480]   as we move through but it's certainly beneficial I think
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:38.840]   to the project and have somebody with ConEd skill sets involved.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.600]   >> Got it and as far as potential ownership interest is there any kind
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:47.240]   of thoughts on how that could develop?
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.040]   >> Not at this time, no.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.320]   >> Got it and then will the delay
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.560]   and offshore wind permitting have any impact
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.080]   on the current financing plans?
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.680]   Is it fair to assume the 700 million of equity
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.880]   in your current private plan moves to the back end here
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:08.000]   and how is offshore wind catbacks spending track Peter Day versus the 300
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.440]   to 400 million range that you expected?
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.760]   >> We haven't disclosed a range that we've expected.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.640]   We've talked about how much we expected to spend, you know,
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.520]   this year, you know, you know, just for the year 2020
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.880]   and it's tracking somewhat close
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.320]   that I'd say it's probably a little bit under what we expected
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:40.680]   at this time, in terms of the financing, you're right
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.040]   that we announced a year ago, you know, the 2 billion dollars
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.000]   of equity need that would support the forecast
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.440]   and we issued 1.3 of that so there's 700 million remaining
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.240]   that and I would say the same thing as I've said all along
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.840]   as we'd be opportunistic and consider what our capital forecast
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.960]   are and what the market conditions are, you know,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.120]   as we look to fulfill the rest
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.920]   of that offering that we discussed.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   >> Got it, that's helpful.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.520]   I'll leave it there.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.600]   Thank you.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.360]   >> Okay, thanks Jeremy.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.920]   Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.600]   Good morning Paul.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.040]   >> Good morning guys.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.560]   >> Good morning Paul.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.800]   I just wanted to follow up on the draft decision in Connecticut
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.640]   on Monday and what your thoughts were on it, any,
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.680]   if it were in fact to become a final order,
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.880]   what the potential impact could be.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.800]   >> Are you talking about the draft information on rates
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.840]   or can you be more specific?
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   >> Sure, there was a draft decision on Monday
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.280]   in the PERA case associated with the rates, right,
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.120]   the rate review that was reversed,
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.720]   that proceeding I can tell you the specific name.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.520]   >> No, that's okay.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.360]   You know, I just wanted to be specific
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.760]   because as somebody else mentioned
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.920]   there's been a number of different--
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.920]   >> Yeah, I can measure a lot.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:30.480]   >> So this-- so as you recall the purest suspended the rates
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.920]   that we had implemented over the summer both we
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.640]   and UI to take an additional look,
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.440]   I think this is what you're referring to.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.240]   So we did receive the draft order
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.200]   and really it's kind of hot off the press
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.600]   we're currently evaluating that
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.160]   and we're going to, you know, see what comments we might have
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.800]   and comments on the draft could do.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.960]   I think it's the 12th of November
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.120]   so we have some time to flush out anything
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.960]   but it's consistent with--
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:07.280]   on first flush I'd say it's consistent with the purest desire
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.360]   to have some rate changes, you know,
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.960]   instead of implementing rates at peak times of usage
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.200]   maybe such as July implement the month,
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.760]   you know, change the timing of it to implement it
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:25.080]   maybe in a-- in a shoulder month like May or something
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.400]   and move to annual reconciliations
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.320]   as opposed to semi-annual.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.880]   So this would, you know, it is delay if this could have--
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.560]   effectively this is a cash flow item
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.040]   and it could have an impact on our deferrals
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.000]   that we have in place there but, you know,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.040]   I think it generally consistent with the desire
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.840]   as we said to move off of these peak periods
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.160]   for making rate changes into shoulder periods
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.800]   and see who we go from there
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.240]   but we're actively reviewing that last night and today
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.480]   and we'll be-- and have any comments
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.600]   that we would have would do as I said on the 12th.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.200]   Okay.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.760]   There was one part of it that would reduce the carrying charges
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.120]   from the-- from lack to a prime rate
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:21.520]   on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.720]   Is there any-- do we have any--
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.200]   I know this is off the press and everything
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.240]   but do we have any sort of forecast as to what the--
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.480]   those reconciliation mechanisms like how much capital
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.680]   might be tied up in those?
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.880]   No, but you did-- that is a point too.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:47.480]   The carrying cost at prime, which is consistent
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.440]   in some of the jurisdictions, I guess.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:55.320]   So, no, it's not the significant, you know, item
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.800]   but it's certainly one that Pure had put out there
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.840]   in the draft is to recover the deferred balances
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:08.240]   with a prime rate versus a lack.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:13.040]   Okay. And then just we don't know who the president's
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.600]   going to be at same, but if there was a change
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.200]   in administration do you think that could have
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.840]   or not have maybe a significant impact
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:29.960]   on the BOEM permitting process with respect to offshore wind?
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.560]   The permitting process, I mean, when we meet
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:40.240]   with BOEM, you know, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.800]   you know, that people are active, we're actively working,
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.280]   we're actively having, you know, Zoom meetings or team calls
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:56.440]   or whatever the video capabilities are that we're using.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.680]   But, you know, we're actively working that
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.360]   and I can assure you that the people in the agencies
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.440]   are working full speed regardless of, you know,
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.880]   who's, you know, president or what the election results are,
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.440]   but certainly it would be good to have, you know,
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.360]   the results of the election, I think we've all,
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:21.600]   as a country, you know, that the election results
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.720]   are something that we've all targeted out there
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.800]   and wherever you fall on the political spectrum
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.960]   it's good to have certainty as opposed to uncertainty.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.440]   So I think we're all looking forward
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.120]   to what the final outcome is there so we can move forward.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.320]   Okay. So for my clarity, the process
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.120]   of the BOEM is pretty much the agency,
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.760]   the sort of bureaucratic process that's going on.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.000]   Really, you don't see a significant change
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.720]   one way or the other regardless of the outcome
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:53.960]   of the presidential election.
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.880]   Is that the right understanding there?
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.960]   Yeah, I'd say that the work at the agencies is going on, you know,
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.840]   there, you know, we've been meeting regularly going through
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:10.400]   questions, we're working through the various state agencies,
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.680]   so no, I'd say that the work is continuing
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.400]   at the, as you say, the bureaucrat level.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.560]   Okay, awesome.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.760]   Thanks so much.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.200]   You're welcome. Thanks Paul.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.760]   Next question is from Mike Weinstein
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.760]   from Credit Suisse. Good morning Mike.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.360]   Hey, good morning Phil.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.240]   Good morning Mike.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.560]   All right, good. I hope you're doing well.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.680]   Hey, maybe you could just give a quick two-second update
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.840]   on what you think the outcome at FERC might be
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:47.760]   for transmission ROEs, you know, considering I don't know
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.600]   if the election outcome maybe has any effect on any
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:56.280]   of this accelerating an outcome?
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.280]   Well Mike, that's a very big crystal ball
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.480]   that you're asking.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:05.960]   So, but again, thanks and I hope you're doing well.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.640]   Thanks for your question.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:12.840]   You know, it's, I wish I had a, you know, a better answer
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.840]   than to say that, you know, it's working its way through.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:25.840]   We don't really have a specific clarity as to when FERC might,
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.320]   you know, come up with something on the New England before
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.840]   pending New England cases and certainly impact
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.840]   of the election one way or the other,
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.320]   what that could have in terms of commissioners
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.280]   and that type of thing.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.840]   So, you know, the only thing I know for certain
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:49.840]   is we're looking at our 10.57 rates and I'm reserving
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:55.840]   to that level and an 11.74 cap and, you know,
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.840]   we'll just have to wait and see what the final outcome
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   we'll look at but I don't really have an answer.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.840]   I know in years past when I tried to think that one was coming
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.840]   or it was going a certain way it really hasn't materialized
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.840]   so I think it's best to wait for the final order
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.840]   comes out at this point on board or as it may be.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:24.840]   Right and a bigger crystal ball question would be,
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.840]   you know, I know that Hydro Quebec has a pretty big long-term
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.840]   construction plan for, you know, hydro generation up there
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.840]   and I know that their long-term plan has included lots
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.840]   and lots of northern past type transmission lines.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.840]   You know, do you think there's ever a time at some point
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.840]   where there might be another whack or another go
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.840]   at transmission at some point, you know, a big transmission project?
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:54.840]   I think a lot of that is dependent upon what the states want to get, right?
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.840]   So, these are going to be processes now that are driven
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.840]   by states clean energy policies and the states desire
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:10.840]   to have either offshore wind or solar or hydro in the mix
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:17.840]   so there certainly is a lot of activity at the states now.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:24.840]   I mean the states in our area all want aggressive carbon reduction targets
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:30.840]   so we wouldn't be asked a question to see a state want to contract
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.840]   for more of that but there's nothing planned on our end
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.840]   and there's nothing that I see at this stage on the states agenda
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   that would say that but when you say the word ever,
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   you know, that's a long time.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   So it seems like the offshore wind program really has kind of planted
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.840]   that at least at the time being.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:55.840]   Yeah, I think that's a good way of looking at it.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   Okay, great.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.840]   Okay, Mike.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   Thanks Mike.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.840]   Our next question is from Insu Kim from Goldman Sachs.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.840]   Good morning Insu.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.840]   Good morning guys.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.840]   My only question is and apologies if I miss this
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.840]   but could you give just an update on the Connecticut grid mock filings
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.840]   and any updates on expected decisions from the commission
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:21.840]   and timing of investments, et cetera?
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.840]   Thanks for your question Insu and I hope you and your family are doing well.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.840]   You didn't miss it.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:32.840]   I mentioned, you know, in terms of what items could be additive
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.840]   to our 5% to 7% core business growth rate,
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.840]   I alluded to grid mod in Connecticut or New Hampshire
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:48.840]   or potentially additional AMI dockets in Massachusetts.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.840]   But there's really been no change there.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   All the parties filed comments and plans back in July
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:01.840]   and certainly you can understand there's been a lot going on
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.840]   and I think I may have said ECIS was in October
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.840]   but we all know that ECIS was in August.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.840]   So since August there's been a lot of, you know,
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.840]   there's been a lot of focus on storms and there's been a lot of dockets
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.840]   and as somebody else mentioned we have dockets going on
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.840]   in terms of moratoriums and whatnot.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:30.840]   So this, you know, the expectation was there was going to be another sort of go round
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.840]   and another process in Connecticut towards the end of the year.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:40.840]   I really haven't seen anything that would indicate a specific schedule, you know,
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.840]   on that so I guess our best guess is still, you know,
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:50.840]   it's still in the pipeline and you may see more activity on grid mod there
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   in Connecticut as we move over the next several months.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.840]   But in terms of being in our forecast, you know,
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   we want to be clear that there is currently no, you know, zero,
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:10.840]   there's no grid mod spending in our capital forecast for any, you know, grid mod programs
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.840]   that haven't been approved like in Connecticut or New Hampshire.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:21.840]   So, you know, once they are approved and once we see what our role would be in them
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:25.840]   and once we see what that, you know, looks like then we have more confidence
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:30.840]   in putting in the plan so that could be something we have information on
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:34.840]   by the time we get to the February update.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   So, you know, we'll have to stay tuned on that.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.840]   That makes sense.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.840]   That's all I had.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.840]   Thank you guys and stay safe.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.840]   Thank you.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   All right, you do.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   Thanks, Andrew.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.840]   Next question is from David Arkaro from Morgan Stanley.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   Morning, David.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.840]   Morning.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.840]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:53.840]   Hi, Phil.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.840]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.840]   Thanks.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   And a quick follow-up on offshore wind, you know, in light of some of the recent delays,
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   I was wondering if that changes how you're strategizing around other bids
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:13.840]   that you're putting into future RFPs, like baking in more contingency,
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.840]   anything that might give a greater level of comfort
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.840]   around the economic future project that you might win.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:25.840]   Thank you, David, for your comment and I hope you and me are doing well.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:31.840]   Certainly, every piece of information that you get, you know,
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:36.840]   and this isn't just offshore wind, you know, this is, you know, on all our business,
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.840]   but I'll focus on offshore wind since that's the question.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.840]   You know, every month it goes by, every quarter it goes by,
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   we gain more insight and information about construction, about, you know,
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   rates about, you know, lots of factors.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:59.840]   If all of those things, all of those things are factored into subsequent bids,
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   so the information that we have available to us, you know, as we're moving into a bid,
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.840]   a recent bid in New York is different than we had from bids that we made, you know,
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.840]   in Rhode Island or Connecticut or Massachusetts.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:18.840]   So every data point is important to us and we factor that into the next bid.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:26.840]   So I'd say that absolutely that schedules and how you make it through the siting process
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:31.840]   and all of that informs, you know, subsequent bids
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:41.840]   and so I can assure you that all those things get, you know, up to the minute attention before bid goes in.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   Okay, got it. That's helpful and I just wanted to touch on just O&M costs and the O&M budget.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:54.840]   Could you remind us how you see that trajectory just for the overall business going forward?
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   You've got a great track record of controlling O&M.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:08.840]   So what are the key levers in your tool belt that you would focus on going forward for managing O&M?
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.840]   Certainly, you know, we've got people processing technology, right?
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:20.840]   So all those things are levers to help, you know, our capital program as well as our operating program.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:30.840]   So, you know, we continue to implement systems and technology that improves processes
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:34.840]   that makes it more efficient and effective work for us.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:43.840]   So we have, you know, still a robust, I'd say, series of technology improvements.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.840]   I'll start off by just setting the space.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:53.840]   In the guidance we gave, we said that we expected O&M costs to be, you know, down this year
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:59.840]   and then just for the forecast period kind of flat going forward.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:06.840]   So how are we able to do that? It is by some of these technology changes
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.840]   and we've been implementing more productivity management tools
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.840]   and tools for our, you know, individual line workers and gas bidders
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.840]   and in the field to get their work, to update their work
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.840]   that we can then take that and automatically update drawings and files.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:29.840]   We don't need, you know, to hand it off to somebody.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:33.840]   So there's still these productivity technology changes that are happening.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:38.840]   Some went in last year, some are going in this year and more plan for next.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:44.840]   So that will be, I'd say, the lever underpinning for us
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:53.840]   to have the ability to continue to improve processes and take unneeded costs out of the business.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:56.840]   Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you so much for the call.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   You're welcome.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:58.840]   Thank you, David.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.840]   Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   Good morning, Travis.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.840]   Good morning. Thank you.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.840]   Quick clarification on the storm cost.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:13.840]   That $275 million number, if I heard you correctly.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.840]   How much did you expense in the quarter
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   and how much was either deferred or capitalized
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:26.840]   or will be pending the regulatory filing that you mentioned?
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:32.840]   Travis, that amount that you repeated was deferred.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.840]   That's how much of a storm cost that we deferred
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.840]   for tropical storm Isaias,
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:46.840]   and that was across all states but primarily in Connecticut.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.840]   So that's our deferral.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:53.840]   Once the storm gets to a certain level, it triggers a deferral.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:59.840]   So that fall is deferred storm cost right now.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.840]   In terms of -- there are other storms.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.840]   Certainly we had an active quarter for storms in general,
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.840]   but there are other storms other than Isaias that did impact the quarter.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:17.840]   I mean, our storm costs were up about $10 million for the quarter
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.840]   that went through our O&M.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.840]   So for the quarter, it's at that level,
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:31.840]   and then the 274 or 5 that you mentioned is deferred across the system.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.840]   Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.840]   And then a quick follow-up to the discussion on the Connecticut legislation,
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   and there's some language in there, as I understood it,
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.840]   about the general assembly having some review power there.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.840]   What's your thought in terms of the scope
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.840]   of what the general assembly, separate from Pura,
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.840]   could do in terms of either taking back some earnings
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.840]   or rate changes, stuff like that,
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.840]   separate from what's going on in the Pura?
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.840]   Well, certainly the general assembly can enact legislation
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.840]   that it feels is appropriate in any matter.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.840]   So, you know, I do think specifically to the energy legislation
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.840]   that was enacted recently in Connecticut
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:27.840]   that most, you know, things all were, you know,
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.840]   for the most part moved to Pura, you know, so the regulator.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.840]   So I guess I'd look at it as the legislation would provide
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.840]   the intent, the framework, the direction,
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.840]   and then Pura is the one who's going to be implementing,
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.840]   you know, they're going to be the ones
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.840]   who evaluate the performance-based rates.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.840]   They'll be the ones who initiate the storm standards
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.840]   and things like that and look at, you know,
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   should there be penalties or should there be food,
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.840]   you know, penalties and things like that.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.840]   So I think that effectively, you know,
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.840]   the general assembly can certainly enact
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.840]   any and all legislation it feels it should
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   and the way that this legislation seems to have turned out
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.840]   was that any implementation of that legislation
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.840]   is in the hands of Pura.
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.840]   Okay, so the potential for any or the risk
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.840]   for any kind of clawbacks would likely go through Pura
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.840]   instead of go through the general assembly
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.840]   based on that kind of legislation that you talked about.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.840]   Yeah, as I say, you know, the Pura,
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.840]   the dockets are active and will be active over,
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.840]   you know, there's a certain time date
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.840]   that the legislation has given Pura,
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.840]   so I would expect that Pura will have the pen on this.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.840]   But again, as I say, you know,
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:01.840]   legislation can always be enacted in any area.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.840]   Yep, okay, great, appreciate it.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.840]   All right, thank you Travis.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.840]   Our next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.840]   Good morning, Andrew.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.840]   Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.840]   First question is, with the two rate cases now completed,
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.840]   can you remind us which subsidiaries might be next
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.840]   to file general rate cases?
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.840]   We have plenty of regulatory items, of course,
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:35.840]   grid mod and other initiatives, but for general rate cases?
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:40.840]   Well, according to the requirements in Connecticut,
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.840]   Connecticut could be an area that is required to file
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.840]   by the existing framework that's there.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.840]   And that would be something that would be sort of a,
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.840]   you know, next year sort of event,
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:03.840]   but other than that, we're pretty much out of the regulatory arena.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.840]   Okay, great.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.840]   Then on offshore wind, can you just thinking,
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   sorry, can you share your latest thinking
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.840]   on how big you're willing to let that business get?
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.840]   You talked a lot about the opportunities
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.840]   that you're pursuing beyond the three existing projects.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.840]   Any thinking as far as from an earnings mix perspective,
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.840]   there's a limitation or will you plan to just bid bid bid
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.840]   and get as many projects as your leases will support?
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.840]   Well, I want to be clear on this because I think
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.840]   it's a very important point that bid bid isn't our strategy.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.840]   Our strategy is to have a financial discipline
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.840]   about growing that business in a way
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   that provides appropriate levels of return
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.840]   that benefit our shareholders.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.840]   So just by winning a bid, you know, doesn't do it.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.840]   It has to be, we have to and we continue to maintain
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.840]   financial discipline in terms of the amounts that we bid
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.840]   and the returns that we're looking for.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.840]   So as long as the returns are at an appropriate level
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.840]   for that business, it makes sense to make the bid,
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.840]   win the bid and expand the business there.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:25.840]   What we've said is our tracks, what we own off the coast
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.840]   of what we have access to in terms of the lease area,
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.840]   we could do about 4,000, at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:39.840]   So there's kind of a, you know, that's the maximum capability
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:44.840]   that we have so it's not an infinite growth type of thing
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.840]   and we had indicated that when leases were available
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:52.840]   that are not in our region that we were not interested in them.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.840]   So leases in our region, like the ones we're involved in are good
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.840]   but other lease areas, you know, that's not for us
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.840]   in other parts of the mid-Atlantic, et cetera.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.840]   So we're constrained by the lease area
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.840]   and we're guided by the financial discipline
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:15.840]   on our bids and our returns.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.840]   >> God, that's really helpful. I guess I should have said bid, bid, bid responsibly.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.840]   >> Okay.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.840]   >> Thanks a lot guys.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:30.840]   >> All right, Andrew, thank you very much.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.840]   That sort of wraps up today.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.840]   If you have any follow-up questions please give us a call
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.840]   or send us an e-mail and we look forward to speaking
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.840]   and seeing many of you during the virtual EEI conference next week.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:51.840]   And thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.840]   Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.840]   >> Thank you.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SAG Third Quarter 2020
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.340]   Earnings Conference Call.
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.140]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.540]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at the
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.540]   time.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.220]   If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.220]   touchtone telephone.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.820]   As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.820]   Thank you.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.500]   I would like to turn the conference over to your house.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.380]   Mr. Brandon Frey, please go ahead.
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.140]   Thank you, Grace.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.360]   Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review SAG's Third Quarter 2020 financial
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.360]   results.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.060]   On the call today, we have Krista Hearn, Chief Executive Officer and Taylor Smith, Chief Financial
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.060]   Officer.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.000]   Following Krista and Taylor's prepared comments, we will open the call for a question and answer
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   session.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.360]   Our Third Quarter Earnings Press Release was issued today after the market closed at
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.640]   approximately 4.05 pm Eastern Time.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.700]   As a follow-on to the earnings release, we published a supplemental financial information
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.880]   on our Investor Relations website.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.660]   We also furnished this document to the SEC on Formation.
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.360]   You can find all our earnings documents on our Investor Relations website at zag.com in
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.700]   the quarterly results section under the financial tab.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.720]   We are recording this call and a podcast with a conference call will be archived at the Zag
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.120]   Investor Relations webpage under the Events tab for one year.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.360]   Before we begin, we would like to remind everyone that the prepared remarks contain forward-looking
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.560]   statements and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   questions.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.080]   These statements include, but are not limited to, our outlook for the company and statements
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.920]   that estimate or project future results of operations for the performance of the company.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.080]   These statements do not guarantee future performance and speak as of the date hereof.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.360]   For more detailed discussion on the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.040]   from those projected in the forward-looking statements, we refer all of you to the risk factors contained
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.720]   in Zag's annual report on Form 10(k) and quarterly reports on Form 10(q) by the Securities Exchange
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.720]   Commission.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.600]   Zag assumes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements that may be made in today's release
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   or call.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.680]   Please note that on today's call, in addition to discussing the GAP financial results, we
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.080]   will discuss adjusted EBITDA on non-GAP financial measure.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.300]   Expiration of Zag's use of this non-GAP financial measure in this call and reconciliation between
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.560]   GAP and non-GAP measures required by SEC Regulation G is included in Zag's press release today,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.040]   which again can be found on the Investor Relations website.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.480]   The non-GAP information is not a substitute for any performance measure derived in accordance
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.120]   with GAP and the use of such non-GAP measures has limitations, which are detailed in the
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.640]   company's press release.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.840]   And now I'm going to turn the call over to Chris Taverna.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840]   Chris?
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.360]   Thanks, Brendan, and thank you to everyone on today's call.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.640]   We hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.800]   Firstly, let me start by thanking our entire Zag team across the globe.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.120]   I'm extremely proud to see how our teams reacted through the quarter and never last sight of
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.280]   serving our consumers and partners with quality products that protect and enhance their devices.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.360]   Over the course of the third quarter, it was pleasing to see our results improve significantly
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.000]   compared with the second quarter and exceed our expectations.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.520]   We are encouraged by our recent performance given the challenges we continue to face from
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.600]   the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.080]   Our work over the past several months, which has included reducing expenses, adapting our
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.360]   operations to the current retail environment and aggressively managing inventories has put
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.040]   the company in a much stronger financial position and provided the business with good momentum
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.320]   as we head into our busiest selling season.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.080]   Looking at our third quarter in more detail, as we discussed on our Q2 call in August, we
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.840]   saw a significant sequential uptick in sales through in June for both our protection and
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.640]   power categories as several of our larger customers reopened our doors and resumed more normalized
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.760]   store operations, with some sales through weeks even exceeding last year's levels.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.560]   This trend continued into July and consistently improved throughout August and September.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   While our online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced earlier in the
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.040]   pandemic, when much of the brick and mortar was closed, it was still up nicely from a
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.280]   year ago and expanding this channel continues to be a priority for us.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.640]   With respect to our overall performance, Q3 revenue came in at $150 million compared to
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.680]   $147 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 21%.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.320]   This represents a nice improvement from the 28% year-over-year decrease in revenue we reported
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.000]   in the second quarter.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.960]   Despite the roughly $32 million drop in revenue compared with the third quarter last year
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.080]   combined with some gross margin headwinds from higher freight expenses, we delivered a
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.120]   adjusted EBIT of $15 million.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.320]   Thanks to cost saving measures we enacted early in the pandemic, Taylor will go through in
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.480]   greater detail on the balance sheet but I wanted to share a few highlights.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.760]   Despite significant market pressure from COVID-19, our account receivable DSO has improved compared
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.440]   to last year, inventory declined compared to where we ended Q2, we generated positive
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.960]   operating cash flow and we continue to reduce our quarterly net-dead balance on a year-over-year
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.520]   and sequential basis.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.480]   By taking quick decisive action back in April and more recently working closely with our
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.160]   retail partners under store reopening efforts, we have been able to successfully navigate
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.120]   through incredibly challenging market conditions, ensuring the financial viability of the company
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.360]   and position ourselves to exit this difficult period as a stronger, more nimble organization.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.720]   I now provide some additional color to our categories.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.840]   Starting with protection, we continue to build on our overall digital wellness strategy for
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.440]   a few years now our hero screen protector has been VisionGuard, a product that reduces exposure
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.480]   to high energy visible blue light that can have damaging effects without changing the screen
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.000]   colors or the peak resolution.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.920]   We have now sold over 10 million units with this technology.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.560]   In addition, all invisible sheen screen protectors produced this year and beyond now also include
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.400]   antimicrobial technology.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.120]   This includes our entire lineup for the new iPhone 12 which is now available in stores.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.600]   Earlier this year, we introduced our newest product geared towards our digital wellness
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.520]   strategy, a UV phone sanitizer which works with all mobile devices and kills up to 99.9%
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.040]   of staff in E. coli surface bacteria.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.840]   Our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retailers and our
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.480]   consumers and has led to increasing sales through and greater shelf space with many of our accounts.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.280]   We've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to protect cases with good success,
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.880]   starting with the Samsung Galaxy S20 launch earlier this year and right through to the recent
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.560]   iPhone 12 launch.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.720]   All Gear 4 protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.760]   The combination of disenhancement, benefit and Gear 4's differential D3O impact technology
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.000]   is driving excitement amongst consumers especially as awareness of the brand and product scroll
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.560]   from our efforts to expand distribution.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   With the new iPhone 12, Gear 4 is now available and growing across all of our carrier partners.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.240]   This expanded distribution accelerates to momentum in Gear 4 brand and I'm excited to see it continue
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.040]   to grow through 2021.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.120]   In our power category, Mofi launched many exciting new products during Q3 including the introduction
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.800]   of a new line of wireless charging solutions.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.720]   These innovations are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple devices
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.840]   in one central location.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.460]   In addition, last month we launched the new Mofi Juice Pack Connect.
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.960]   This new product represents an evolution of our popular juice pack allowing users to easily
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.000]   charge their phone on demand using a detachable battery feature that is not device specific
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.560]   and is used with or without the consumer's normal phone case.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.500]   Our Halo brand continues to perform well on QVC which has been a productive partnership
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.600]   and channel particularly given the number of consumers spending more time at home.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   Q4 is a busy time for our brands with QVC and HSN with a number of airings planned during
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.700]   the holiday periods.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.480]   Looking ahead with the majority of our U.S. partner doors now open and weekly sales will
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.880]   continue to improve combined with solid direct-to-consumer trends, we feel optimistic about our prospects
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.040]   for the remainder of the year.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.200]   While there is still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact shopping behavior
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.400]   this holiday season including the effect on several countries in Europe that have recently
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.560]   implemented lockdowns, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on demand regarding
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.280]   the status of which channel our consumers choose to engage with the brands.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.680]   We are currently planning four quarter revenue to increase from third quarter levels and continue
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.800]   improving on the year over year declines we have experienced the past two quarters even as we
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.400]   are facing tough comparisons to last year's record Q4 sales.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   I am confident in the long-term course we have set for the company.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.120]   Our efforts around antimicrobial UV sanitization and blue light protection are driven by our
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.760]   belief that consumers will increasingly look for solutions that will hench their digital
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.760]   wellness.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.760]   We also believe another consumer priority will be increased productivity and comfort from
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   home.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.320]   We will continue our focus on enhancing technology in our lives to accomplish these growing needs.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.480]   While it remains difficult to know when conditions will fully normalize and what impact COVID-19
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.280]   will have on the global economy and our industry, I am confident that we have taken the right
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.800]   steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.680]   This includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin product and categories and simplify
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   our core lines of business.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.840]   As a more nimble company, Zag can better serve its retail partners and core consumers, capitalize
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.000]   on the tailwinds from the multi-year rollout of 5G with the margin benefits from our branding
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.920]   category consolidation and generate increased value for our shareholders.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.120]   I will now hand the call over to Taylor.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   Thanks Chris.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.400]   Since many details of our quarterly financial performance were included in the supplemental
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.280]   financial information issued earlier today, I would just like to take a few minutes to
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.680]   add some additional comments on our third quarter financial performance.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:53.320]   Q3 net sales decreased year over year by approximately 21% to $115 million.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.600]   After exiting a very difficult second quarter, we saw good momentum throughout the third
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.440]   quarter as retail outlets continued to reopen and allow a more normal in-store shopping
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.440]   experience.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.480]   That being said, the residual effects of COVID-19 combined with the delay of the launch
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.280]   of the new Apple devices, which pushed some orders into Q4, made it a difficult year-over-year
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.280]   compare.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.200]   Overall, we're pleased with the momentum and sell through improvements we saw at retail,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.920]   which enabled us to increase sales by almost 50% on a consecutive quarter basis from $77
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.280]   million to $115 million.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.360]   Q3 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased year over year to 33%.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.120]   There were a number of puts and takes that impacted gross profit during the quarter, including
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.160]   a benefit from net lower duty rates and expected duty refunds, which I'll discuss in more detail
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.360]   in a second.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:47.320]   This benefit was offset by higher expedited air freight and increased air freight rates,
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.520]   along with the sale of excess inventory at margins that were lower than our historical averages.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.040]   On the subjects of duty refunds, in early August, we received an exclusion notice that duties
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.680]   paid on certain products imported from China starting in late 2018 may be subject to refund.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.000]   We worked closely with our customs broker to begin submitting refund documentation to U.S.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Customs.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.480]   This work is ongoing and given the volume of imports from China since late 2018, we'll
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.580]   continue throughout the fourth quarter.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.200]   Based on the work completed to date, we recorded a refund receivable at quarter end of approximately
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.640]   $5.4 million for duties paid that we expect to be refunded.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.600]   The income statement impacted this receivable offset by the balance sheet reduction from
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.280]   duties previously capitalized in inventory and then sold in Q3 2020 was a net income statement
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.440]   benefit of $1.7 million, or approximately 140 basis points, to gross profit margin during
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.600]   the quarter.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.000]   As I mentioned, there is still quite a bit of work left to do during the fourth quarter
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.040]   to complete our remaining refund submissions and we'll provide an update on any additional
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.280]   refund upside on our next call.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.320]   Q3 operating expenses decreased 29%, or approximately $12 million compared to last year.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.760]   The decrease was due primarily to the various cost-cutting measures we implemented as a result
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.720]   of the expected COVID-19 impacts on demand.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.040]   Over the last several months, we've made the conscious decision to bring some individuals
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.840]   back from furlough to support fourth quarter product launches and customer care, but we
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.080]   continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.080]   time.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:24.060]   Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million vs. $21 million in the prior year period.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.280]   The decline vs. last year is linked to decreased sales and a reduction in overall gross profit
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.240]   margin for the reasons I mentioned.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.120]   These items were offset by the decreases in operating expenses that I just discussed.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.880]   Turning to the balance sheet, compared to a year ago accounts receivable decreased 33%
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.320]   to $91 million due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.980]   However, our DSOs improved significantly from 87 days to 73 days.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.200]   The quality of our receivables remains very good.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.320]   There was $80 million compared to $94 million at the end of the first quarter, a reduction
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.040]   of approximately $14 million.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.020]   During the third quarter, we took a conservative approach to inventory as we closely monitored
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.360]   retail sell-through, customer forecasts and customer inventory levels to ensure we didn't
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.920]   overextend on inventory purchasing.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.320]   As a result, we did incur some incremental expedited air freight charges due to increased
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.720]   demand at the end of the third quarter as retail sell-through improved.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.160]   At this point, we will continue to closely monitor the factors that influence our purchase
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.400]   and forecast but will continue to plan conservatively due to the continued uncertainties related
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.160]   to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.000]   Despite the continued headwinds from COVID-19 during the quarter, we generated a third quarter
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.680]   operating cash flow of approximately $9 million compared to negative $11 million in cash from
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.480]   operations during the prior year period.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.280]   Net debt, which has consolidated debt less cash, decreased to $81 million compared to
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.800]   $97 million in Q3 last year and $85 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.000]   As we discussed on the last call, during April, we amended our credit facility to increase
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   the total amount available into the line of credit from $125 million to $145 million.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.680]   This expansion combined with the loan received under the CARES Act, the Q2 restructuring
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.800]   and cost-cutting initiatives we've undertaken gives us confidence that will successfully
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.160]   navigate the headwinds that COVID-19 has put on the business.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.400]   The capital allocation focus throughout the remainder of 2020 will remain on funding working
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.960]   capital needs and continuing to service our line of credit.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.640]   As we look to the fourth quarter of 2020, we definitely have better visibility now than
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.560]   we did when we last spoke in August.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.560]   However, COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty around worldwide retail demand.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.440]   Given this market uncertainty, we will not be providing annual guidance at this time.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.160]   However, given our current view of customer orders and positive retail sell-through trends,
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.760]   we expect strong sequential net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth over the third quarter.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.960]   We expect 2020 year-to-date gross margins to improve during the fourth quarter, though
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.400]   as I mentioned, we'll see some pressure over the next few quarters compared to historical
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.840]   averages of mid-30s as we sell through our excess inventory.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.600]   We expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high 20s to low $30 million
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   for the fourth quarter.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.800]   No different than from many other companies, COVID-19 has been extremely disruptive to
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   our business.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.680]   However, with the steps we've taken to restructure the business, reduce fixed costs and ensure
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.120]   adequate liquidity, I'm confident the likes of this period impacted by COVID-19 is a much
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.640]   stronger company than when we entered.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.400]   With that, we will now open up the call for questions.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.800]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.040]   If you have a question at this time, please press start in the number one key on your touch-tone
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   telephone.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.680]   Again, that is start in the number one key on your touch-tone telephone.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.200]   Your first question comes from the line of Elliott Alper from DA Davidson.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   Your line is open.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   Great.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   Thank you.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.240]   Thanks for the info on just the sequential sales in the fourth quarter, I guess.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.960]   Could you talk about any trends quarter dates specifically and specifically geographic sales
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   mix?
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.120]   Are you seeing any material changes with sales and geographies that have lost restrictions
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.280]   compared to those that have more?
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:12.240]   Just a couple of notes, with the Apple launch happening a little bit later than we had experienced
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.080]   previously, there was maybe $5 million of sales that shifted from Q3 into Q4, which obviously
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:24.840]   benefit the sequential look at revenue.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.960]   Overall though, we're seeing really good sell through of the phones that seem to be doing
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.600]   very successful in market and obviously we're benefiting from that.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.400]   Q4 is starting off really, really well.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:45.280]   In terms of geos, no material change in geoxpansion, Chris mentioned, or geomics, Chris mentioned
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.280]   on his prepared remarks that we are definitely seeing some headwinds, at least in terms of
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.400]   shutdowns in some of our international locations.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.920]   However, the wireless dealers in those locations have been deemed as essential and so those
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.920]   have remained open.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:06.920]   It remains to be seen as to how that's going to impact demand, but I think overall we're
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:13.600]   definitely seeing some strong signs that we're getting back to a more normal Q4 experience
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:20.920]   though obviously COVID remains a bit of a cloud over everything.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:26.040]   Then aside from the Apple launch shifting into the fourth quarter, can you talk about the
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.840]   holiday season and what may be different this year versus historically and any implications
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.520]   that may have on the December quarter?
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.520]   One thing that we are starting to see is obviously the Black Friday seems to be more, some retailers
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.040]   are taking strategy which are spreading us out over a number of days, over the month, so
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.680]   that's something that's going to be different.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:53.160]   I think we're still going to see a pretty strong online attachment from both side.com and obviously
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:00.600]   through Amazon, but we're very, I would say, optimistic about the early sales through on
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.760]   our screen protection and cases are quite strong and that's given that we still have a number
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:12.560]   of other devices to take the market actually this week, so overall I think we have some
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.840]   good runway for the holiday season earlier.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.080]   Okay great, thank you.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.080]   Thank you.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:27.560]   Once again, in order to ask a question please press start then the number one on your touch
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   tone telephone.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.320]   Your next question comes from the line of Matt Dain from Titan Capital Management, your line
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   is open.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   Great, thank you.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:40.760]   I was hoping you could put a number on the expediting shipping costs that you incurred
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:46.680]   in the third quarter just to give us some better idea on how significant those were?
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:55.360]   Yeah, it was between $2 and $3 million and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it was
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.880]   a bit of a balancing act with inventory where we're trying to run it down and self through,
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.400]   picked up at the end, we didn't have to move quickly and unfortunately resulted in some
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.680]   expedited air freight charges.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:14.260]   For the fourth quarter are you expecting that to reoccur or have you caught up and you feel
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.880]   like you're in a better place now?
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.320]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.880]   I think we're still probably chasing a little bit of demand.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.920]   The one thing that's also impacted us no different than every other company that's importing from
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.840]   overseas is just generally freight rates have increased globally and so that's also impacted
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.840]   it.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.680]   But I think there's probably going to be a little bit of that, as I mentioned it's a bit
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.980]   of a balancing act, we definitely wanted to be careful given the pandemic and how much
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:50.600]   inventory we were planning and unfortunately we've seen some upsides which is great but we've
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.480]   had to chase those and so I think we're probably still chasing a little bit which will impact
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.960]   some of our Q4 sales and then also obviously the spend on freight.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.960]   Great.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:07.120]   I also wanted to ask if I could really quickly about the tariff situation and now with the
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:14.400]   Biden presidency I know you've been moving some production out of China, does that change
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:21.520]   your view on moving production out of China or how are you thinking about this new regime?
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:27.840]   Yeah, I think that it doesn't change our strategy, ultimately we're looking to diversify across
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:34.420]   our CM base and make sure that we're setting the company up for continued business so we're
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:40.080]   still following the strategy and we've had a very good quarter where we've now successfully
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.040]   have piloted both screen protection and wireless power outside of China so it gives us that
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.020]   ability to be able to shift our supply chain when needed.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.880]   Obviously China is still a big part of our strategy but what I like is we're not just looking
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.120]   at it from a tariff perspective now, we're really looking at it from a business continuity
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.120]   perspective.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.120]   Great, thank you both, thanks Matt.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.940]   Thanks Matt.

[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.200]   touch down telephone.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:26.900]   Gentlemen, I'm showing you for the question at this time I would like to turn the conference
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.940]   back to Mr Chris in hearing from any closing remarks.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.880]   Thank you and thank everybody for joining our Q3 earnings report, we look forward to updating

[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.360]   Thank you all for joining him and I'll disconnect.
