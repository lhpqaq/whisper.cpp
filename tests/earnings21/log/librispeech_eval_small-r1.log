[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monroe Inc. Earnings Conference Call
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.860]   for the third quarter fiscal 2020.
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.140]   At this time, all participants are on a listen only mode.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.900]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.900]   time.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.580]   If anyone should require assistance during the call, please press star zero on your touch
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.580]   tone phone.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.300]   As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded and may not be reproduced
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.700]   in whole or in part without permission from the company.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.440]   I would now like to introduce Ms. Maureen Mulholland, Senior Vice President, General
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.700]   Counsel and Secretary Monroe.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.700]   Thank you.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.380]   Please go ahead.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.380]   Thank you.
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.020]   Hello everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's call.
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.220]   Before we get started, please note that as part of the call this morning, we will be referencing
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:01:02.100]   a presentation that is available on the Investors section of our website at corporate.monroe.com/investors/investorresources.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.300]   If I could draw your attention to the Safe Harbor Statement on slide two of the presentation,
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.260]   I'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.300]   looking statements about Monroe's future performance.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.260]   Additional results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.020]   The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monroe's filings
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.940]   with the SEC and in our earnings release.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.300]   The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.540]   whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.540]   law.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.780]   Additionally, on today's call, management statements include a discussion of certain non-GAP financial
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.820]   measures which are intended to supplement and not be substituted for comparable GAP measures.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.180]   Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable GAP measures will be included
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.540]   as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release.
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.280]   With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.780]   Brett Ponton.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.980]   Thank you, Maureen and good morning, everyone.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.980]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.420]   I'll get started today with a brief overview of our third quarter results followed by an
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.740]   update on the progress we've made on our Monroe Forward Strategy.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.820]   As illustrated on slide three, we reported comps down 0.9 percent in the third quarter
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.380]   as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.020]   In October and the beginning of November, we performed well against difficult comparisons
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.860]   in the prior year.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.420]   Mild weather conditions towards the end of November and in December caused a slowdown
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.780]   across our core Northern market.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.740]   These conditions have continued into January with our comparable store sales down 4 percent
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.660]   during the month.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.100]   We do not like talking about the weather; however, it is impossible to ignore the impact it has
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.100]   on our business.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.420]   While we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter, we are executing well
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.300]   against the areas within our control.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.700]   In particular, we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and are confident
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.780]   we are on the right path.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.020]   We are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.100]   deliver strong results no matter the external circumstances.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.700]   To lead on to our performance by category in the third quarter, we were down 1 percent year
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.060]   over year in the entire comparable store sales.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.060]   As higher ticket year over year was offset by a decline in tire volume.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.500]   We experienced more normalized retail pricing this quarter and are focused on further refining
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.980]   our tire strategy to drive strength in our largest category.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.100]   Importantly, we are on track to roll out our tire category management and pricing system
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.100]   beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.540]   approach to real-time pricing.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.940]   I'll provide more details on this shortly.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.380]   Turning to our service and repair categories, we saw a 3 percent decline in brakes year
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.500]   over year, falling short of a difficult comparison in the third quarter last year.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.700]   In maintenance, we were flat while front-end shocks were down 1 percent and alignments
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.420]   decline 3 percent year over year.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.980]   Overall, our southern markets outperformed our northern markets as expected given the mild
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.900]   winter weather conditions we face in this region.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.620]   New stores added $22.7 million in revenue during the quarter, including $20.7 million from
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.860]   recent acquisitions.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.980]   Regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter, we saw a decline of 20 basis
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.540]   points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.140]   store sales, which resulted in higher fixed cost at the percentage of sales.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.300]   Our variable margin, on the other hand, expanded due to lower year over year material cost
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.900]   as a percentage of sales, while slightly higher than the prior year quarter technician
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.380]   labor as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.900]   This is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.020]   We identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.140]   action to drive improved results.
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.260]   We will have additional opportunities to continue to improve results in this area as we implement
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.740]   our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year,
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.140]   which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust the changes in demand dynamics without
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.780]   sacrificing sales.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.460]   I now like to turn to the progress we've made in our Monroe Forward Strategy beginning with
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.220]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative on slide four.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.060]   This initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.700]   standardized in-store operating procedures, which we call our Monroe Playbook.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.100]   Additionally, we are rebranding select stores to a tire oriented banner where targeted
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.700]   demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.060]   service revenues.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.380]   During the first half of fiscal 2020, we finalized the transformations of our first group of stores
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.940]   which includes 44 locations in Rochester, New York and Mid-Atlantic, as well as the second
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.180]   group which includes 43 stores in our southern market.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.620]   During the third quarter, we continue to scale this initiative across our base and move forward
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.780]   with the transformation of 74 stores in four markets and 42 of our recently acquired California
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.420]   stores.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.020]   We have completed the transformation of the 74 stores and have substantially completed our
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.900]   California stores which are being rebranded under our Tire Choice Auto Service Center
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.020]   banner to drive higher awareness for tires.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.500]   Turning to slide five, I'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.220]   rationale as we transform our store base.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.540]   As many of you know, we operate in two store formats.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.780]   Our service brand stores which generate approximately $600,000 per store in annualized sales and our
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:27.020]   tire brand stores which generate approximately $1.2 million per store in annualized sales.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:33.580]   Prior to any rebrand activity, we operated 555 service brand stores and 734 tire brand
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.580]   stores.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:40.180]   As we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores, we are prioritizing
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.980]   the higher volume tire brand.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.020]   Throughout this process, we will be consolidating our regional brands focusing on shifting our
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.260]   service brands over the tire brand.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.980]   The lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:01.260]   When we speak to re-imaging stores, this primarily means modernizing the appearance of our stores
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.900]   with no associated brand change.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.020]   As we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re-imaging stores, we are leveraging
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.300]   our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:20.180]   Looking at the bottom left of the slide, you can see here the progress we have made so far.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.540]   We are very much in the early innings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.060]   completed out of our portfolio.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.620]   We separated these stores out between comp stores and non-comp stores which helps us to
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.900]   evaluate their performance post refresh.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:42.580]   Of our approximately 900 comp stores that we set out to transform, we've completed 134
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:49.260]   stores and of our approximately 150 non-comp stores, we've substantially completed 69.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.100]   As we move forward with expanding this program across our base, we will continue to prioritize
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.780]   markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and our approach
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.620]   will be measured in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum.
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.540]   Through the end of this fiscal year, we are focusing on finalizing the transformation
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.900]   of our recently acquired California stores while starting the transformation of approximately
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.460]   80 more stores that will be completed in Q1 of FY21.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.380]   Moving on to the performance of the stores we've completed so far to help provide some
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.820]   additional granularity, we separated out how rebranded stores have performed versus the
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.540]   stores that have just been re-imaged.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:37.140]   Importantly, this data only includes comp stores that have had a full quarter of performance
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.260]   following the completion of their transformation.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:48.780]   This is how we will speak to this performance of our transformed stores moving forward.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:54.500]   As you can see and in line with our expectations, we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   stores.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:01.740]   This shift optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sales without sacrificing
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.860]   our service revenues.
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.740]   The stores that have been re-imaged were slightly down as these are located in our northern
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.060]   markets, which were impacted by the mild weather conditions I mentioned earlier.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.180]   We believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.580]   to come with a streamlined brand portfolio.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.820]   The 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation, given
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:34.420]   they have not had a full quarter post-transformation yet, but we are seeing early signs of strength
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.580]   to these stores and are pleased with the results.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.900]   While we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base, the sustained
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:48.700]   performance we've seen at the stores that have completed the transformation today underscores
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.180]   the impact of this important initiative.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.860]   Going to slide six and the remainder of our Monroe Forward initiatives, I'd like to focus
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.220]   my discussion on the initiatives that are top priority, which we believe will be critical
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.740]   to supporting our broader strategy.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:10.780]   In the third quarter, we began modernizing our store IT infrastructure at all of our approximately
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.180]   1300 locations.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:18.580]   This new infrastructure enables state-of-the-art technology, including our new digital phone
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:24.580]   and texting system, which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.300]   This system will allow us to better track customer execution, driving a more consistent phone
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.700]   strategy and improved conversion.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.460]   Our store infrastructure modernization will be completed by the end of the first quarter
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.820]   of fiscal 2021, allowing us to leverage our new phone system, which will be critical to
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.020]   driving traffic to our stores.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.340]   Another priority for us is the optimization of our entire category management.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.620]   We are on track and by the end of this fiscal year, we expect our new pricing software will
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.240]   be operational.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.220]   We believe this will be critical to driving long-term margin expansion by providing improved visibility
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.580]   into demand dynamics, allowing us to better refine our assortments and execute our strategy
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.940]   to become the number one destination for tires at any price point.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:17.260]   Finally, we are right on track to roll out our cloud-based store scheduling model pilot
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.260]   by year-end.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:23.580]   Gaining real-time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:29.340]   and strategic, ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales or overstaffed when there
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.340]   is a lack of demand.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.460]   Regarding our other teammate initiatives, we have rolled out the Monroe University program
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.740]   to all of our teammates and are continuing to expand and enhance the course content.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.740]   We have also implemented mandatory onboard training to ensure that everyone who joins our
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:52.380]   team is trained on our Monroe playbook operating procedures in order to provide a quality five-star
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.140]   experience to our customers.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.980]   Moving on to slide seven, while we are very focused on the rollout of Monroe Forward, acquisitions
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.220]   remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy.
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.780]   During the quarter, we closed the previously announced acquisitions of three companies,
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:13.100]   one with 14 locations in Las Vegas, Nevada and four in Boise, Idaho, as well as two companies
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.300]   that include nine stores in Northern California, further solidifying our growing position in
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.460]   the western United States.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.900]   Our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts as well as benefit
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:31.340]   from the high concentration of vehicles in this market and the potential long-term consumership
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.060]   to ride sharing.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.900]   The acquisition in Nevada and Idaho, which are new states to Monroe is expected to add
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:43.940]   approximately 20 million in annualized sales, represented sales mix of 75% service and 25%
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.100]   tires.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.540]   The acquisitions in California are expected to add approximately 25 million in annualized
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:56.380]   sales, represented sales mix of 55% service and 45% tires.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:04.140]   These acquisitions are expected to be diluted to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:09.100]   All acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent and expected
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.540]   120 million in annualized sales.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:18.900]   We operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:25.140]   and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.140]   M&A targets.
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:32.940]   We currently have over 10 NDA signs with opportunities ranging from five to 40 stores, which we believe
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.500]   will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.820]   expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.100]   Further, by continuing to execute our Monroe forward initiatives, including our new brand
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.720]   standards and operating procedures, we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.220]   and efficiently.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:15:00.580]   Lastly, we open one green field location during third quarter, bringing our total green field
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.300]   store openings to seven in fiscal 2020.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.660]   In conclusion, we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in our
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.660]   business.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.700]   We are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.500]   a platform capable of delivering sustainable long term growth.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.460]   We are not there yet, nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.460]   transformation.
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.060]   But we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business, making the
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.900]   appropriate course corrections when necessary, and executing well against the areas within
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.900]   our control.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:41.140]   I'd like to thank the entire team at Monroe for their exceptional work as we execute this
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:46.780]   strategy, as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.060]   With that, I'll turn the call over to our executive vice president, chief financial officer and
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:56.020]   treasurer, Brian Deenbrosia, who will provide additional detail on our third quarter financial
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.420]   performance and fiscal 2020 outlook.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.780]   Thank you, Brett and good morning, everyone.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:07.420]   Turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter, sales increased 6.2% year over
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:16.620]   year to $329.3 million, driven by sales from new stores of $22.7 million, including $20.7
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:22.860]   million from recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.180]   of approximately $0.8 million.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:30.020]   Same store sales in the quarter were down 0.9% year over year.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:37.580]   The third quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days, in line with the previous year period.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:45.660]   Growth margin decreased 20 basis points to 37.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 from 38%
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.620]   in the prior year period.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.580]   This decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:58.900]   of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:04.220]   However, as Brett mentioned, we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.060]   costs as a percentage of sales.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:15.540]   Operating expenses for the quarter increased $5.5 million to $92.8 million or 28.2% of sales
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:22.660]   as compared with $87.3 million or 28.1% of sales for the prior year period.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:28.860]   The year over year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net new stores.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:36.340]   Our operating income for the third quarter was $31.6 million, which increased by 2.8% as
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:42.500]   compared to operating income of $30.7 million for the same quarter last year and decreased
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.940]   as a percentage of sales from 9.9% to 9.6%.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:54.500]   Net interest expense for the third quarter increased $0.2 million to $7 million as compared to
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.900]   $6.8 million in the same period last year.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:03.140]   The weighted average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:08.220]   approximately $112 million as compared to the prior year period.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:13.580]   The increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease debt recorded in connection
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:18.860]   with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions and green field expansion, as well as an increase in
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:24.420]   debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisition.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.220]   The weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:34.200]   140 basis points year over year due to lower LIBOR and prime interest rates as well as lower
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.940]   borrowing rates associated with new leases.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:44.420]   Our effective tax rate was 24.1% for the third quarter compared to 15.3% for the same period
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.420]   last year.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:51.940]   The year over year increase is primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit adjustment
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:57.820]   we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change, which was related
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:03.860]   to certain deductions that the IRS accepted during the examination of our fiscal 2016
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.300]   and fiscal 2017 tax return.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:13.740]   That income for the third quarter was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the prior
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.300]   year period.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:21.380]   Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 56 cents compared to diluted
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:27.340]   earnings per share of 61 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.500]   Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is a non-gap measure, for the third quarter
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:37.740]   of fiscal 2020 was 60 cents, which excludes from diluted earnings per share three cents
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.660]   of costs related to Monroe Forward Initiative and one cent of cost related to acquisition
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.940]   due diligence and integration.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.660]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 57 cents in the third quarter
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.820]   of fiscal 2019, which excluded one cent of cost related to Monroe Forward Initiative, one
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:01.620]   cent of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs, and six cents benefit from
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.220]   the one-time income tax adjustment.
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.500]   For more information on this non-gap measure, please see the reconciliation of adjusted
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.940]   diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.900]   Lastly, we opened one Greenfield location during the third quarter.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.780]   As a reminder, Greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition of
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.140]   one-to-four store operations.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.500]   Greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately $1 million each in annual
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.500]   sales.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:39.740]   As of December 28, 2019, the company had 1,289 company operated stores and 99 franchise
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:47.300]   locations, as compared with 1,186 company operated stores and 99 franchise locations
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.460]   as of December 29, 2018.
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:57.100]   During the third quarter, we added 27 company operated stores and closed none.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:02.380]   Turning to Slide 9, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.940]   as we execute our growth strategy.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:11.140]   Our capital expenditures were $42.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, all
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:17.420]   of which approximately $18 million was related to investments in our Monroe Forward Initiative.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.820]   We are pleased with the progress of our Monroe Forward Strategy and we continue to expect
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:28.860]   an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years to
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.540]   support investments in story image and technology.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:38.700]   Additionally, accretive acquisitions support our growth strategy.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:45.300]   During the first nine months of the year, we spent approximately $104 million on acquisitions,
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.860]   including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our green field expansion strategy.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:56.660]   As Brett mentioned, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.420]   an expected $120 million in annualized sales.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.680]   I'd like to provide some additional clarity here.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.980]   The $120 million in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:15.220]   fully integrated, which as we've stated in the past is usually in year three post-acquisition.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:20.540]   During years one and two following the acquisition, we typically see a step down in sales given
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.340]   the process of onboarding new stores to our model.
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.460]   Moving on, we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.660]   our dividend program and paid approximately $22 million in dividends in the first nine
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.660]   months of fiscal 2020.
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:40.580]   Finally, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.180]   to support our strategic growth initiatives.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.940]   We entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.180]   covenant.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.580]   We generated approximately $125 million of cash flow from operating activities during the
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:23:00.380]   first nine months of fiscal 2020 and debt under our revolving credit facility increased by
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.140]   approximately $59 million.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:10.480]   Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide 10, we have updated our fiscal 2020
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.780]   comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of 1 percent to flat to reflect the
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.620]   impact of our year-to-day performance.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.660]   Based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:29.140]   closed acquisition, we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1 billion
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:37.780]   $275 million to $1 billion $290 million, an increase of 6.2 percent to 7.5 percent as
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.960]   compared to fiscal 2019 sales.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:49.500]   This compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1,295 million to $1,315 million.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:54.180]   Our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.580]   2020.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:02.260]   Given the impact of our year-to-day performance, we expect fiscal 2020 earnings for diluted share
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:11.180]   to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 representing a decline of 5.1 percent to 0.8 percent year
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:17.140]   over year compared to $2.37 in fiscal 2019.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:22.220]   This compares to the previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.55.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:28.740]   On an adjusted basis, which is a non-gap measure, the company expects diluted earnings for share
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:38.460]   to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 representing a decline of 1.7 percent to growth of 2.5 percent
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.540]   which excludes from diluted earnings for share Monroe Ford initiative cost and acquisition
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.220]   due diligence and integration cost.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:53.260]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings for share of $2.39 in fiscal 2019 which excluded
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:59.500]   Monroe Ford initiative cost, non-recurring corporate and field management realignment cost,
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.740]   acquisition due diligence and integration cost and the benefit from the one-time income
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.140]   tax adjustment.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:11.300]   Acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be diluted to earnings
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.900]   for diluted share during the year.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:19.580]   At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect an operating margin of approximately 10.2 percent
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:25.580]   interest expense to be approximately $29 million, depreciation and amortization to be approximately
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:31.420]   $65 million and EBITDA to be approximately $196 million.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.980]   We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million this year.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:41.060]   This guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5 percent and is based
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.980]   on 34 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:50.060]   As always, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or Greenfield store openings.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.940]   I'll now turn the call over to Brott to provide some closing remarks before we move to Q&A.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.820]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.180]   We are making solid strides in the execution of our Monroe Ford strategy, in particular
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.340]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.260]   The strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.820]   our confidence in this initiative.
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:14.940]   The store rebrand and reimage program is further supported by our technological investment
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.980]   which we believe will help drive long-term margin expansion.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.700]   In summary, we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business,
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.100]   making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.580]   within our control.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.460]   We are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.460]   ahead.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.300]   With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.300]   Thank you.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.260]   At this time we will be conducting a question and answer session.

[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.340]   Once again, that is star 1 to register questions at this time.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.220]   Our first question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.500]   Please go ahead.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.140]   Good morning, Brian.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:22.380]   I apologize for focusing on the weather here, but I just want to dive deeper into sales trends
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.380]   in the quarter.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.620]   You mentioned, I think Brian did too, on your prepared comments.
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:33.380]   You made some commentary suggesting that to the degree to which weather impacted the business.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.900]   I was wondering if you could drill down a little further and say what that negative 0.9 comp
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.020]   would have been had the weather cooperated.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:46.460]   Some of the other metrics you're seeing that really suggest the underlying business is
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:51.740]   trending better than what we saw in the weather affected fiscal queue 3.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:57.100]   I'll take the first part and I'll let Brian take the second part of the question, Brian.
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:02.940]   When we look at the performance in the quarter, as we talked about our northern markets certainly
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.300]   underperform the southern markets and give you a little more granularity on that, certainly
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:15.260]   our stores up in the Northeast and the Midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.980]   to weather conditions like you have in the Northeast certainly underperform.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.580]   I think it's difficult to say what we would have done.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.060]   Certainly I think we were expecting positive comps in the quarter.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:36.620]   Our internal expectations would have been closer to +1 to +1.5, assuming normalized
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.180]   weather conditions that we have seen in the past.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.980]   We felt really good coming out of October/November given the strength of last year's performance
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:52.060]   that we were popping against and didn't get the cooperation from the weather in December
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.140]   that we were certainly expecting.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:59.940]   As I made the comments in my fair remarks, we certainly don't like talking about the weather
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:06.860]   here, Brian, but we can't ignore the fact that when 50% of our business is tires and we have
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.700]   high concentration of stores in the Northeast and Midwest, we are going to have outsized
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.580]   exposure to our comp performance.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:20.700]   Brian, would you mind restating the second part of your question?
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:26.540]   Well, I think you covered, Brian, maybe I'll just follow up a question if I could.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:33.140]   So the adjusted guidance then, you mentioned so in January you did I think a -4.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:38.060]   Now if I'm doing the math, it looks as though the adjusted guidance would suggest some
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.140]   type of pickup then in business and in February and March.
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.940]   So I guess the first question is that assumption correct.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.860]   Then the following question is, I know we've seen this before with your business, but at
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:55.260]   what point does, because we still have a long, we have potentially a long time in the winter
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:00.260]   the weather could still come, but is there a point at which in the quarter where the weather
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.540]   just comes too late?
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:09.940]   Yeah, so Brian, your assumption is correct regarding the implied comps.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:17.220]   So if you think about Q4 at the midpoint of let's say down 0.5, for the full year down
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:24.860]   0.5, that implies Q4 of down 2 which would be about February and March being down 1 in order
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.100]   to get to that down 2.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.180]   So that's the dynamic at the midpoint.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.660]   So there is an expectation of a pickup in February and March.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:39.260]   And Brian maybe just to comment on the second part, you know as we get deeper into the fourth
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.140]   quarter or fourth quarter or the second half of the quarter in particular, I think we've
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:50.180]   become less sensitive to the weather as you transition out of say pure winter conditions
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:58.140]   into spring, certainly I think the later in the quarter you get snowfall certainly doesn't
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.820]   have the same impact on tire demand like you would find in our business if we got snowfall
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.540]   in October or November.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:11.580]   Consumers are pretty frifty with their money and I believe you get snowfall late in the
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:12.580]   season.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:18.420]   They have a tendency to forego that purchase and push it out till next season in particular.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:24.980]   The other thing to call out as well is if you look at our historic performance at the company,
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:30.620]   December and January have always been the most volatile month that we had to contend with.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:36.980]   And I think what we've seen in past performance here, trends coming out of December January
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:41.220]   don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring month.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:48.940]   So given the mild December/January heading into the balance of the quarter, we feel pretty
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.260]   good about the guidance range we provided.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:56.340]   As Brian said, our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our comp sales guidance, it
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.140]   assumes run rate coming out of January, which we certainly believe we're going to be better
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:05.340]   than that as we roll into FY 21.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.340]   I appreciate all the color.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.340]   Thank you.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.340]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:14.140]   Thank you, our next question is coming from Jonathan Lamers of BMO Capital Markets.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.380]   Please go ahead.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.380]   Thanks.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:26.060]   Brett, looking at your slide on the door rebranding, you know, the 18% performance of the rebranded
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.740]   stores I think is good.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.780]   I'm curious from your analytic model, how many years should it take a rebranded store to
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:40.300]   reach projected run rate sales?
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:48.180]   If you look at the top quadrant of that slide, Jonathan, we've shared, you know, with investors
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:53.860]   the fact that our service stores do roughly $600,000 in revenue and our tire stores do
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.860]   $1 million too.
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.260]   So in the case where we're rebranding a service store, you're working off the base on average
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:05.620]   of $600,000 and if we've seen, I'll call it double digit comp improvement off of that
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:12.220]   base, you can get to implied numbers certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:20.020]   to the full maturity, equally in the average sales performance of our tire rebranded stores.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.580]   That's one of the things that's encouraging about the strategy for us is not that it's
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:30.860]   just a one time step up in sales, this creates the opportunity to create multiple years of
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:39.140]   sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning, our brand related tires starts to mature.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:44.140]   Keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.820]   So if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires, we won't be
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:54.100]   relevant necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.900]   So to put that on a timeline, if you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:03.180]   out to average sales performance of the tire brand and store.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:09.540]   Okay, so just to circle up on that for the stores where you're rebranding, there's nothing
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:17.700]   about their market, like you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.460]   your existing tire brand stores at the 1.2 million, is that correct?
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.520]   Yeah, as a general statement, that's correct.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.900]   I think certainly you're going to have markets that will exceed the average and you'll have
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:35.540]   some markets that will be lower than that and that's part of the choices that we make using
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:41.900]   the analytic model but on average, as we look across our, I'll say the opportunity stores
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:48.260]   that being the 555, I think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.780]   of the 1.2 over time as they mature.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.180]   Thanks.
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:35:02.740]   Switching gears, Brian, how much of a headwind to that revenue from acquisitions were the
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.780]   conversions of the 42 California stores this quarter?
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:13.020]   Yeah, I mean, we had some disruption there.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:19.940]   I would say we haven't really quantified that from a sales standpoint but that's a great
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:25.040]   point, Jonathan, in that we have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:32.460]   Monroe Playbook and then shortly thereafter, in this case about six months, get the reimage
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.940]   in-store brand standards in place.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:44.460]   So in Q3, the 42 California stores went through that and are substantially through that as
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:50.020]   of the end of Q3 but we haven't quantified it but it certainly had some impact on their
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.660]   sales performance in the quarter.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:36:00.380]   Okay and that $1.8 million charge from Monroe Forward Initiative this quarter, what was that
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.380]   for?
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:09.540]   Yeah, it was all related to the store rebrand and reimage and it falls into three primary
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.820]   buckets related to that.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.860]   The first is non-capital items that we send to the stores.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:24.100]   So as we think about updated safety chains, updated Bay banners, updated point of sale
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:31.100]   marketing materials, all of these things to get the store initially to the standard that
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:37.360]   are not capital in terms of the actual work and construction done on the store.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.860]   That's the first bucket.
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.800]   The second bucket is non-capital work that's actually done.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:51.940]   We get into these stores and we identify non-capital repairs, demolition, as well as some of the
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:58.580]   fix versus replace items, for example, stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.580]   a new floor.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:04.580]   Those are things that make sense economically, but you get different treatment from expense
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.580]   versus capital for.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.780]   So that's the second bucket.
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:13.420]   And the third is just right off of existing leaseholds in the stores, anything from counters
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:19.060]   to maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition when we initially
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.020]   branded the stores over to a Monroe brand.
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:27.320]   Those are the three primary buckets that the Monroe Forward Initiative costs consist
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   of.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.140]   Okay, thanks for your comment.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.140]   Thank you.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:37.180]   Excuse me, our next question is coming from Brett Jordan of Jeffreeze.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.180]   Please go ahead.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.680]   Hey, good morning, guys.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.680]   Good morning.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   We're back.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:48.100]   Hey, back to slide five, I guess if we look at the 18% growth in rebranded stores, if we
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   really sort of look at the comparable growth there, X the new product lines you're adding,
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.420]   how's the service comp against the service comp in those stores?
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.500]   Are you seeing a pickup as you change the brand?
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:05.640]   Yeah, maybe just to clarify though, Brett, I think we're actually not adding any new products
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   to the service menu.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.660]   Right, but you're adding tires to the store, right?
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.220]   Yeah, it's just mixed, right?
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:17.400]   So even our service stores today sell tires, it's only 15% they're mixed.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:24.200]   So we're certainly seeing growth, more outsized growth in other tire sales and we've had success
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:29.900]   in maintaining the rate of growth that we've seen on the service side, which has been part
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:37.180]   of our thesis is hold on to the service business that we've enjoyed that's high margin and
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.860]   then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the tire
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.860]   category.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.880]   We're seeing growth on both sides.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.640]   Okay, and I guess we look at the reimage, how does that compare to comparable service
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.140]   stores in the network that hadn't been re-imaged?
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:59.820]   I guess sort of looking at it again, sort of apples to apples against the old stores.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:05.540]   Yeah, I think if you can figure out what stores we're talking about there, the 30 stores
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:12.420]   are Rochester and I think the Rochester stores certainly have been performing quite well relative
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.940]   to what our expectations were on re-image.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.580]   We certainly didn't expect to see double digit growth rates out of our re-image store when
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:25.300]   we set out to do this initiative, but we were seeing more positive growth out of the stores
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:30.740]   up until the last quarter, given the exposure that we've had to the weather in the north.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:35.740]   But compared to other stores, we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a customer service
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:41.820]   point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers facing similar
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.500]   I would say market backdrop from a weather point of view.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:50.500]   Okay, could you give us I guess sort of the spread between the southern store cop and the
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.100]   northern store cop, how big of a delta was it?
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:00.820]   I mean, it was a couple hundred basis points of performance.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:05.780]   Okay, and I guess for housekeeping, could you give us the monthly?
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:16.380]   Yeah, so we were, one second here, Brett, we were down 1.2 in October, down 1.7 in November
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.500]   and up 0.4 in December.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:24.300]   Okay, and then one, just this is, sorry to add the questions, on the supply chain side,
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.260]   I mean just to throw the virus into it, since that's popular these days, you guys do a lot
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:33.560]   of direct sourcing, you know, the white box product out of China, do you see any impact
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.980]   on supply chain from what's going on?
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:43.020]   We haven't seen any to this point, Brett, we're obviously working through contingency
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:50.540]   plans, which we have had to develop actually related to the tariff issues, so we feel pretty
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:56.620]   confident that through the network of the multiple supply points that we'll be able to overcome
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.780]   any particular issues coming from the virus.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:08.340]   I said no, it's joking, I said I had to get my first virus question then there.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:12.180]   Alright, thanks a lot guys.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.780]   Okay, thanks Brett.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.460]   Thank you, our next question is coming from Rick Nelson of Stevens, please go ahead.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.460]   Thanks, good morning.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:31.980]   Good morning, follow up on the weather last year, I think December, January, you also pointed
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:41.740]   to mild winter weather, do you think this year was incrementally worse than the prior year?
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:48.060]   I think if you look at, you know, analyst reports that we've seen talking about I guess
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:53.860]   the impact that the mild winter has had on not only our category but I think other retail,
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:42:00.740]   I think the data would indicate that this has been more mild, certainly versus last year,
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:06.060]   I think we look at precipitation, which is very important for us as a form of snow with
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:12.620]   our tire business, certainly it's been a much more mild winter this year relative to last
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.620]   year.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:23.500]   Thanks and Brett, any updates on your partnership with Amazon, what you're seeing there on the
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:35.380]   install side and how you think your tire prices compared to theirs and the tire category
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:44.140]   overall I'm curious about what happened with units in the period and market share?
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:53.540]   Yep, so let's start with units, our units were down to average selling price was up one
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:43:00.060]   for the quarter, how that compares, we don't have a lot of syndicated data, of course,
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:05.220]   we can look to and give you definitive on that, we lean on I guess our channel checks
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:10.740]   and information from our tire manufacturers that have good visibility across multiple brands
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:17.700]   and it feels like similar to other companies that have exposure to the north, particularly
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:23.740]   northeast, to the degree that we do feel like we are probably in line with what we picked
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.380]   up through suppliers and others.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:32.180]   As relates to Amazon, I think we're still pleased with our relationship with them as
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:40.980]   well as other online tire retailers, we will eventually expand the relationship and FY
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:48.020]   21 to include all stores, we talked about last quarter priority has been what I mentioned
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:53.980]   on today's call completing the entire category management pricing tool as well as the labor
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:59.900]   scheduling tool just for our organization on a higher priority at this stage than expanding
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.220]   it, but we are committed to expanding that relationship going forward.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:09.120]   Related to tire pricing, as you know Rick, the entire category is very complicated, you
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:15.460]   have over 30,000 SKUs that you need to manage effectively across multiple markets and one
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.300]   of the reasons why we've invested in the tire category management tool is to do a couple
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:27.640]   of things, one is give us much better visibility into demand dynamics defined by elasticity
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:34.460]   down to a SKU level and by having that visibility it's going to create a much more granular approach
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:42.000]   that we're going to use for pricing, allow us the price at the SKU level in our industry
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.580]   with the intent being strike that right balance between driving the right price to drive unit
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:55.020]   volume while preserving and expanding our entire margins through right mix at right price.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.220]   I'm encouraged we're in pilot form of that now.
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:04.620]   We will be operational by Q1 of next year, fully operational.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.700]   The rollout of that's pretty small in scale because we control our pricing centrally so
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.220]   a small team of people will be trained up on using that system.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:17.660]   But between now and Q1 we'll be testing in parallel and make certain we're confident with the
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.940]   results that we're seeing from the system.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:26.620]   That makes sense, thanks for the color and good luck.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.980]   Thanks Rick.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.980]   Thank you.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:33.260]   Once again, ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask a question please press star one
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.020]   on your telephone keypad.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.420]   Our next question is coming from Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.420]   Please go ahead.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:40.420]   Hi, good morning.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.420]   Thank you for the question.
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   Morning.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:49.500]   I wanted to go back, I know in the prior quarter when you started rolling out some of these
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:55.100]   store refreshes, you called out a hit or head one to comp during that quarter, really just
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.100]   from distraction.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:00.660]   You know, it makes sense as you're in there kind of reworking and revamping the stores.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.780]   I believe you said it was about a 70 basis point hit last quarter.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:08.700]   Did you quantify that this quarter or is there a way for you to kind of break that out or
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.460]   just whether overshadow that?
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:18.060]   Yeah, I think we said last quarter Stephanie that we, we walked everyone kind of through
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:25.340]   the seven step process and talked about how we were retooling it to take a lot of that
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.020]   work or almost all that work off of the store team.
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:31.820]   So we were able to effectively do that in Q3.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.980]   We didn't expect that we were going to have to talk about a head wind and we really don't
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:40.660]   have to in terms of from disruption related to the store reimage.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:46.700]   I think the California stores on the West Coast maybe saw a little bit more in disruption
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:53.260]   just because we did put a little bit more on them based on their lack of proximity to
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:58.980]   our core resources that are doing the reimage, but for the 74 comp stores those were largely
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:46:59.980]   I would say undisrupted.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:06.500]   Great and then just as a follow up when we look at the entire category in general what
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.580]   are you staying from this over in an inflationary environment?
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:15.020]   I know it was inflationary earlier this year kind of reviewing how you thought during the
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.900]   quarter and your expectations going forward as well.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:25.820]   Yes Stephanie, when you look at go back to Q2, one of the things we commented on was we
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:32.940]   saw some inflationary pricing on the top end of the product category with more premium
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:40.620]   brands and the first part of the second quarter we didn't see a lot of movement on the low
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:43.340]   end brands if you will, opening price point brands.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:48.780]   We saw that change exiting Q2 and into Q3 and I think as you saw and we made the comments
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:56.860]   in our prepared remarks we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across all price
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:04.420]   points relative to that point in Q3 I think our expectation for Q4 is pretty stable environment
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.060]   around pricing.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:14.620]   We don't expect meaningful material changes in the next quarter, we're very focused now
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:21.660]   on now optimizing our internal pricing relative to the market leveraging the category management
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.900]   pricing for the week we talked about.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.540]   Great and then just lastly for me, a more high level as we think through the strategy to
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:37.460]   expand just your tire services at some of the mixed changes at your service stores, does
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:43.260]   that just by nature put you a little bit more susceptible to changes in weather on an annual
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:49.180]   basis, to your point you said on the call that it is the tire category that if it's a more
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:55.320]   mild weather or where you don't really see the volume during that period so does this mean
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:00.380]   that in these conversations going forward weather could have a larger impact or similar
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:04.040]   to what we saw this year than maybe in prior years so maybe your thoughts on that at this
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.380]   high level would be great.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.380]   Thanks so much.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:14.020]   Yeah thanks Stephanie, I think strategically I would start with this, they are strategy
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:19.860]   and we like the business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that's focused
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:25.620]   on tires and full service, I think you're not going to see us migrate to a tire only
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.860]   category as a broad sweeping strategy for all the reasons you just mentioned, we like the
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:34.980]   diversification and the services, we like being very relevant on frequently purchased
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:41.980]   items like schedule maintenance for cars and certainly brakes and other undercar services.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:48.340]   I think as we increase our total business certainly we're going to pick up a little more exposure
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:55.300]   to tires as we convert more stores in the north I think to that, however I think our broader
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:01.580]   company strategy is diversifier shortboard print, more into the south and out west and
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:06.580]   certainly in those regions of the country you don't see I think the level of volatility
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:13.580]   that comes with the tire business like you would find in the northeast and midwestern markets.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:24.020]   Great, that's everything for me, I appreciate it.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:31.180]   Thank you our next question is coming from Scott Stember of CL King, please go ahead.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.060]   Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.060]   Where's Scott?
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:41.740]   Following up on that last question about you know high level about weather and I know the
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:45.980]   goal here was with all this heavy lifting that you're doing right now on all these new processes
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:52.340]   to get to the point where I guess we're not talking about weather having worked, weather
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:57.140]   does not really overlap a quarter from a common perspective, could you talk about, I mean just
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:01.980]   broadly speaking about how long do you think that will take for us to get to that point
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:06.700]   where weather could be a headwind but it's not going to be a determinant whether you're
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:10.820]   positive or negative from a common standpoint?
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:17.580]   I think given our exposure to the northeast as long as our store concentration is heavy
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:23.260]   in the Midwest and northeast and herring in that as we pick up exposure I think to weather.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:28.540]   Obviously we don't like to talk about sky as you said, our strategy is to diversify the
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:33.820]   footprint, keep continuing to grow down south and that's reflected by our acquisitions
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:40.540]   we continue to build out Florida and have expanded now into Louisiana and Tennessee and certainly
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:46.620]   out west is reflected of that desire to crave more or less volatility in our business due
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:49.660]   to this store footprint.
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:57.340]   Now in our core store markets we don't accept internally the volatility in our business and
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:04.340]   we're invested in technology as we talked about to help us better execute in stores through
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:10.660]   better trained people, executing better on the phones with our phone upgrade that we're currently
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.660]   doing.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.940]   All the initiatives under Monroe Forward are designed to drive performance in our stores
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:21.620]   regardless of weather so I think we'll help neutralize some of the impact that we see from
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:25.800]   the volatility that comes with snow and colder temperatures.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:33.220]   Got it and just a last question, you know I know that there are certain things like
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:39.700]   tires that we'll see an immediate impact from weather but more on the side of mechanical
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:47.180]   parts typically you could see an impact from you know warmer weather or colder weather
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:52.780]   you know a few quarters down the road is there a chance that we could see an extended negative
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.220]   impact on the mechanical part side in the next couple of quarters and that's all I have
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.220]   thanks.
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.180]   Thanks Scott.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:05.380]   I think as we commented in the quarter our breaks were down 3% in the quarter certainly
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:10.580]   we're up against a strong comp from last year but also I would say we do sell a fair share
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:15.420]   of brake services through tires because if you take the consumers' tires off their vehicle
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:21.900]   gives you the chance to inspect their wheels, their brakes and we do see some nice demand
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.500]   for conversion from tires into brakes as a result of that.
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:33.420]   As it relates to the downstream effect I think certainly more harsh winners tend to see to
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:39.720]   tear up things on the vehicles, however I will say one benefit of having a more mild winner
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:46.300]   is usually that leads to spring coming sooner, it opens up a window I think for an extended
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:53.700]   spring selling season so we felt feel like we're well positioned I think coming out of the
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:58.660]   winter given our strengths and how we perform historically in the service categories and
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:04.460]   given the emphasis we placed on good, better, best packages in store I think we feel confident
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:09.260]   that we'll be well positioned going into the spring selling season.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:12.940]   Got it, that's all I have thanks.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.940]   Thanks Scott.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:14.940]   Thank you.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:21.340]   At this time I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.100]   Thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest and support of Monroe.
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:28.860]   We believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy and drive long-term value for
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:29.940]   our shareholders.
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:36.660]   We look forward updating you on our progress next quarter, have a great day.
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:40.140]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation, this concludes today's event.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:43.380]   You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Good morning and welcome to the first quarter of 2020 General Electric Company Earnings
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200]   Conference Call.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.220]   My name is Brandon and I'll be your operator for today.
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.400]   At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.120]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session during which you can dial star one
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.780]   if you have a question.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.320]   Please note this conference is being recorded and I will now turn it over to Steve Winiker,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.760]   Vice President of Investor Communications, you may begin, sir.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   Thanks Brandon.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.680]   Good morning and welcome to GE's first quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.400]   I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO Larry Kulp and CFO Carolina Dadekapa.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.880]   Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880]   on our website.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.080]   Note that some of the statements we're making are forward looking and our base and our best
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.000]   view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.300]   As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change if the world
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.300]   changes.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.640]   With that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.240]   Steve, thanks, good morning everyone.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.120]   We hope you and your families are healthy and safe.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.680]   Our thoughts are with all of those affected by this global pandemic.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.560]   We recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.360]   On behalf of GE, I want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.640]   community, many of whom were privileged to call our customers, working tirelessly to protect
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.400]   all of us.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.400]   Thank you.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.000]   When we last spoke during our Outlook call in March, we were encouraged by the continued
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.720]   strength and aviation and healthcare and the progress made in power and renewables.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.720]   In the eight-week sense, the world has fundamentally changed.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.520]   As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly, hitting hard and hitting fast.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.600]   While this is an earnings call, our goal today is to provide you with the most current and
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.280]   relevant information we have and as always, to be as open and transparent as we possibly
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   can.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.800]   So forgive us if we run a little long today.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.840]   The COVID-19 dynamics at GE, like the economy at large, are fluid and still evolving, but
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.760]   clearly challenging in the near term.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.240]   With that, I'll start with our response to COVID-19.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.560]   Carolina, who is joining our earnings call for the first time will cover the financials
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.440]   then I'll wrap with a more in-depth view of our current operations.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.840]   Moving to slide two, during this unprecedented time, we're focused on three areas.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.360]   First, the health and safety of our employees and our communities.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.800]   We established a COVID-19 task force that is working to ensure we're doing everything
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.120]   in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with various government directives
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.400]   and medical advisories in real time.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.680]   To that end, we've encouraged those employees who are not directly performing customer-facing
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.800]   essential jobs to work from home wherever possible.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.480]   But given the mission critical work we do at GE, not everyone can stay home.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.720]   I'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.320]   unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers, supporting essential services
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.880]   like hospitals, power generation, airlines and national defense.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.640]   We're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.160]   This includes temperature screenings, face coverings and gloves as necessary and physical distancing
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.960]   all keeping with national, state and local guidelines.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.760]   I'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.720]   We recently established an employee relief fund and more than 75 senior leaders across
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.960]   GE have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.320]   Our second priority is continuing to serve our customers.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.080]   In healthcare we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.720]   and treat COVID-19 patients including respiratory CT monitoring solutions X-ray anesthesia and
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.840]   point of care ultrasound product lines.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.000]   Already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.360]   end of June.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.200]   Healthcare's digital and AI solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.960]   at once and automate wrote tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.840]   on life saving work.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.920]   Across all of our businesses we're in constant communication with employees, customers, suppliers
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.560]   and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.600]   Our third priority is preserving our strength.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.520]   First and foremost sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.440]   a key focus.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.040]   With the recent closing of the biopharma transaction we received $20 billion of net
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.200]   proceeds.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.000]   This provides GE with optionality to protect our company and remain flexible and importantly
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.040]   we retain the $17 billion leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem striving for
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.160]   precision health.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.440]   Preserving our strength at a time like this also requires a different operating model.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.120]   Here I draw on my experience as a CEO managing through 9/11 and the global financial crisis.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.880]   There are three steps in this model.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.000]   Embrace reality, redefine winning and execute the plan.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.240]   Easy to say, hard to do.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.120]   Starting with embrace reality, this is necessary in a time like this when so much is changed
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.760]   and remains uncertain.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.520]   For us it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.640]   be for a while.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.080]   We wish it were otherwise, but that's not our reality.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   Next, redefine winning.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.760]   We came into 2020 with a plan that defined winning as profitable growth, margin expansion
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.720]   and cash generation.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.360]   Now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.320]   Let me share some ways we're doing this.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.360]   While safety has always been a top priority for GE, COVID-19 has reshaped our safety agenda.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.820]   In terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and decriminal margins
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.960]   in the second half, our key focus areas and in health care, we clearly didn't come into
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.040]   the year expecting to increase our ventilator production fourfold, but we will.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.120]   And finally, execute the plan.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.880]   We're moving with speed, discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure targeting more
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.360]   than $2 billion of cost actions and more than $3 billion of cash actions.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.480]   And this is where lean is particularly relevant from daily management through traditional
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.080]   Kanban systems which help reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools we're rolling
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.580]   out across GE.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.880]   Let me share a recent example from gas power.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.040]   In our Greenville facility, the team used lean to cut the distance that a single part travels
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:16.280]   during production from three miles, yes, three miles, to a mere 165 feet, flashing the time
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.880]   it took to make that part by 42%.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.560]   These are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this environment.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.160]   So that's our approach here.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.440]   We're facing the pandemic head on while continuing to execute our long term strategy for GE.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.760]   Moving to slide three, you'll find a snapshot of our first quarter results and Carolina
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.640]   will take you through this in detail, but first a few top line thoughts.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.560]   As I noted, we entered the year with momentum, however, as COVID-19 continued to spread globally
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.960]   and I'm not going to sugarcoat this, we got hit hard and some of our highest margin parts
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.440]   of our best performing businesses.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.620]   This is especially true at aviation services where COVID-19 caused a rapid decline in commercial
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:09.200]   aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the second half of March.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.140]   A similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions caused
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.120]   by COVID-19 impacted our field personnel.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.440]   And across all of our businesses, we started to see some project fulfillment and execution
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   issues.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.480]   At the same time, healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.560]   in the fight against COVID-19.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.600]   Taking a step back about 80% of our roughly $400 billion backlog is in services which have
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.000]   a long time horizon and while services have been hurt in the near term, those capabilities
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.880]   remain one of our greatest strengths, they keep us close to our customers with deep strategic
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.280]   relationships especially through periods of volatility.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.160]   So in the spirit of embracing reality, let me frame for you what we're seeing right now
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.960]   at a high level and then I'll do a deeper dive after Carolina reviews the first quarter.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.520]   In aviation and at GCast, airlines are conserving cash, not flying the planes they have, limiting
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.520]   maintenance spend where they can and all the while deferring orders in many places.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.840]   No one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume but the reality
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.560]   is likely it's not soon.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.400]   So we're redefining winning from margin expansion in 2020 to improving our decriminal margins
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.600]   this year which requires we aggressively adjust our cost structure.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.960]   That's what winning looks like for aviation and they're moving forward with a comprehensive
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   plan.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:44.200]   To be clear, we'll get back to targeting those 20% operating margins post pandemic.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.820]   In healthcare, we've been on the front lines from batting COVID-19 since the early days
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.840]   in Wuhan.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.700]   This is fundamental to our mission.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.800]   While we've seen demand surge for certain products, other products including those in
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.960]   our high margin pharmaceutical diagnostics business have been negatively impacted as multiple procedures
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.040]   are deferred.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.640]   Care is likely to rebound faster than aviation but we're still fast-tracking additional cost
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:21.540]   out actions targeting an incremental $700 million since Karen and the team spoke with you in December.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.040]   In power and renewable energy, the impact of COVID-19 has been more limited to date.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.820]   Specifically at power, we're experiencing outage delays and restrictions in field service
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.520]   travel and we're monitoring new unit orders and services.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.260]   To offset this, we're further right sizing the cost structure and in power, we already
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.240]   reduced headcount by 700 in the first quarter.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.680]   Now clearly across GE there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:57.280]   including the full duration, magnitude and pace of recovery across our end markets, operations
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.520]   and supply chains.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:03.840]   We're also monitoring how the resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.720]   and our runoff insurance business.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.920]   So let me tell you what we do know, the second quarter will be the first full quarter with
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.480]   pressure from COVID-19 and we expect that our financial results will decline sequentially
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.760]   before they improve later this year.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.040]   The bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead but this too shall pass.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.360]   I'm confident the underlying reset we took over the last 18 months to focus GE's portfolio
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   and instill a greater focus on customers and lead give us a running start for what we face
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.640]   today.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:45.880]   Moreover, I've seen our response to COVID-19 signs of how we're moving faster to change
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.600]   GE for the good, more to rework to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.160]   in aviation, travel restrictions spurring on the use of remote digital technology to complete
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.400]   field work and renewables and more capital discipline across the board.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.600]   With new leaders assimilating faster and with real impact, health care comes to mind.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.960]   So all of this in combination with the planned actions we'll discuss later are accelerating
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.720]   our transformation of GE.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.080]   With that I'll turn it over to Carolina but before I do let me say how pleased I am to
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.520]   have her on board.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:26.160]   In two short months it's clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:33.320]   operational bias for action and executing with speed.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   Thank you Larry.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.400]   I am proud to join my first earnings call at CFO of GE and help lead this company forward.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:47.520]   As you noted we're operating in unprecedented times and we are focused on first keeping
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.720]   our financial position strong and safe with a keen eye on leverage and liquidity as well
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.880]   as cash flow and capital discipline.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   While GE's actions over the last couple of years have put us on stronger footing ahead
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.400]   of this situation we will do more.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.760]   Second working with our businesses to take the right action not only to help mitigate
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.180]   the impact of COVID-19 but to serve customers better operate smarter and more efficiently
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.560]   and integrate lead more holistically.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.480]   While Larry and I are focused on the near term we're also managing for the long term.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.560]   We're working together to reduce complexity at GE to build a leading culture that delivers
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.760]   sustainable earnings and cash flow generation.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.440]   Today my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.000]   help you see what I see across the businesses.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.320]   With that let's turn to slide four.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.520]   This was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated taking
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.280]   it from the top.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.560]   First quarter orders were down 3% organically or down 4x biopharma.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.200]   Growth in power and health care was upset by double digit declines in aviation and renewables.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   Both equipment and service orders were down low single digits.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.720]   I'll cover this by business shortly.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.280]   Industrial revenue was down 5% organically or down 6x biopharma with equipment revenue
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.720]   flat and services down 9%.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:21.000]   Business aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID-19.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.240]   Adjusted industrial profit margins were down 450 basis points organically.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.400]   Most of the dilution came from aviation and renewables with the aviation impact mostly
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.800]   driven by COVID-19.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:39.960]   Now let's discuss the EPS work starting at continuing EPS of 72 cents.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:47.120]   There was a 75 cent gain primarily related to the 11.5 billion of tax gain from the biopharma
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.680]   sale which also included one cent of tax benefit in geocapital.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:58.880]   This was partially upset by a 4.6 billion after tax loss on our remaining Baker huge stake
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.280]   which we measure at fair value edge quarter.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.800]   On restructuring and other items we incurred two cents of charges.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.240]   This is principally related to the reduction of aviation's U.S. workforce.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:17.320]   Lastly non-operating pension and other benefit plans were 6 cents head within the quarter.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.720]   Excluding these items adjusted EPS was 5 cents.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.080]   As described earlier our earnings performance was materially impacted by COVID-19 and other
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.080]   market dynamics.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.540]   This was primarily in aviation and geocapital with negative marks and impairments in both
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.080]   precas and insurance as well as higher credit costs.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:43.760]   We estimate the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from COVID-19 roughly 700 million.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:49.560]   Drivers included lower aftermarket sales, project delays and supply chain constraints.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:55.520]   This impact is higher than anticipated at the March outlook call reflecting the rapid global
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:02.440]   progression of the pandemic while our prior forecast largely affected the slowdown in China.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.240]   Our focus on addressing this pandemic is global we're targeting more than 2 billion of cost
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.240]   out this year.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   But this may not affect the full impact we're rapidly addressing both cost and cash and making
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.000]   our businesses more agile and customer focused over time.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.440]   I can tell you from my experience that as these programs build momentum and the company
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.600]   leaders begin to see how powerful results can be they tend to extend beyond their stated
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   goals.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   With just what I have seen so far I'm encouraged that we can have some of that same experience
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.600]   achieve.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:40.760]   Moving to cash, as many of you know the first quarter is typically low for our free cash
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.760]   flow.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:48.440]   This year we're impacted by our usual sustainability but also COVID-19 especially in aviation.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.920]   Industrial free cash flow was a use of 2.2 billion, 1 billion worse than prior year but
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:59.200]   notably excluding aviation each industrial business improved free cash flow versus lost
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   years.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:07.960]   Turning to the key drivers in the quarter starting with net earnings if you exclude the biopharm again
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:13.600]   and the market on our making huge investments income depreciation and amortization total
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.960]   700 million that's down 900 million versus prior year.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   Working capital negative 2.6 billion with a significant use of cash down 1.1 billion.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.240]   Let me take it through the main factors.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.600]   First we had the net inflow in accounts receivable driven by seasonally lower volume in gas power
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   and renewables.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:40.480]   Second we had an outflow in accounts cable driven by lower volume in aviation and higher
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.000]   disbursements related to prior year material buys in renewables.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.240]   Third we increased inventory to support unexpected second and third quarter volume ramp in onshore
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.880]   wind and shop output declined in aviation.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:00.280]   Fourth progress collections they were a use of cash as new orders and milestone payments
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:05.680]   were more than affect by burn down of prior progress payments in power and renewables.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:12.960]   Lastly we also spent about 600 million in gross capital we don't track now to reduce 25 percent
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.700]   of our cap expense this year.
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:21.480]   For cash flow in total we estimate the first quarter impact from covid 19 of around 1 billion
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.040]   the majority of which was felt in aviation.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.440]   As we look forward we expect continued free cash flow pressure we're targeting more than
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.840]   3 billion in cash action however over time we know that each business can be a better
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.520]   cash generating as we improve execution.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:46.120]   Going to slide six we continue to strengthen our balance sheet the largest milestone in
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:53.000]   the quarter was closing by a farmer the 20 billion of proceed we ended the quarter with 33.8 billion
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.720]   of industrial cash up approximately 16 billion sequentially the capital ended with 13.5 billion
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:07.120]   of cash down approximately 5.3 billion sequentially driven by contractual maturity we continue
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.920]   to hold a liquidity balance covering 12 months of G debt maturity.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:17.840]   We've recently taken actions to enhance and extend our liquidity and pay down debt.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:25.600]   On April 17 GE entered into a three year 15 billion syndicated revolving credit facility.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.760]   This was a planned refinancing of GE's prior 20 billion syndicated revolver credit facility
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.480]   including bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of 20 billion in total credit
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.440]   lines accept going forward.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.680]   Following the sale of biopharma we also improved our liquidity profile in April we reduced our
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:50.720]   near term debt maturity by issuing 6 billion in GE debt in April and subsequently tendering
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:56.200]   for 4.2 billion of debt we plan to use the remaining 1.8 billion of proceeds to further
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.400]   debt reduction and the combinational transaction will therefore be leveraged neutral.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:10.920]   GE industrial has no debt maturities in 2021 1.9 billion of maturities in 2022 and 900 million
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.560]   in 2023.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:19.240]   At GE industrial we reduced debt by approximately 7 billion we reduced commercial paper used
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.560]   by 1.1 billion in the quarter and we paid 6 billion of the intercompany loan from GE
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.480]   to GE capital in April using proceeds from biopharma.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:35.000]   At GE capital we reduced debt by 4 billion so we reduced external debt by 10 billion
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.600]   yesterday including 4.7 billion of maturities in the quarter and an additional 5.4 billion
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:48.400]   of 2020 maturities tendered in April offset by GE's 6 billion repayment from the intercompany
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   loan.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:58.040]   Our financial policy goals remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than 2.5
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:05.520]   times net debt to IBDA at GE industrial and less than 4 times debt to equity at GE capital.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:12.520]   Accredit rating in the single A range and reinstating a dividend in line with peers over time.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.660]   We remain committed to achieving our leverage targets but we now expect to achieve those
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:23.400]   targets over a longer period than previously and not due to the impact of COVID-19.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.520]   On slide 7 we'll discuss industrial segments results.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   Starting with aviation.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.160]   As you've noted our first quarter results were materially impacted.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.760]   Orders were down 13% organically with both equipment and service orders bound.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:45.040]   Equipment orders were down 27% primarily driven by commercial engines business due to the
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:52.440]   max grounding and the COVID impact services orders were down 4% primarily driven by commercial
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.680]   services partially upset by military which one new fighter and helicopter service orders
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.920]   from the US DOD.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.160]   Service orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders which were up 60%
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.360]   year over year.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:13.880]   Backlog of 273 billion was flat sequentially and up 22% versus prior year primarily driven
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.720]   by long-term service agreements.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:22.320]   This included roughly 201 billion order cancellations in the quarter.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.520]   Service revenue was down 11% organically.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.600]   Equipment revenue was down 17% we shipped 472 commercial install and spare engine units
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.440]   this quarter down 37 versus prior year.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:46.120]   Sales of 272 deep 1A and 1B units were down 152 and CFM 56 units were down 98 units.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.800]   Service revenue was down 8% due to commercial services down 11%.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:58.480]   This was driven by lower spare parts shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of COVID-19.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:05.760]   30 military revenue was down 7% with 146 engine units shipments down 9% and this was driven
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.440]   by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound material partly upset by the advanced programs
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.440]   growth.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:19.400]   Operating profit was down 39% organically primarily on lower volume and negative mix pressure
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:26.240]   in commercial services from the impact of COVID-19 and lower spare engine units.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.400]   Segment margin contracted 650 basis points organically.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:35.080]   This was primarily due to COVID-19 impacting our commercial businesses in both engines
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.060]   and services.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:44.280]   The continued 737 max grounding the non-repeat of prior year favorable contract adjustments
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.000]   and the first full quarter of revenue from our derivative business now that we have deconsolidated
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   big issues.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.200]   To add a bit more color COVID-19 represents just over half of the year-over-year margin
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   difference.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:03.560]   737 max timing considering install and spare engine volume and supply chain excess costs represent
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.140]   additional 20% of the ride.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.040]   Moving to healthcare which performed well.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.600]   Orders were up 9% organically.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.880]   Equipment orders were up 14% and services were up 1.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.240]   Healthcare orders excluding biopharma were up 6%, driven by a surge demand related to
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   COVID-19.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:28.680]   This was partially upset by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   to COVID-19.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:35.240]   Examples like MR and intervention in healthcare systems as well as contrast media and nuclear
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.000]   traces in pharmaceutical diagnostics.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.120]   Life Sciences orders were up 10%.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:50.240]   Backlog was 17.4 billion down 6% sequentially and down 3% prior year due to the sale of biopharma.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.480]   Excluding biopharma backlog was up 1% sequentially and 4% prior year.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.160]   Revenue was up 2% organically and 1% excluding biopharma.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.760]   Healthcare systems revenue was up 2% with services and 3% with equipment flat.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.680]   Life Sciences was up 4%.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.880]   Development profit was up 10% organically.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:19.240]   Segment margin expanded 140 basis points organically or 30 basis points excluding biopharma.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:24.040]   This was driven by volume and cost productivity of fed by price and logistics pressures from
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   COVID-19.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:34.220]   Next on power we had mixed results with equipment top line strengths of fed by challenges in services.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:40.220]   Powered orders were up 14% organically, gas power orders were up 8% with equipment orders
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.080]   up 37% largely due to one term key order.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:49.080]   We bought 2.2 gigawatt of orders for nine gas turbines.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.560]   Gas power service orders were down 3% with contractual services down and transaction upgrades
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.520]   roughly flat.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.140]   Powered portfolio orders were up 27% with strong equipment and services orders in spoon
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.640]   and power conversion.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.160]   Job closed at 85 billion flat sequentially and down 1% versus prior year.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.400]   Gas backlog was 71 billion flat sequentially.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.080]   Revenue was down 12% organically largely driven by services.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.920]   In gas power revenue was down 12%.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:27.320]   Gas power equipment revenue was up 4% organically on higher H turbine mix.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:33.680]   We shipped seven gas turbines versus nine gas turbines in the first quarter of 19.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.160]   We helped our customers achieve commercial operations on over 32 units translating almost
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.120]   4.7 gigawatt of new power added to the grid.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:50.840]   Gas power services revenue was down 19% organically as outage and transaction sales pushed out
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.520]   of the quarter due to COVID-19 and we had lower revenue on higher margin upgrades.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.920]   Like this services would still have been down in the quarter.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.080]   This was driven by supply-based constraints on hot gas part parts and outage cost overall
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.520]   pressuring our CSA margin rate.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.040]   Power portfolio revenue was down 12%.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.520]   This was driven by lower volumes across the sub segments.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.360]   In steel we had lower services back low convertibility.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.480]   In nuclear the decline was driven by outage timing and in power conversion we refined our
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:28.160]   sales parameter focused on higher margin market segment.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:36.280]   Operating profit was down 239 million and segment margin contracted 570 basis points organically.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:41.960]   While gas power fixed costs were down 9% sequentially and 16% versus prior year this was more than
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:48.800]   offset by lower service volume and additional costs from COVID-19 disruption.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:54.080]   Next on renewables continue revenue growth was more than offset by fulfillment and execution
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.680]   issues impacting profitability.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:04.120]   Orders were down 11% organically equipment were down 11 as we cycle a stronger US PTC
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.040]   and services were down 23%.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.680]   A positive spot in the quarter was international orders which were up 11%.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:20.760]   That log of 26.5 billion was down 4% sequentially but up 5% versus prior year.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:28.120]   Revenue was up 28% organically this was mainly driven by onshore wind up 60%.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:34.720]   Onshore equipment revenue was up 81% with the new unit turbine delivers of 731 more than double
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:41.000]   prior year and repower kit delivers of 219 up 40%.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.120]   More services revenue excluding repower kits was up 15%.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:52.360]   Onshore order pricing index continues to stabilize at 1% in line with recent trends.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:59.640]   Grid revenue was down 8% mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones driven by COVID-19.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.840]   Operating loss was down 115 million.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:07.840]   This was driven by the supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 fulfillment delays and the
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.920]   non-recurrence of the non-cash gain from an offshore wind contract termination in the prior
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   year.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.460]   This was partially upset by higher onshore wind volume.
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:24.080]   Segment margin contracted 210 basis points mainly driven by the same items mentioned above
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:30.680]   and the range of execution issues were fixing at grid and hydro.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.840]   Moving to slide 8 starting with GA capital.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   In the quarter adjusted continue operations generated a net loss of 118 million.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.660]   This excludes the impact of the capital loss tax benefit utilized against biopharm again
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:53.080]   resulting in 88 million of earnings compared to prior year which excludes the U.S. tax reform
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.520]   benefit continuing net earnings was unfavorable by 154 million.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:03.760]   This was due to negative marks and impairments at GCAP and insurance lower gains and lower
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.160]   earnings from a smaller asset base.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.680]   This was partially upset by lower excess interest cost and SGNA.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.760]   We ended the quarter with 101 billion of assets excluding liquidity.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.800]   This was down 1 billion sequentially primarily driven by GCAP due to asset sales depreciation
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.760]   and collections partially upset by new volume.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.840]   Insurance assets were flat sequentially at the decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:36.680]   by higher market rates was upset by the annual insurance capital contribution.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.060]   Supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continued to migrate to MUFG.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:48.200]   As noted earlier capital ended the quarter with 13.5 billion of liquidity.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:54.520]   Capital also ended with 54.5 billion of debt which was down 4.5 billion sequentially driven
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.400]   by debt maturity.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.800]   With continued operations generated a net loss of 164 million which was unfavorable versus
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.840]   prior year by 200 million.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:11.320]   We still plan to provide the required support to GE Capital in line with insurance tax dollar
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   funding.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:18.160]   Next just like our businesses corporate needs to adjust our new reality and we are continuing
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:24.520]   to take additional structural actions to rationalize costs and reduce the size at corporate.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:31.260]   Moving at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were 374 million 8% higher but that's primarily
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.740]   due to higher intercompany profit elimination which will partially offset by better digital
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.960]   performance from continued cost reduction actions.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:46.080]   Functions and operations were 25% lower primarily driven by GE Digital's improvement.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.280]   You can see from digital performance that the focus cost reduction programs are getting
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.780]   correction.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.960]   We continue to right size our functional costs across GE and push more accountability into
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   the division.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:03.920]   Larry and I are conducting cost and cash reviews of each of the businesses with fresh eyes in
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.880]   the current environment so you can expect that there will be more to come.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.680]   Stay tuned.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:15.800]   I have spent most of my career in leadership at lean decentralized companies.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.520]   Fundamentally I believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers businesses
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.480]   to take the right action quickly.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:29.880]   This type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with COVID-19
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.000]   but also to be prepared to pivot to growth.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.640]   We are working toward this goal and there will be more to come.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.440]   With that back to you Larry.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:51.520]   There is no question that COVID-19 is putting real pressure on our businesses.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.820]   Given that so much has changed and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:01.280]   from COVID-19, I would like to spend some time here discussing second quarter trending
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.320]   based on what we are seeing through the month of April.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:11.360]   Starting with aviation on slide nine, of all of our industrial segments, this business is
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.640]   feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.480]   The rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.720]   airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:29.040]   We will cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail but on the
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.960]   other end of the spectrum demand for our military business remains strong.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.760]   To that end we rebalanced some of our capacity to meet this increased demand.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:44.500]   To offset some pressure in the commercial business we are taking several steps that while painful
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:49.080]   preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:56.120]   We have previously announced $500 to $1 billion in cash actions and we have now increased this
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:02.880]   targeting more than $1 billion in cost actions and more than $2 billion in cash actions.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:08.000]   This will be achieved through different initiatives, some of which have been completed, others in
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.280]   flight as we speak.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:15.060]   These include a 10% reduction in aviation's total U.S. workforce and furloughs impacting
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:22.600]   50% of its U.S. maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufacturing will
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.920]   continue to monitor and potentially extend as required.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:34.200]   We re also focused on reducing the discretionary and cap expense and optimizing working capital.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:39.800]   I know aviation's decriminal margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.640]   and Carolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.120]   While we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the second
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:53.440]   quarter our expectations are that the cost action we re undertaking will improve decriminal
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.680]   margins in the back half of the year.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.480]   While there are many uncertainties, I expect that we will exit the year with a much lower
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.240]   decriminal margin than what you saw in the first quarter.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.800]   So make no mistake, thriving improvement here is our number one focus.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.660]   As we think about the full year, we re tracking travel restrictions, carrier and passenger
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:19.000]   behavior, disease countermeasures and freight demand, all of which will impact aircraft
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.720]   departures and revenue passenger kilometers.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   While we re seeing an unprecedented decline in 2020, we re taking action and David and
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:34.720]   the team are working proactively with our customers to navigate through this crisis.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.880]   So spending a little more time on commercial services which represented $3.3 billion of
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.640]   revenue in the first quarter, let s go to slide 10.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.360]   As you can see on the left side, departures across the full industry were strong in the
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.160]   first quarter before rapidly declining in mid-March.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.900]   As we look at it this week, focused on the GE and CFM fleet, global departures are down
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.200]   approximately 75 percent.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.800]   Roughly 60 percent of the CFM fleet is parked today.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.080]   In line with this, we re also seeing significant headwinds and global shop visits which were
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.880]   down low double digits in the first quarter as airlines defer short-term maintenance
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.900]   and we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better with some potential to moderate
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.700]   in the latter half of the year depending on the variables just outlined.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.180]   Based on what we re seeing through the month of April in the second quarter, we re seeing
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:32.760]   shop visits down roughly 60 percent and CSA billings down roughly 50 percent.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.300]   Additionally we expect the significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.120]   our CSA margins.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:45.680]   That said, when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time, GE is well
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:51.360]   positioned with the largest and youngest install base of all engine manufacturers.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:59.240]   Additionally, roughly 62 percent of our GE CFM fleet has seen one shop visit for the last
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.240]   and this will generate demand upon recovery.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   We have more narrow bodies that are 10 years or younger than the narrow body install base
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.420]   of the rest of the industry and when we see a pickup and air travel demand, we expect narrow
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:17.680]   bodies will recover most quickly.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.220]   Overall it was a challenging quarter and we are expecting additional pressure here in the
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:28.880]   second but our cost action will alleviate some of the pressure in the second half of 2020.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   Moving to commercial engines which represented $1.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.060]   in light of COVID-19, air framers are producing at a lower rate.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.140]   Based on what we re seeing through the month of April, in the second quarter we see installed
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:49.440]   engines down roughly 45 percent and spare engines down roughly 60 percent year on year, attributable
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.120]   to the delivery deferrals, in addition to the already planned lower production rate on
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.460]   the 737 MAX.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:02.880]   In the near term we are rightsizing production capacity and actively managing the supply base.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   We have very strong relationships with the air framers and an attractive value proposition
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.640]   is evidenced by a multi-year backlog.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:14.080]   As you will see on the right, we have strong positions, sole source on two of the biggest
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:19.240]   new engine entrants and a 65 percent win rate on the other.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.360]   While we acknowledge there is pressure on near term demand for new aircraft, these stats
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:29.080]   demonstrate to customers see the value of GE technology.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:35.040]   We are taking the right actions to be well positioned for the post pandemic world.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.880]   Community healthcare consists of healthcare systems and PDX.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.200]   In the second quarter to date we are seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.320]   into diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 within healthcare systems.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.520]   These product orders including ventilators have increased one and a half to two times
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:59.120]   versus pre-pandemic levels, but at the same time we are seeing reduced demand for other
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.680]   diagnostic products as certain procedures are deferred or canceled around the world.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:09.100]   To be clear, these other diagnostics are still essential and often associated with saving
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:15.400]   lives, in areas including oncology and cardiology, but are currently deprioritized.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.800]   PDX is a similar story.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:23.200]   This is a high margin this is made about contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.320]   procedures that are being deferred or canceled right now.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.760]   Several HCS product lines and most of PDX is down as much as 50 percent versus pre-pandemic
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.120]   levels.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.380]   While these dynamics vary by country, there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.120]   experience different stages of the virus.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:48.080]   Taking China for example, as hospitals come back online, we are seeing a ramp in previously
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:53.720]   deferred procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.280]   Healthcare is accelerating its planned transformation to expand margins post biopharma by reducing
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:06.440]   head count, fixed costs, discretionary spend and marketing spend, prioritizing R&D, deferring
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.000]   CAPX and optimizing working capital.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.900]   Looking forward, we are most focused on the following indicators for healthcare, hospital
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:20.680]   admission and occupancy rates and increase in non-COVID-19 procedures, changes in hospital
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:27.000]   CAPX budgets, government spending on healthcare broadly and development of COVID-19 test treatments
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.800]   and vaccines.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.280]   Based on our experience in China and the market in April, we expect to be down in the second
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.960]   quarter with potential recovery afterwards.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:44.040]   COVID-19 has highlighted the need to build and truly invest and scale a new digitized
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.800]   infrastructure and quickly.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.440]   We're committed to our investment in our digital Edison platform and solutions like Neural
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:57.120]   Virtual Care Solution, which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous ventilated patients
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:05.200]   simultaneously, helping to expand their capacity while reducing their risk of exposure.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.440]   As our digital healthcare journey continues, we're at the center of an ecosystem striving
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.720]   for precision health.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:17.880]   I'm very proud of the work our team is doing to combat COVID-19.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:23.800]   Moving to power on slide 13, we'll talk to the current trending in the second quarter
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:29.200]   to date in dynamics of gas power and power portfolio.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:33.520]   Starting with gas power equipment, while we're monitoring and managing supply chain disruptions,
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:39.960]   as of today, we still see a path to 45 to 50 gas turbine deliveries this year.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:44.280]   But our orders profile and therefore cash down payments worth several hundred million dollars
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:51.100]   are likely weaker due to IPP pressures in the U.S. and Mexico is we expect that deal financing
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.000]   will become harder through the year.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.840]   Additionally, with oil price pressure impacting Middle East and SSA investment, including demand
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.080]   for new LNG, we are expecting a longer road to normalization.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:13.280]   Ultimately, we're sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin accretive backlog
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.960]   with disciplined execution.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.280]   In services, approximately 20% of planned averages are shifting from the first half
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.920]   of this year due to COVID-19 field labor constraints.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:28.680]   We're also seeing pressure on upgrades, primarily in the Middle East, where low oil prices are
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.160]   impacting customer budgets.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:36.560]   We are seeing GE gas turbine utilization in the U.S. up mid single digits due to low gas
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:42.640]   prices in the ship from coal, but utilization globally is down low double digits due to
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.840]   lower electricity demand.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.280]   In power portfolio, our steam business is most impacted; factory closures pressured our steam
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:56.600]   operations, including one facility in Wuhan, which was closed for approximately eight weeks
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.040]   in the first quarter.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.680]   Today, we're back up to more than 70% of capacity.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.400]   The global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in India driven by government
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   restrictions.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.400]   Overall, we're seeing about 30% of outages shift from the first half of this year to
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:19.520]   the second half, with another 10% to 15% pushing into next year.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   Our power businesses are taking several measures to offset these pressures.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:30.560]   In the first quarter, we reduced head count by 700, notified approximately 1,300 contractors,
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:35.720]   implemented a hiring freeze, and in line with the demand profile, we are taking even further
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.440]   actions.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:44.600]   This will serve to reduce fixed cost in 2020 and drive benefits in 2021.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.720]   Looking forward, we're tracking a number of items, including timing of our gas turbine
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:53.840]   new order closure, service outages and volume, leak utilization is the energy mix, and fuel
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:59.800]   prices are impacting each region differently, supplier impacts and project execution, billing
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.440]   milestones and customer collections.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:08.840]   We're targeting to have our accelerated cost out measures drive organic margin expansion
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.440]   despite these demand changes.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.960]   Moving to slide 14 on renewables, there was a limited impact of COVID-19 in the first
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:23.680]   quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.240]   As we've said, we think about renewables and three distinct operating pools.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:33.680]   Starting with onshore wind, while we continue to deliver at record levels in the Americas,
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.720]   we are seeing supply chain disruption at our LM wind facilities, and we're monitoring key
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:45.960]   commercial milestones such as permitting and financing, which could potentially cause timing delays.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:51.580]   In offshore wind, certification for our industry leading turbine, the Holyad X, remains on
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.580]   track.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:59.480]   We're also on plan to start delivering on our 80 unit 6 megawatt commitments to EDF.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.800]   After completion of this project in 2021, we expect to start shifting production to the
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   Holyad X.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:10.520]   We're also monitoring financial closure of 2020 deals.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:16.060]   Grid and hydro, our two turnarounds, are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.880]   of our grid facilities now operating below full capacity.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:26.320]   In a grid automation, we're also impacted by lower book to bill order conversion.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:30.700]   Across all three of these pools, we're increasing cost out and restructuring, and we've identified
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:34.480]   several hundred million dollars of additional actions.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.080]   Longer term, a lower cost structure will benefit renewables.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:43.360]   Relating to the global supply chain, we're focused on the safe reopening of our plants
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:48.760]   globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.000]   Before we were expecting a larger impact on COVID-19 in the second quarter.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.920]   By business, we're tracking 20 and 21 demand impact on progress collections and potential
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.860]   site delays in onshore wind.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:06.080]   The risk of financing delays associated with deals at offshore project site delays at grid
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:11.920]   and hydro and the backlog at grid.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.080]   On slide 15, within GE Capital, our GCAPs and insurance businesses are where we are feeling
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.800]   the largest impacts, so I'll keep my comments focused there.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:26.720]   First, GCAPs is better positioned today than in previous downturns, with better asset quality,
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.520]   less customer concentration and more geographic diversity.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:37.200]   That said, we're preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments, as well as lease restructurings,
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:42.480]   and we've had approximately 80% of our customers seek short term deferrals.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:49.160]   As you may have seen, we've agreed with Boeing on rebalancing of our 737 match order book.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:54.720]   Second at insurance, market and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.800]   portfolio and reinvestment yields.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.880]   Therefore, we're deploying capital to capture market dislocation investment opportunities.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:08.880]   We're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.480]   And similar to the industrial segments, we're implementing incremental cost and cash actions.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.880]   Looking forward, we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales at GCAPs
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.600]   and insurance.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   Our seasoned teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.280]   So to close, our priorities are clear.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:34.800]   We rapidly mobilized our team in the face of COVID-19, with our top priority being the
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.520]   health and safety of our employees.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:44.640]   And overall, the priorities we reviewed with you at the Outlook call remain intact.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.880]   We're facing into our near term realities while continuing to manage GE for the long term.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:55.240]   When the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century, our team is rising to the challenge
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:00.320]   with humility, transparency and focus.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:05.680]   We continue to deliver value for our customers, enabling air carriers to transport essential
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.680]   goods, supplying vital health care equipment and keeping the lights on.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.280]   And while there are many unknowns, there will be another side.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.120]   Planes will fly again.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.800]   Health care will normalize and modernize.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.320]   And the world still needs more efficient, resilient energy.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.040]   At the same time, we're embracing this new reality.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:31.920]   We're redefining winning and we're executing our plan.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:38.640]   The costs and cash that we've taken you through this morning are a major result.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:44.120]   These moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multi-year transformation to make GE a
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.680]   stronger, number and more valuable company.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.380]   And I am confident that GE will emerge stronger.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.400]   With that, Steve, let's go to questions.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.400]   Great.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:01.720]   Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:07.520]   again and ask one question and a followup so we can get to as many people as possible.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   Brandon, can you please open the line?
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.000]   Yes, thank you, sir.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.160]   We'll now begin the question and answer session.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.520]   If you have a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:20.640]   If you'd like to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.320]   If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up your handset first before dialing.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.360]   Once again, if you have a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.640]   And from vertical research, we have Jeff Sprague.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.680]   Please go ahead.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.160]   Thank you.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.160]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.640]   I hope everyone is well.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.000]   Thanks for all the great details.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Morning, Jeff.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Good morning.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:51.160]   I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on how you kind of view the asset
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:55.200]   quality of the contractual service agreements and the like.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:01.800]   There's a lot of assets there, obviously there's at least a temporary impairment of cash flows.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.080]   How does that test work?
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.360]   Have you done it yet?
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.720]   And are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should be thinking about?
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:24.920]   Jeff, I think if we look at the service backlog, broadly, just under $325 billion
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:31.100]   for the company, the vast majority of that $234 billion is in aviation.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.860]   I suspect that's where you're most focused.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:44.280]   We go through those backlog reviews and the CSA reviews on a regular basis.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:52.120]   What we've done here over the last, we call it the last seven, eight weeks, is really tighten
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:51:00.400]   and quicken the review process that we do with the businesses, both at aviation and at GCAS.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:08.000]   What we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest and, if you will, most accurate
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.440]   information possible with respect to customer risk given everything that's going on.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.920]   So we do that on a regular basis.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:23.540]   We did that at the end of the first quarter in closing, much as we do every quarter.
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:32.360]   Clearly we've got a fluid situation and I think the modest charges that we took, the modest
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.700]   changes in the first quarter, clearly are going to play out as we go through the course of
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.700]   the year.
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.880]   We can't really scope that for you today.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:47.880]   If you look at the CSA book in aviation, for example, as we went through the mechanics
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:54.520]   of the future billings, the future costs related to those billings, based on the information
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:00.660]   at the time, it was really just $100 million adjustment, non-cash, of course, which is
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:04.760]   why you see a little bit of the earnings cash dynamic.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:12.480]   Today, as we go forward, we're going to be updating those adjustments and, again, we would
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:18.680]   expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines are doing with their planes.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:24.920]   But I think it's important to keep in mind, again, these are 10 to 15 year agreements,
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:32.240]   as you know, and those adjustments are taken in the context of that particularly extended
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   time period.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   Thanks for that.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:41.000]   Just as a follow-up, if I could, I know you don't want to get real precise on guidance,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.480]   but you are pointing us to a further decline in cash flow in Q2, which isn't surprising
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:56.000]   quite frankly, but could you bracket that at all for us, what we should expect for Q2 and
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.680]   any high-level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint?
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:09.920]   Yes, Jeff, I think that we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and didn't want
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:16.520]   to take an attempt at framing formal guidance here today, in light of all of this flu and
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.400]   all of it is still evolving here.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:24.800]   I think the tack we took was really to try to share as much with you as we possibly could
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:31.280]   in terms of the April detail of business by business and acknowledge that we're going
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:37.680]   to see a more challenging second quarter here given the full impact of COVID and the like.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:41.080]   But beyond that, I think that's really where we are.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:45.480]   We know we've got to get to work on the cost and the cash actions.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:51.360]   That's why you see it's doubling, that activity and aviation, stepping it up elsewhere around
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.360]   the company.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:54:00.480]   So the $2 billion of cost, the $3 billion of cash will clearly help us later on in the
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.960]   year as those actions take root.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.520]   But for today I think that's really what we're -- that's what we know and that's what we're
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.560]   comfortable sharing.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.560]   Thanks.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:16.480]   Best of luck, Larry, thanks.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.480]   From Morgan Stanley.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   Thanks, Jeff.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:26.920]   Please go ahead.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:31.640]   Josh, your line is open, might be on mute.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.800]   Josh, you might be on mute.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.520]   Josh, you there?
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:43.200]   Why don't we -- Brandon, let's move on and come back to Josh.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   Okay.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.200]   Sure.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.200]   Next question we have from Bank of America.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   We have Andrew Oben.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.200]   Please go ahead.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.200]   Okay.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   Yes, good morning.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.200]   Can you hear me?
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.200]   Andrew?
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.200]   Yep.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   Andrew?
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   Yeah, just a question.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.200]   I can hear you.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:04.120]   Thank you so much and good luck to everybody.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:10.160]   So run rate minus 60 percent in terms of shop visits, 50 percent on CSAs.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.680]   Do you think you continue to trend at this level in the second quarter or is there more
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:20.680]   downside?
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:25.840]   Andrew the -- I think you're referring to page nine and the slide deck.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.840]   Yeah, the aviation.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:30.000]   I think this is what we're seeing here.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.600]   Yeah, I think this is what we're seeing right now, right?
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:44.160]   And given what the carriers have said publicly what they're doing, we think these are good
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.780]   likely near-end run rates to share with you.
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:53.520]   Again, we're not trying to offer up a definitive view as to the next several quarters, but this
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.760]   is what we're seeing right now in the second quarter for sure.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:06.520]   And my follow-up question on spare engine sales I think minus 60 percent.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:11.880]   Have we lost these or will these come back when the situation normalizes?
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:17.400]   So you can give us some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.400]   the next couple of years.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:24.200]   Thank you so much.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:34.360]   Andrew we were ramping spares with both the LEAP 1A and the LEAP 1B as the narrow body
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:42.720]   market was taking off, typical early in the life of an engine activity.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:50.160]   We are clearly seeing that soften not necessarily going to zero as preparations are being made
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:54.680]   for the return to service to the max, right?
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:59.040]   I don't think that opportunity is lost, but I think like much of what we're seeing in
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.880]   aviation broadly it will be pushed out for a few years.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:09.940]   And again, I don't think we're taking a definitive view as to what year, what quarter things
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:18.480]   get back to, if you will, a normalized 2019 level, but we recognize the discussions out
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:25.560]   there about this being a multi-year recovery, gradual, slow, I think we're embracing that
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:33.040]   reality and that applies really across the portfolio both on the OE side as well as the
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.320]   aftermarket spares included.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.600]   Thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.320]   Thank you.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:47.640]   From Abelius Research, we have Scott Davis, please go ahead.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:52.180]   Hey, good morning guys and welcome Carolina.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.180]   Thank you.
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:58:01.400]   Good morning Larry, any way to think about the cost actions as it relates to kind of structural
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:06.760]   versus more kind of pandemic short-term related?
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:17.520]   Sure, well I would say Scott, as you well know, that when we're in a mode like this, you're
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:22.800]   moving as quickly as you possibly can almost anywhere that you can.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:28.520]   So if you look at what we've announced in aviation, the doubling of those activities today, the
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:37.160]   broadening across the company, if you look at the tally today, there is a decidedly short
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:43.980]   term bias there, that Carolina and I are going to be working with the CEOs over the coming
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:49.280]   weeks to transition to a more permanent action, right?
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:54.960]   If you look at what we did in aviation, for example, in terms of the temporary lack of
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:59:00.540]   costs, that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure and that business on a variable
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:07.400]   basis to these shockingly fast changes in demand.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:13.920]   You might categorize that as temporary, we need to work through the changes on a more permanent
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:19.280]   basis that are required in light of the length of the recovery that we're looking at.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:25.800]   So we have confidence in these numbers that we're sharing today, the two billion of costs,
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:31.360]   the three billion of cash, there's a bit of a tactical bias today just given how fresh
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:37.800]   this is, but we will be leaning in toward making more of them permanent, recognizing that at
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:43.840]   the end of the day there will be a bit of a mix, be it head count related, discretionary
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:49.560]   spend on the cost side in addition to some of the working capital and certainly the cap
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:55.280]   X reduction, the Carolina reference, the 25% reduction year on year.
[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:04.960]   So a lot going on and by no means is this, these headlines today, the end, it's very much a
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.520]   working in progress.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:15.060]   Okay, that's helpful area and we think the $20 billion came to you pretty much about perfect
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:22.400]   timing, but does that money just have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as is for
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.400]   the year?
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.760]   Or is it just such a big number you can start to parse some of it out thinking in terms of
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:37.440]   whittling down some of the, you know, debt that you can manage?
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:46.160]   Well we, it did come at a, at a good time, there's no question, that's why we put the
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:54.720]   emphasis in the biopharmists setup on certainty, right, we wanted to take the market risk off
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:59.960]   the table relative to thinking through the health care options.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:06.720]   Carolina, anything you want to add relative to kind of managing liquidity versus leverage
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.720]   right here?
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.720]   Do you think?
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:15.560]   Yeah, I think it's important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared to
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.360]   before COVID and it's very important for us, of course leverage is important, but liquidity
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:26.800]   is very important and we end the quarter with 47 billion cash, right, and that's really
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:33.560]   to cover 18 billion of DENG capital long-term debt maturity is now through 21 and actually
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:39.760]   after the April actions we are down to 13 billion of maturity for 2021, almost all of that team
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.760]   in capital.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:46.380]   And I would also say, you know, we expect to have around 20 billion in total credit line
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:51.560]   going forward and that's really in line with our risk appetite, we have the new 15 billion
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:57.920]   three-year RCF that I mentioned and five billion credit lines will be on 20 billion of credit
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.960]   lines and I think we just say that, you know, we really intend to maintain a high level of
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.800]   cash, I would say, to maximize flexibility and that's why we're taking these actions also
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:14.360]   to be risk or balance sheet and basically prudently manage our liquidity in this very challenging
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.160]   external environmental time.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:22.880]   That makes sense and thank you and good luck to you guys.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.880]   Thank you.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.880]   Thanks Scott.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.880]   Be well.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.440]   And let's try Josh Porters-Winsky again from Morgan Stanley.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.440]   Please go ahead sir.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.560]   Hi guys, can you hear me this time?
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.560]   Yes.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.560]   Yes.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.960]   Clearly Josh, good morning.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:42.600]   Awesome and hope everyone is as well that go earlier comments.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:48.960]   Larry, can you just give us a sense and I know you guys have data going back eons and in aviation,
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:56.440]   how the impact of retirements and cannibalizations, you know, kind of make more of a U shape versus
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:02.960]   you know, what, you know, the air traffic may look like, is there a natural lag between
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:08.240]   when folks start flying again and when shop visits can happen just as a function of kind
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:15.880]   of using up some of the runtime on otherwise idle assets?
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:23.040]   Well Josh, certainly we have revisited the history and the team is well versed in what
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.840]   we have seen in years past.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:36.320]   Not sure we've seen anything kind of on par with this, but there's no question that there's
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:42.840]   going to be a bias on the part of some as some of these fleet reductions play out to retire
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:52.200]   some of the older aircraft and that will factor into the aftermarket, much like some of the
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:58.280]   dynamics around green time and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash,
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.960]   try to preserve cash in their business.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:08.880]   So I'm not sure that there is necessarily an exact model that captures what all the carriers
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.080]   and aggregate are going to do here, a model that offers great precision.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.760]   I think we do know that the combination of these factors is going to create pressure
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.440]   for us, for us here in the short term.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:28.280]   I think what's most important for our business really is cycles, much more so than revenue
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:35.760]   passenger miles and as we see schedules come back, as we work our way through the pandemic,
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:42.080]   that will put us back on I think better footing, but here in the short term, I think we're
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.400]   acknowledging that we're going to see shop visits and CSA buildings take on some real
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.600]   pressure due to the downturn.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.600]   Understood.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.600]   Thanks.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   I'll leave it there.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:59.560]   From JP Morgan, we have Steve Toussaint.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.560]   Thanks Josh.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.560]   Hey guys, good morning.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:06.160]   Hey Steve, good morning.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.720]   In early March, you guys had that slide that showed $2 to $4 billion in free cash flow
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.040]   guidance, which is obviously off the table, but you also talked about things growing and
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:24.440]   $21 and $22 and off that kind of $3 billion base, I think most research and numbers I saw
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:32.000]   were kind of in that $6 billion range of free cash flows, a kind of growth off of that level.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:40.480]   Are we still, are the out year numbers still at all legit or are you kind of withdrawing
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:46.840]   that long-term outlook as well?
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:53.640]   Steve, I think we have admittedly been focused on taking the right actions, both the cost,
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:59.960]   the cash, the balance sheet actions here in the short term, in the face of this unprecedented
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   pandemic.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:08.720]   We've taken guidance off for the year, we're not putting it back on today, just given the
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.120]   undue uncertainty of it all, right?
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:18.120]   So I don't think we're trying to get out any further than that.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.800]   I appreciate the question, but I think for purposes of today, we're really just trying
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:29.480]   to frame for folks what we're seeing, but that said, however long it takes us to work
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:35.280]   through this, I think we feel very good about our ability to come out stronger and get back
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.880]   on a positive cash flow growth trajectory.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   Got it.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.840]   Carolina, anything you would add to that?
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:52.560]   Well, no, I think it's important to acknowledge that by taking out costs now and part of it
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:58.160]   being structural, that gives us sort of, as well as mitigating the decrementals that
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:04.360]   help improving the incrementals, the outer years, I mean, that will depend on the recovery
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:11.040]   on the industries as well, so that's, I would say, what was impossible to speak to today.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.960]   Right, and I guess how much on that structural raw side?
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.960]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:23.600]   Yeah, just one other point I think worth mentioning, and I think what we're acknowledging here is
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.080]   that assistance played out in March and what we're seeing already in April, right?
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:35.240]   It really is hitting us from a mixed perspective hard, our highest margin businesses are really
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.760]   feeling it here.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:44.880]   I would think that on the recovery, we would see it swing the other way, so when we get
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:53.440]   back and come off the bottom, we should have a positive mix of fact, really across the
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.920]   board, particularly in aviation and healthcare.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.440]   Your second question, Steve, is relative to the cost actions and how much are permanent,
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.400]   how much not permanent?
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.140]   Yeah, I know, I guess how much is that going to cost you, I mean, like, you know, to come
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:14.560]   up with two to three billion dollars of cost and cash, you know, you've cut your restructuring
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:19.840]   last year pretty significantly into a couple hundred million in the first quarter, I mean,
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.960]   most companies kind of one for one, how much is this stuff going to cost you this year on
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:30.960]   a cash basis?
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:37.840]   Yeah, I think what we have said previously is we were going to be down off last year from
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.340]   an expense and from a cash perspective.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:46.600]   I think we're probably going to end up more or less in line, right, keep in mind that some
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:55.040]   of the cost actions, like furloughs, don't carry restructuring charge with that, right,
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.040]   because they aren't permanent.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.480]   So part of what we're trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary cost.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:05.760]   But all the while, if we can make more structural moves, we want to make sure we've got room
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.760]   to do that.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.480]   But I'd say right now, assume that it's going to be relatively flat year on year, but Carolina
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:17.900]   indicated in her remarks, we want to try to do more if we can.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:18.900]   Great.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.900]   All right.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:20.900]   Thanks so much.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:21.900]   Best of luck, guys.
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:22.900]   Thanks, Steve.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:25.400]   From UBS, we have Marcus Mederbauer.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.400]   Please go ahead.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   Hi.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.120]   Good morning, Larry, Carolina and Steve.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.040]   Let me maybe follow up on the -- Marcus, good morning.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.040]   Hey.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040]   Good morning.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:44.000]   So within the year, in your 10Q, you referenced the EATA numbers of 48% RPK reduction.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.800]   And I know obviously flight hours and RPKs are two different stories, but is that sort
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:56.440]   of a kind of scenario that you're flying through internally and I'm just trying to get a sense
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:02.360]   of what that would mean if we look at our sort of like 19 aviation cash as a baseline, sort
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:08.600]   of like where, you know, on that type of scenario, we could end up particularly, you know, looking
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:15.240]   at sort of what you've mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have, I think 62% of engines
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.720]   build ahead of shop visit one, which arguably are the engines that are on the narrow bodies
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.960]   coming back first because they're probably the youngest in the fleet and just trying to
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:33.080]   get a sense of within the year how you're thinking about stuff.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:42.240]   Well, I think that given what we highlighted relative to the April experience and the near
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:48.960]   term projection of that, there's no question that we're going to continue to see the pressure
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:58.400]   on cash at aviation that we've seen here lately, right, and that will be undoubtedly our biggest
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.400]   headwind.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:11.000]   No, sure, but, you know, shop visit, we heard sort of the numbers that you said, but did
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:19.240]   you do sort of internal stress tests around where you could end up with that?
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.920]   Is that just something that you say it's too early to comment?
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:36.520]   No, no, no, there's plenty of planning for, again, an extended slowdown here, we're embracing
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.600]   this reality to the fullest extent possible.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.000]   We are not expecting this to bounce back in the near term.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.160]   So we flag in the queue the IOTA numbers, we also reference others, you see it in our
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:56.400]   own departure data here in April, right, we are way down that has a direct feed in the
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.920]   shop visits, CSA billings and the like.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:09.440]   So we're adapting to this new environment confident that it will recover, but we're simply not
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:20.120]   trying to assume the pressure abates anytime soon, witness the cost and the cash actions
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.280]   that we're taking.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.040]   Sure, okay, no, I appreciate that.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:30.440]   And maybe as a follow up quickly on the capital side, do you anticipate any change in the
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:35.960]   capital support there for insurance, in particular, you referenced that a little bit in the prepared
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:41.400]   remarks, I think 2 billion is sort of the current number, are you thinking about that
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.400]   at the moment?
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:53.240]   On the parent support to capital and on the insurance, let's take a step back then.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:13:02.960]   So in 19, the capital had an intrusion from DU of 4 billion, and the estimate for this
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.480]   year is 2 billion on insurance funding.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:14.160]   And those 2 billion, you know, that's significantly lower than the before, we estimated that
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.720]   the parent will need to support roughly in mind with this, with some variables are still
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:25.040]   open and that depends on the capital itself, right, the capital earnings, the LR2, the capital
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.240]   ending assets, liquidity level, but basically it's about 2 billion as it looks now.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:35.800]   And I would also say going forward, which is a great thing to follow up, we do continue
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.800]   to anticipate further funding.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.680]   And that would be again through a combination of the capital itself with the assets, liquidity
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:52.880]   and the future earnings and on top of that possible capital contributions from team.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.280]   Thank you.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:15.840]   So at Aviation, it sounds like you guys acknowledged that on the way up, the spare's business,
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:21.600]   the aftermarket, the $15 billion commercial, aftermarket business will lag ASM growth because
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:28.700]   of, you know, a younger fleet emerging, you know, a surge of use serviceable material and
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.600]   the like, hard outs.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:36.280]   And obviously lower spare's provisioning as the OE rates come down 30% to 50%.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:43.080]   I guess the first question is, when do you anticipate aviation free cash flow getting
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.080]   to break even?
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:50.640]   Is it even possible before calendar 22 in that type of environment?
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:58.440]   Then I have a follow-up.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:04.320]   I'm not, I'm not sure we would buy into the premise per se, right?
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:14.200]   I mean, we are a cycles business, much more so than any other indicator and those cycles
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:19.200]   are going to have to come back before the passengers do.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.440]   As you indicate, the age of the fleet will help us over time.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:30.080]   There could be some short term headwinds, but we'll see how that plays out.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:37.940]   I think what we're acknowledging here is that we've been hit from a free cash perspective
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:49.120]   in our biggest and best cash generator at Aviation, but we're really not getting into much more
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:56.400]   in terms of the free cash forecast on a multi-year basis.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400]   It's just too soon.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:03.680]   There's just too many moving pieces for us to be that before we're leaning at this point.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:04.680]   We wish we could be.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.520]   It's just not where we are.
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.520]   Okay.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.280]   And just to follow up, obviously 2020 is a tough year.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:19.760]   We're going to have some cash burn, 2021 unclear, but certainly doesn't seem like an aviation.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:24.000]   We're going to have a strong recovery.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.920]   So as we emerge from this, we're going to have more leverage and I guess the question is,
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.840]   you guys have made some asset sales to deleverage.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:41.600]   What else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster?
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:47.120]   Is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore that's
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:53.440]   different than what you've done over the past year?
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.200]   Thank you.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:06.960]   Well, I'm not sure I would say that there's a lot that is -- oh, please, Carolina.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:15.600]   But I was going to say that to do things that we haven't done in the last couple of years.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:26.880]   Well, I would just say at a high level, we are committed to our deleveraging target of
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.080]   less than two and a half times on the industrial side.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:35.440]   And I think you've seen us make a lot of progress year to date, which I hope underscores the
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:42.480]   seriousness of that objective, both on the GE side, right, I think it's $7 billion of debt
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:48.840]   reductions in the quarter and the capital, I think it's up to $10 on a year to date basis,
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.680]   given some of the things we did in April.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:58.400]   Clearly it's going to take us a while longer here to hit those targets, like I suspect
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.560]   most companies.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.960]   But in terms of doing anything new or different, I think we're going to continue to try to run
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:12.400]   these businesses as best we can, be as disciplined as we can on the capital front, be smart and
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:18.600]   thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations, like pension, as you've seen us, relative
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.480]   to the plan design and some of the settlement options.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:27.600]   So I'm not sure there are necessarily new plays per se, but we'll continue to look at
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:32.240]   every and every option available to continue to strengthen the company, strengthen the
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:37.760]   balance sheet, bring those leverage levels down in the face of COVID-19.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.840]   Caroline, I'm sorry, I jumped in there.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:43.400]   Anything to add there?
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:48.520]   I would just add to the leverage comment also the liquidity that at times like this, you
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:53.680]   know, you do look at the liquidity and I think it's important to say that we really want to
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:59.480]   maintain a high level of cash maximizer flexibility and you have seen the de-risking activities
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:05.040]   that we have made to sort of push out the debt in the further years.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.280]   So we keep optionality.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.280]   Thank you.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.720]   And I think to that it's just important for us all to remember we ended the quarter with
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:22.440]   47 billion of liquidity on the back of the biopharma action and some of the other things
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.440]   that we have done.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:29.440]   So we'll continue to be nimble and flexible, mindful of our obligations and our reality.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:38.040]   Okay, from Barclays we have Julian Mitchell, please go ahead.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.040]   Hi.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.880]   Good morning.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.280]   Maybe just the question...
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.280]   Where are you Julian?
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.280]   Good morning.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:51.000]   Maybe just the first question around the working capital dynamics and the free cash flow at
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   aviation.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:59.800]   I guess, you know, there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:05.520]   down draft, you get a working capital cash offset to an extent and then it reverses whenever
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.760]   the sales come back.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:13.640]   Could you just update us on how you see the working capital cash impact at G Aviation sort
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:19.200]   of in the early stages now in this downturn, what you would expect to happen to working
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:25.600]   capital when things recover and if there's any major difference on the cash dynamics
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:32.880]   of the power by the hour type service relative to the ad hoc spares activity in aviation.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:39.320]   Julian, I would say...
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:56.520]   Yeah, with respect to working capital, I think our primary challenge is really inventory
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.520]   at aviation, right?
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:04.800]   We came into this year knowing we were going to have to adjust to a different schedule
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:13.320]   with the max chasing the step up at Airbus with the 320neo while dealing with a good bit
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:21.080]   of past due on the commercial side, both OE and aftermarket while having pretty good military
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.800]   demand to contend with.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:31.760]   That all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from a cash flow perspective
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:38.080]   was an inventory at aviation in the quarter so that's where we're going to be most focused
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:44.240]   trying to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies, adjust to the reduced production schedules,
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:51.240]   the lower aftermarket requirements while continuing to take care of the military business.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:22:00.040]   That's a complex supply chain undertaking but the team as you can imagine is keenly focused
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:05.480]   on using some of the lean tools, working with our supply base to make sure that we not only
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:14.640]   take the cost out of the business but bring those inventory levels down in light of current
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.640]   demand.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.640]   But should we expect?
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.640]   So I guess...
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.640]   Julian...
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   Yep.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:31.160]   There's a second part of your question I may have missed that.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:37.840]   In aviation you have the drop in EBITDA in the downturn and the recovery in EBITDA in
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.280]   the early part of the upturn.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:46.240]   I was just trying to understand on working capital is that cash impact counter cyclical
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:52.960]   or is it pro cyclical so you're getting a working capital outflow through the downturn
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:23:02.560]   as well as the EBITDA decline?
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.680]   I understand the high level dynamic there that you're alluding to.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.880]   I think right now the simple reality of aviation given the pressures and the cross currents
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.800]   is that it is a negative and we need to work to improve it.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:23.440]   How much of a tailwind could it be kind of at this point in the cycle?
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.240]   I think it's too early to tell.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:32.720]   We've got to get on the improvement path first Julian to be able to take that potential
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.160]   and deliver it in the financials as a reality.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.160]   Thank you.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:44.720]   The second question was just around the operational issues so I think it sounds like the cost
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:50.680]   out tailwind should build through the year but in Q1 you had some operational issues in
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:58.160]   power on the service side, steep decrementals even with the fixed cost down 16%.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.320]   Renewables the margins were down despite a big revenue increase.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:08.120]   So I guess what's the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:15.060]   these cost savings over the balance of the year?
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:20.400]   Well I think you have to take it business by business right?
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:28.400]   If you look at what happened in power clearly the push out by customers because of their
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:34.960]   own site restrictions and by us on the back of the travel restrictions really pushed a lot
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:42.320]   of high margin revenue out of the quarter and probably out of the first half.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:52.080]   That was on top of some cost pressures of our own making which we need to improve upon.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:25:01.520]   But I think in power I believe that the team is doing a very nice job working off the so
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:06.640]   called inheritance taxes driving real cost improvements you see that in the head count
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:12.180]   reductions here in the first quarter and as we get to a more normalized service environment
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:17.480]   I think you'll continue to see that turnaround continue to take flight.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.560]   I think in renewables Julian it's a different dynamic.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:28.760]   Yes we had phenomenal revenue growth in the quarter double the onshore turbine deliveries
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.640]   here in the U.S. got a little bit better price got about a point of price which is encouraging
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:42.000]   to see but it is by nature a very low gross margin business so the growth isn't high calorie
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.160]   unfortunately we had a few what we figure one offs but they're not one offs until they go
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.440]   away permanently cost and execution issues.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.440]   All the while the the turnarounds in hydro and grid are I think moving forward but it's
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:07.000]   early days and they have a number of inheritance taxes that will take a few years to work through.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.400]   So I think the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate those turnarounds
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:19.400]   in power and renewables they're dealing with different dynamics in the respective businesses
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.280]   and that's really why I think I have the confidence to say that you should expect the decremental
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:31.540]   margins sequentially to improve the restructuring and the cost actions should present themselves
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:41.000]   and improve decrementals in the back half but we've got work to do to make that happen.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.640]   Great thank you.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.180]   From Wolf Research we have Nigel Kohi please go ahead.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:49.840]   Thanks Julian.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:55.320]   Thanks good morning everyone and Karina great to see you on board so look we appreciate
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:03.080]   all the color in the slides and the additional color in the queue so Larry is it now a base
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:07.680]   case that industrial free cash flow will be negative and maybe just address the risk
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:13.920]   of significant you know cash burn this year or you know is there enough on the cost outs
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.640]   and working capital side to maybe mitigate some of that pressure and keep the industrial
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.920]   free cash relatively steady.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:32.540]   I think what we're trying to share this morning Nigel is that probably three things one we've
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:41.360]   been hit hard and fast here right in some of our most important highest margin businesses
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:50.200]   be it aviation and services particularly gas power services, PDX in health care.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:56.160]   We think that that gets worse before it gets better particularly here in the second quarter
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:05.600]   with a full effect it's uncertain as to how things play out from here we're going to acknowledge
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:12.960]   that uncertainty hence the pulling of the guide but we're not going to sit back and hope that
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.560]   it all passes we're not going to take the view that we've got a sharp debounce coming
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:23.080]   hence the two billion of cost actions we've talked about and the three billion of cash
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:30.760]   actions we're going to do everything we possibly can to control our destiny here without impairing
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:37.000]   the long-term value and the long-term trajectory of our company so we're telling you what we
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:44.140]   know today we wish we knew more but that is really the state of play right now and the
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:46.440]   approach the headset that we're taking to it.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:51.040]   Okay I appreciate that Larry thanks and then you know I thought one of the real highlights
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.480]   of the quarter was the underlying strengths of the health care margins you know X even X
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:00.440]   biopharma especially given some of the headwinds you face in there so we're seeing strengths
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.880]   in small equipment and pressure and big iron how does that mix look though when you look
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.760]   at the the the mix on smaller you know patient monitoring equipment etc versus the big iron
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:17.960]   how does that equipment mix play out to the margins.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:28.960]   Well we certainly I think the the key thing to keep in mind Nigel is the big iron certainly
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:40.960]   got hit the lower the lower ticket the lower price points be patient monitors ventilators
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:48.320]   and the like certainly got quite quite a boost but it's a small it's a small part of the
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:54.200]   of the business so there's a little bit of mix there but but not a lot it was really more
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:30:03.960]   function and frankly of the team doing a nice job more broadly recognizing that absent biopharma
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:11.280]   we needed to tend to the core cost structure and all its form in the ACS business right we've
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:16.440]   been growing health care biopharma leading the way we got some good margin support from
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:22.480]   that business the last several years well now as we think about the 17 billion dollar core
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:28.880]   the teams really I think put their sights the last couple of quarters on growing that business
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:33.980]   growing it with a creative margin and it's really the cumulative effect that I think you see
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:39.800]   a bit here in the first quarter before we we got hit they got hit a little bit later not
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:44.640]   as much you'll see more of that unfortunately here in the second quarter but I think you've
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:49.960]   got a team who thinks that like many other med tech companies they can grow mid or low to
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:58.080]   mid single digits over time and put more digital into the mix better cost that should give us
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:03.280]   the opportunity to grow with a creative margins along the lines of what Karen laid out in
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:08.480]   December and I have no less conviction about their ability to do that today than than we
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:14.320]   did when we made that presentation again mindful that we've got some gyrations here in the
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:22.960]   near term deal with right okay thanks Larry good luck thanks Nigel we are at the bottom
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:27.800]   of the hour so Brandon we're at the bottom of the hour so we could just take one more
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:34.880]   question sure from RBC Capital Markets we have Dean Dre please go ahead thank you good morning
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:44.040]   everyone wishing everyone good health and my welcome to Carolina thank you hey just good
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:51.840]   morning just two questions both aviation a lot of discussion about structural cost out
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:59.200]   and Larry be interested in how have you balanced the the structural cost out in aviation with
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:06.480]   riffs and balancing the riffs and furloughs versus how you might be compromising the ability
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:13.120]   to bounce back when it does ramp back up so that's the first question and then the second
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:18.400]   one just to make sure I heard it correctly were there did you quantify the leap cancellations
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:25.320]   in the quarter I know there's delivery deferrals our experience in 2008 was that you did not
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:31.120]   see many outright engine cancellations because customers would lose that nonrefundable deposit
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:39.720]   so what's the expectation here in terms of engine cancellations that's it for me thank
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:51.900]   you being maybe I'll take the first part of that and perhaps Carolina can take the second
[01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:58.760]   I think we are mindful ever mindful that there will be a recovery right and we want to be
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:06.360]   well positioned for this is going to be very good business for GE for four decades but
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:16.600]   I think we are really trying to again embrace our reality and take the cost actions in the
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:25.200]   aftermarket business and more broadly at aviation mindful that we've got a period of time here
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:30.720]   of an unknown duration but it's not going to be measured in months right where that business
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:36.400]   is going to be under considerable pressure so after a period of time is the aftermarket
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:43.720]   has grown as it has the last decade this is going to give us an opportunity to rethink
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:53.480]   to consolidate all the while mindful of our obligations to customers the nature of how
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:58.640]   the footprint has changed the changes that are probably still still coming so there there
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:04.360]   are a number of variables it's very much a work in progress as well but I think we've got line
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:11.960]   of sight to build on some of the temporary action to take permanent action to make sure
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:19.720]   that we we have a lean cost structure with adequate capacity to come out of the downturn
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:27.920]   here well positioned to perform both for customers and for investors thank you will not turn it
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:37.680]   back to Steve Whitaker for closing remarks we do want to answer the question on yeah go
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:45.160]   ahead Carolina yeah you were right because I actually mentioned that in my notes there
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:53.480]   that in our backlog which was flat sequentially enough 22% versus prior that did include roughly
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:35:01.560]   200 unit order translations in the quarter well I would say the progress refunds are
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:07.200]   very small so far but on top of that we also saw Gcast right so we have Gcast can solution
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:20.080]   on 69 I cough in April so that will be reflected in the second quarter evolution backlog great
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:25.200]   thanks everybody I know I know it's a long call and a busy day so if you need more just
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:34.940]   reach out to us and and that's a lot thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:37.600]   conference thank you for joining and you may now disconnect

[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I'm Vic Kinney, Ingersoll Rand Investor Relations Leader and with me today are Vicente Randall, Chief Executive Officer and Emily Weaver, Chief Financial Officer.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Our earnings release, which was issued this morning and a supplemental presentation, which will be referenced during the call,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   In addition, a replay of this morning's conference call will be available later today.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that certain of the statements on this call are forward-looking in nature
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call.

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   which are available on our website at www.irco.com.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Additional disclosure regarding forward-looking statements is included on slide 2 of the presentation.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   in our slide presentation and in our release, which are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I will also remind everyone that in both our earnings release and today's presentation,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   we have included both as-reported financials and supplemental financial information to assist with analysis and comparatives.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   The as-reported financials only include the Ingersoll-Ren industrial segment results
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   from the closing date of the transaction on February 29, 2020,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and the supplemental financial information provides results as the transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2018
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   to provide a full quarter of comparable results.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Turning to slide 3, on today's call, we will provide an update on the top priorities of the company in the current operating environment
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as review our first quarter total company and segment highlights.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We will conclude today's call with the Q&A session.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   to allow for enough time for other participants.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   At this time, I will now turn it over to the Santérenault chief executive officer.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Thanks Rick and good morning to everyone on the call.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I would like to kick off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by COVID-19
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and all the dedicated healthcare workers, first responders and volunteers who are on the front lines
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   all over the world battling this pandemic.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll-Ren employees around the world.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The pictures on slide 4 are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   who have adapted to the realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Every day I hear of new examples of our businesses providing mission critical products to our customers
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   one thing I am sure about is that Ingersoll-Ren will continue to keep the safety of our communities
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and serving our customers at the center of everything we do
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Moving to slide 5, I would like to grant everyone on the critical priorities we are following during these challenging times.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   When we close the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   that within a matter of weeks we will be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruptions to our customers supply chain
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   and the day-to-day operations of the company.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us plan, accelerate and adapt our actions
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers and the community.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   through these uncertain times.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And finally continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The strength of Ingersoll-Ren team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge from this crisis
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   as a stronger and more unified company.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine that we call IRX
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   are really at the heart of how we operate as a company especially in these unprecedented times.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   During the integration process we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   One that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   This purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams leave on a daily basis creates a framework
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   of what we want to achieve as a company and the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll-Ren execution excellence process.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll-Ren.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Turning to slide seven, I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis since it has been swift and focused around two mega components.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   First is the health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And second, business continuity not only within operations but across the larger supply chain.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Starting first with health and safety we activated our COVID-19 tax force in February
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   and had a full coordinated company approach in early March just weeks after the creation of the new company.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Our execution approach has served us very well as we are able to quickly implement enhanced site safety protocols
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And it is encouraging that our quick actions have been successful as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   But it is more than just implementing safety protocols, it is also about supporting and engaging the employee base.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   As a result we have implemented a number of measures including a global outreach program to facilitate employee feedback.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Not only did our team volunteers take individual pay cuts, furloughs and forgo vacation time this year,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   they have thoughtful in-depth suggestions, many of which were actively implementing today.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   From our business continuity perspective, starting first with our operations, as we previously communicated,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   we have seen plans largely in China, Italy and India impacted due to COVID-19.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   China was largely impacted in the month of January and February and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   as things are now largely back to normal.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Italy and India saw about a two month lag to China with operations being impacted in late March and into April.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And in this time our sites around the globe are 98% operational with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The supply chain has seen a similar trend as the impact in China is largely behind us
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   The Americas and the media regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   In the past few weeks we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Much like our operations India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of May when governmental restrictions begin to ease.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   We are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Let me tell you about what we're doing here.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Starting with slide 8 through the use of IRX we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over $350 million
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   with increases across all major savings categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   As a reminder we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost energies
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   of approximately $250 million by the end of year 3 after closing.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energies
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and the associated stand up of the new company.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters the facing of synergy delivery
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   We have dramatically increased the pace having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   with approximately $70 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The majority of these savings are coming from head count actions already taking in the past two months
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   In addition we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative with RFQs for nearly one third
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   of our historical direct materials fan base already launched as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   In total we are now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   which is approximately three times higher than the original year 1 expectation of 10% to 15% realization.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   We are keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three year time frame
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   at this time to remain prudent on volume dependent synergies like procurement
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and I have to be given the current environment.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It is not only the structural cost that we have taken out but also how we are supplementing
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short-term cost reductions to protect margins.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So let's move to slide nine to talk about that.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   In Q1 despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   we were able to limit adjusted imita decrementals to less than 30%.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   With the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   we expect that these additional actions would yield 40 to $50 million of incremental cost savings
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   in the PNL this year with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   We will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if the man environment does not accelerate
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   in the second half of the year we will potentially extend some of these actions
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and increase our savings target accordingly.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   While we are making some tough decisions to control cost one area that we are not cutting back
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Much like we did back in 2015 at Georgia Denver when we invested through the downturn
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   to capitalize on market share gains and new product opportunities.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   We are following the same playbook today.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as demand generation and our IOT platforms.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   This is all part of the strategy to play offense now especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Moving to slide 10 let me talk about liquidity.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   At the time of the merger we took the opportunity to reprise our legacy debt
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   while placing the new $1.9 billion firm loan to close the transaction.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   All of our debt is a term loan B structure with very attractive pricing
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   as the U.S. components are LIBOR +175 and the Euro component is a EuroBOR +200.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The firm loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   and there are no maturities until 2027.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   as we finish the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and over $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   As we look ahead we continue to see several opportunities to own the cash
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Opportunities exist across working capital and cash taxes
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense in the second half of the year
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   will expire by September of 2020.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   given the attractive rate and covenant environment.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Turning to slide 11, our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   as we're building the culture of Inglisle Rand with our employees at the core.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   and at the same time we will position the company for future growth both organically
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   and through opportunistic targeted Bolton M&A.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Our business operates in a very fragmented market
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And importantly our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   is taking shape as we launch several of our ESG-oriented initiatives already.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Overall we have several value creation levers as we look ahead
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain macroeconomic landscape.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   I will now turn it over to Emily to work you through the financials. Emily?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Thanks Vicente. On slide 12 you will see the as reported financials for the company.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   As a reminder the reported financials include three months of legacy Gardner Denver
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and one month of the legacy Inglisle Rand industrial segment in Q1 2020
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   As a result the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Other than to mention that the as reported net income in the quarter
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   includes $197 million of amortization, acquisition, restructuring and other adjustments
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Turning to slide 13, to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   as if it had happened as of January 1, 2018.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   From a total company perspective FX suggested revenue and orders
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   declined 14% and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Regionally we saw notable declines in Asia Pacific
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   as well as sharp declines in the U.S. and Europe towards the end of the quarter
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   most notably in the ITNS segment.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   This led book to bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   The company delivered 208 million of adjusted EBITDA
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   a decline of 24% driven mostly by the volume declines in ITNS
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and the expected downturn in the HPF segment.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4% down 200 basis points from last year.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   However, our proactive cost controls within the business
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   limited decrementals to 29%.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   the legacy Gardner Denver business delivered 97 million
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately 100 million
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   The legacy IR businesses delivered 51 million of adjusted EBITDA
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   in March as opposed to a combined 60 million for January and February.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Moving to slide 14, free cash flow for the quarter
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   was $60 million on an as reported basis including $8 million of CAPEX.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   The Q1 free cash flow includes $63 million of outflows
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   related to the transaction comprised of 38 million of synergy delivery
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   and standup related costs and another 25 million of transaction fees.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   We also paid $38 million of debt issuance costs in the quarter
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   bringing our total transaction related outflows in the quarter to $100 million.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   From a leverage perspective we finished at 2.6 times
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   and while we do expect to see some short term increase to leverage
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   we have shown the ability to delever historically.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   As you can see on the right side of the page we'll remain extremely disciplined on cash
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Specifically internal reinvestments for growth, prudent debt pay down
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   and opportunistic bulls on M&A.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   We have no plans for any share repurchases or dividend at this time.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segment. Vicente?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Thanks Emily. Starting first with industrial technologies and services on slide 15
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   the IT&S segment first quarter adjusted order intake was $889 million,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   down 9% versus prior year excluding effects.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Adjusted revenue in the quarter was $796 million, down 17% excluding effects
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and leading to a book to bill ratio of 1.12 times.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   From a regional perspective Asia-Pacific revenues were down in the mid 30s
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   with Europe down 15% and Americans down 7% all excluding effects.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   We use this trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   meaning that the APAC decline in Q1 is what we expect to see in America in the near term.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   but we're staying highly active with the man generation activities and pricing controls
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   but we continue to demonstrate disciplining price generating over 1% in the quarter.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   While these markets are more opaque than historically we're using our unique data acquisition strategy
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We break this out into two areas, aftermarket and original equipment.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   For aftermarket and leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   that are connected to our remote monitoring systems.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   In America and Europe we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few weeks of March
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   of nearly 30% with some recovery in the past few weeks of April.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   We're now using this as a way to know where our service teams need to focus
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   which is approximately 50% of the compressor business today.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   For original equipment we're using the man generation leads.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   We said in the past that the man gen was a leading indicator of orders
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   and we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks. With more than a thousand leads per week
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   we have a lot of commercial insight in our system.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   What we saw in the later weeks of March was a drop of 30% versus what we saw earlier in the quarter
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   with similar trends in America and Europe.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   but still approximately 20% to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Let me give you now some color from a product like Perspective.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers and vacuums
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   where we saw orders down in the mid to high single digits.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   We have spoken about third party industry reports in the past
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   According to a leading third party report the market in the U.S. was down
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   mid single digits in dollars in the first quarter.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Garnet Denver branded products were flat and Ingersoll brand branded product
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   down high single digits.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   But when you look into the details you see the power of the two companies.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   As Garnet Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   while Ingersoll brand took share on high horsepower compressors.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   as well as the direct and indirect channels that both companies have.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Power tools and lift which is part of this segment had a very tough quarter
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   with orders and revenue down both over 20%.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   that online retailers typically make in the first quarter
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   to support first half of the year revenue.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   However, this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   many online retailers switch their focus to household essentials.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Moving to non-gap at Yostaribita,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   ITNS delivered 135 million dollars in the quarter
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   which was down 25%.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Non-gap at Yostaribita margin was 17%
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   which was down 150 business points from the prior year.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Other cause mitigation efforts helped limit incremental to 25%
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   in a segment that typically has basic fundamentals of 35% to 40% before cost actions.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Moving to slide 16 to the precision and science technology segment.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Overall the segment had solid performance in this economic environment
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   as adjusted orders were 218 million up 2% XFX.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Adjusted revenue was 192 million down 9% XFX.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   On strong prior year comes up 12% XFX growth and shipment delays due to COVID-19.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   In the first quarter we saw orders growth high single digits
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   in the legacy medical pump business as we are leading key player
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   in several applications like oxygen concentrators, respirators and liquid handling.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into at the bottom of the page.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Our team have been working 24/7 providing modified solutions
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   that can be used for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down 2% XFX
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   with the majority due to COVID lockdowns in January and February in China
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and towards the end of the quarter in India.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in the more industrial end markets.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Moving to non-gap adjusted EBITDA PNST delivered 53 million down in the quarter
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   which is down 6%. Non-gap adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   up 120 basis points driven by strong cost controls and productivity
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   leading to incremental margins of only 15%.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Moving to slide 17 and the specialty vehicle technology segment
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   our priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   We see that this segment can expand margins with the use of the same IRX tools
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   we have used across other segments and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Adjusted orders were $230 million and adjusted revenue was $185 million
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   up 8% and 7% respectively with a boost to bill of 1.15.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Growth was driven by the strengthening gold connectivity and consumer product lines.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   The business saw strong double digit order momentum in early January and February
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   but as the pandemic hit the U.S. we saw sharp decline in the second half of March.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   What there is a lot to be excited about we are expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple reasons.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   First, last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   where some product was shifted to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And two, the business is not immune to this current environment.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   While April orders were down year-to-year, we are starting to see some sequential improvement in orders.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   We feel this is driven by a couple factors.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   First, in the consumer product line, the team people took quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   widely used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And second, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Moving to non-gap adjusted EBITDA specialty vehicles deliver $18 million in the quarter down 1%.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Non-gap adjusted EBITDA was 9.9% which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth investments and product mix.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Moving to slide 18 and the high pressure solution segment, the business performed above our expectations
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   in a top operating environment with adjusted orders of $84 million and adjusted revenues of $96 million,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   down 26% and 29% respectively.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   As expected, the revenue base in the business was nearly 90% aftermarket
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   and the team executed very well commercially with sequential adjusted orders of 6%
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and sequential adjusted revenues of 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   We continue to see shared gain opportunities in aftermarket
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   and specifically consumables where we saw orders and revenue up double digits sequentially.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   This allowed us to deliver non-gap adjusted EBITDA of $24 million on margins of 24.6%
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   which was down from last year level of 30.8% but sequentially better by over 400 basis points.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   As we pivot to the second quarter and rest of the year, a key leading indicator for this business
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   has always been activity and intensity. We can measure that in multiple ways
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   As a reminder, each fracked fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   With each truck carrying one pump, each pump has a fluid end
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   and every fluid end utilizes consumables.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   While Q1 and 2020 on average we saw 318 active fleets, the exit rate in March was 240.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter where we believe 50 active fleets
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   due to the recent dynamics in the market with the oversupply
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   and lower pricing for oil sinful impact on revenues within this segment.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Because of that we're taking very proactive stand to drive proper cost takeout
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Moving to slide 19, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of all.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Overall, the total company is down approximately 20% in orders
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   as the month began very slow, particularly in U.S. and European markets.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   By the order momentum throughout April, we expect total revenue to be low
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   in terms of orders both industrial technology and services
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and specialty vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   While precision and science technology is performing considerably better
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   with positive year over year orders performance thus far
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   as a result of continuous strength in medical pumps.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   And not surprisingly, the high pressure solution segment is down
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   as the market resets for what will likely be a prolonged downturn
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   that we expect will last for a number of quarters.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   As we look forward due to the uncertain environment that we found ourselves in
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   we will not be providing Q2 or total year to best manage our business
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   and ensure we're taking the right steps to manage multiple scenarios
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impact on cash flows.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   A current model shows that the business will need on an annual basis
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   to be cash flow break even using fairly conservative assumptions
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   around working capital and capital
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   coupled with the cost of actions we have taken thus far.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   We feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   when compared to current order trends
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   and coupled with our current liquidity position.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Trends is like 20 for some concluding remarks.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I want to say that what we manage through what we will know
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   that would be a tough second quarter.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   We feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has not changed.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Incluson Brand is a premier industrial company of our transformation.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   We have multiple levers for accelerating biocreation
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   while being very focused on the current part of our liquidity.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   With opportunities to increase these by unlocking cash
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   as well as taking advantage of the current rate environment
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   we will continue to drive a culture of execution
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   and we continue to pay attention to the particularly on the current conditions
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   to be strategic on both on acquisition.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   For this we will turn to the ONA.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   At this time I would like to remind everyone
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   in order to ask a question number one on your telephone keypad.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   If you would like to remove yourself from the queue
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   you may press the pound button.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Take yourself to one question.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Your first question comes from Andy Capilitz from Citigroup.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Your line is open.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Good morning guys, how are you?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Good morning Andy, how are you?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Vicente, can you give us more color into the April order declined?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   You're seeing your largest segment in ITNS.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   First of all, how long do you think the change in customer behavior
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   from that power tool business now have smaller ups and downs
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   than exposure in ITNS?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So are there discernible differences in the run rate
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   of these businesses given their more project
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   versus the industrial compressor business?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Yeah Andy, let me just give you a little bit of color.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   As you saw we said roughly April total order is down 20%,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   both to build greater than one.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   From a both to build perspective the industrial technology
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   and the position and signs were greater than one
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   obviously leading the way.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   I'll say in terms of ITNS in particular
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   I will categorize it as the short cycle was most impacted
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   in the quarter and continue to see some relatively
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   weakness here moving forward.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I mean it's mostly correlated to I guess maybe the PMI
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   from the down and the mainstream
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   which is what we consider to be more on the loan cycle.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I'll say comparatively a bit more stable in the first quarter
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and we continue to see maybe some of that in the month of April.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Again typically we tend to get the orders for that loan cycle
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   now in the first half of the year in order to get shipment
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   in the second half and from a PTO from a power tool perspective
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   yeah I mean rough quarter in Q1 as I alluded
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   I mean last year there were seeing some fairly good growth momentum
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   from their expansion into online retailers
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   and you saw that in the first quarter
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   many of these online retailers they moved
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   to having other kind of more household goods
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   or critical needs to fight COVID-19
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and clearly you know this business saw some of the impact.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I'll say April sale is relatively slow
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   so we haven't seen the people that were the momentum
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   of the power tool business.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   So that's helpful Vicente
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and I'm sure you especially asked
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   about decremental margin in some way
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   so let me just ask it like this
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   obviously good result in Q1 of close to 30
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   how do I think about decrementals with high pressure solutions
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   the order is down 80%
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   can you hold decrementals there in the mid 40s
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   at what point the fixed cost becomes a problem
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I know you talked about accelerated the rest of the business
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   can the rest of the business hold 30% decrementals
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   in the rest of the business?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Yeah so I'll say Andy I mean that's kind of what we're targeting for
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   and I mean as you have seen
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   you know we have performed well in the down cycles in the past
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   I think we have a good solid playbook
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   that we executed in the 1516
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   that included both not only in the industrial downturn
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   but also an upstream downturn
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   you know basic decrementals
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   they tend to be around 40% across the business
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   with slightly higher in businesses like the high pressure
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   as you mentioned as well as the precision and science
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   because of the nice high gross margins that those businesses have
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   and you know lower on the specialty vehicles
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   and the industrial technologies they tend to play
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   in that kind of 40% range
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   you know you've seen that we have taken very decisive actions
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   between synergies and the short term actions
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   to protect the margin
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   we saw as you mentioned you know some very good first quarter results
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   for the total business under 30%
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and Q2 will clearly see a bit more pressure from a top line perspective
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   but we will continue to manage decrementals
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   with the target being closer to that 30%
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   of the EBITDA
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and you know when you think about the actions
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   we're clearly taking much more aggressive actions
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   and high pressure around cost actions
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   based on what we see here with a lot of our data points
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   and the long duration of the downturn
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   that we expect that business to have
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Very helpful to send this stay well
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Thank you Yidwani
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Your line is open
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Hi good morning
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Good morning Julian
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Morning maybe just a first question on that point
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   on decremental margins
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   so if you could help us understand perhaps
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   the phasing of the cost synergies through the year
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and also of that 40 to 50 million of other cost out actions
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   and should those mean that decremental margins narrow
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   or not necessarily depending on your mix and some other things
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   He maybe break it down into the two buckets
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   as you suggested I mean the 40 to 50
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   that we spoke about
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   that are kind of more related to discretionary
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   or kind of volume related
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   those are largely second quarter and third quarter
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   with a good majority I would say more so
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   on the second quarter
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   from the cost synergy perspective
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   million dollars out of 80 to 90 million dollars of in year
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   you know rough account
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   and I'll say that is kind of consistent
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   third quarter and fourth quarter
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   while the other roughly 10 to 20 million dollars
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   that comes from procurement
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   it is really more weighted towards that kind of Q3 and Q4
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   and then maybe just my second question for you
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   or for Emily around the free cash flow
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   you had a good performance in Q1
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   just wondered you know you had your assumptions
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   around break even free cash
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   but assume you didn't play out
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   you know what kind of sales are down
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   call it 20, 25% for the year
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   what type of free cash flow conversion
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   should we expect
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   how do you see the working capital moving
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   you had I think in the free cash
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   63 million dollars of transaction and separation
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   cash cost in Q1
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   what's the rough assumption for the year
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   yes we're very pleased with the Q1 cash performance
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   as you saw there Julian
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   and we've been managing cash
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   you know from
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   to put in good processes
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and strong controls around it
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   given the current crisis
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   we expect cash to still be
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   to move forward but certainly a longer
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   cash cycle as we move through
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and we're really managing
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   you know payments as
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   the collections we're receiving
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   to maintain our strong cash flow
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   and liquidity positions
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   you know what the future holds
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   a lot of that's you know going to depend on
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   for sure but we know
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   we'll maintain our cash position and our liquidity
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   and how about the costs
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   any very rough guide
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I'd posed for the year
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   in light of that 63 million in Q1
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   will be some incremental cash
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   I don't have the figure
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   at my fingertips at the moment Julian
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   but I can get back to you on that
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   your next question comes from Michael Holleran
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   from Baird
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   morning everyone hope everyone's doing well
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   so could we just talk about
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   the synergy funnel you referenced
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   what are some of the incremental sources
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   that you originally identified
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   maybe talk about the difference you're seeing
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   you know longer term some of the revenue
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   synergy opportunities you see
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   as you recall you know we always said
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   that we were going for
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   you know we were 60 days into
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   the transaction we have all these
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   visibility as to what that funnel could
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   potentially be
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   roughly the hundred million dollars
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   comes from a combination of structural savings
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   rationalization kind of non manufacturing
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   alluded to on the investors
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   we have now a pretty good database
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   of all the locations across the world
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   and that is giving us a very good way
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   to really understand and rationalize
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   not so much the amount
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   coming year two year three
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   but more the other kind of perspective
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   so second part of the question
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   liquidity is in a strong position
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   some of the one off things
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   operation and some of the extra things
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   I'm only just referenced
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   what would it take for you guys
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   to be a little bit more aggressive
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   with the cash outflow
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   and then second area related to that
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   that we're going into some sort
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   of recession here who knows how long
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   the opportunity is going to accelerate
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   the play cap more toward the M&A side
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   of things over the next couple years
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   and are you positioned for that today
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   and any kind of thoughts
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   and how you're thinking
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   similarly about that capital side
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   over the next six nine plus months
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   yeah, no absolutely Mike
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   I think clearly over the next couple years
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   continue to be a really hard of our strategy
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   we see it's a very unique environment right now
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   we still see at this point in time
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   some very good funnel
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   also very good funnel around
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   industrial technologies
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   but they're really more relatable buttons
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   thank you
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   your next question comes from Nigel Koh
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   from Wolfe Research
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   your line is open
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   good morning how you guys
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   yeah, good thanks
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   we'll take performance
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   a little bit
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   performance and it seems like most of that
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   came from the legacy IR businesses
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   please maybe just kind of
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   spell out a bit more detail
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   how much of that can be explained
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   by the jokes of the industrial
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   of the IR
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   also what happens in service during the quarter
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Nigel what happens
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   yeah, what happens is
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   I would say this
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   I think China was definitely impacted largely
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   in January and February
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   the legacy IR business
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   they have a pretty sizable China exposure
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   you know in terms of
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   the service
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   we saw service better
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   typically we saw roughly about two times
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   from a percentage perspective
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   better performance than the original equipment
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   and just to kind of give you maybe
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   a little bit more color here
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   particularly as you know
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   ways of comparing some of the
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   industrial technology is composed
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   of multiple technologies
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   compressors, vacuums and blowers
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   and our compressive business is clearly within the
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   when we specifically compare to some other
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   compared to the first couple of data points
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   that we look at so the third party report
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   at the same time you know just to give you
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   a further perspective
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   the legacy Gardner Denver business in Q1
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   orders were down in the low single
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   so in the market and you know
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   since we didn't own the legacy IR
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   for the full quarter
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   we just tend to not comment on what we saw
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   specifically in January and February
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   that they saw from an order perspective
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   but that hopefully gives you a good perspective
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   as to how even on the legacy you think
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   great thanks
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   this business
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   this business has become so small now
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   there's so much involvement
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   but if it is down a percent in the quarter
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   that implies you know that
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   I mean is it possible to break
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   given that you're pretty expecting this
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   business to be kind of like
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   weaker for longer
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   you know would you expect revenue to kind of like
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   just bounce along the truck here
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   for the next several quarters I mean any kind of that would be helpful
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   yeah so for sure you know
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   that's what we're targeting to be
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   you know the great even even positive
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   I mean we're taking some pretty pretty aggressive actions
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   100% after marketing consumables
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   so that kind of carries
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   a much better margin profile too as well
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   and you know those factories that are kind of
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   not needed
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   based on volume I mean we're basically
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   keeping them close
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   or very very low
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   exposure so a good playbook on how
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   how to navigate
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   have done extensive work
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   and you know I think we see
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   that we can definitely overcome these kind of long term
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   and our plan is that
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   it's going to be down for a while
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   and to the second question you know
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   I mean clearly it's a market that
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   as you saw we just invested
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   in new fluid and technology so
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   and you know we can be ready for capturing
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   great thank you very much
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   our next question comes from Jeff Sprott
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   from vertical research partners
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   thank you good morning everyone
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   morning Jeff
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   why don't we just come back to service for a moment
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   this is an interesting comment about
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   utilization down
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   30%
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   but how do we actually interpret
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   and apply that to a forward
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   sales are going to be down 30%
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   and the service I don't believe
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   I don't know if you have enough data
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   historically to kind of piece that together
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   but what does that down 30% tell you
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   yeah Jeff great question
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   so in terms of the historical data
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   we don't have a lot of historical because as you know
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   as you can imagine a lot of these
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   remote monitoring systems and connectivity
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   with the IoT platforms that we
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   both companies have now
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   is fairly new
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   but we have enough data to then break it down
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   by the specific
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   sub end market
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   the indication here is that it's telling us
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   where are those markets
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   that we should continue to play
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   or double down from a service perspective
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   so it's helping us to redirect the teams
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   it's also helping us to really better
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   serve our customers and making sure that
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   we're still more resilient from that perspective
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   you know in terms of being down 30%
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I mean I think we just see that as
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   a bit of indication as to what could happen here
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   but as you gave us a great correlation
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   as we don't have a lot of historical data
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   to
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   so what we're doing is just taking that data
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   point to keep focusing them
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   on those areas, regions and markets
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   that we're still seeing some very good
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   utilization of the compressors
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   and any answers
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   you noted ITS obviously includes more than compressors
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   are you suggesting that
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   those other products, areas outside of that
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   teams and blowers were substantial?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Yes, so for sure the PowerTools
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   and the listing business
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   was one that was worse than that
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   I mean the PowerTools
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   they have two main programs
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   I mean it's that tool business
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   but also they have a listing business
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   that is kind of more related to factory consumption
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   or factory rationalization
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   so I think that was impacted more so
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   and then China as a region
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   was definitely heavily impacted
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   and from the other product lines
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   in terms of the longer cycle
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   which these are kind of brands like
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Nash, Garrow, Liquid Green Ponds
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   and Liquid Green Vacuums
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   those are more longer cycle and those were
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   I'll say more stable and resilient
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Right, thank you
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Your next question comes from David Rosso
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   from Evercore ISI
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Your line is open
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Good morning, my question is about
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   in the ITF's inventory in the channel
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   and you think about some of the recent improvement you've seen
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   can you give us some sense
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   on any sequential improvement
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   sort of a lead lag
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   and also the mix of your businesses
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   being short cycle versus long cycle
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   can you just give us some sense of the inventory
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   in those channels
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   the lag you would need to see
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   or that you would experience if say the PMIs got better for example
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   Yeah David, I think when we look at the inventory
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   in those channels
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   I mean there's just not quite this
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   from a compressor perspective
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   which is obviously the one that has
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   the biggest size of the distribution network
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   and it is also more particularly towards
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   the Garner Denver branded products
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   we don't tend to have a lot of inventory
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   because these are
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   particularly smaller distributors
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   more sub regional lines
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   more localized
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   they don't tend to put a lot of cash upfront
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   to have compressors on the shelf
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   so to speak maybe on the smaller compressors they may
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   but not on the medium to high level compressors
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   and the inventory will come in
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   more on consumables after market
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   and really move fairly well
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   they turn fairly quickly
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   You've seen just how clear
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   is it a stabilization at a low level
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   after the initial shock in ITS
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   or have you seen some little improvement
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   in order sequentially
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   sure is is that more short cycle
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   or long cycle?
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Yeah I know, great question
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   it is out categorized as stabilization
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   initially and then obviously
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   when you look at it within the month
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   at the month of April
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   there's some slight improvement
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   on the second half of April
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   But again, was that more short cycle improvement?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Short cycle, yeah
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   Short cycle, alright thank you very much
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Appreciate it
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Your next question comes from Josh
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Pokolinsky
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Hi good morning all
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Good morning Josh
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   So this afternoon I guess everyone here on the call
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   kind of had the same list of questions
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   so we covered a lot of ground already
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   but I guess just with some of the commentary
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   around utilization
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   and with the comments you made around supply chain
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   interruption and how much of the decline
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   you're seeing and
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   I guess this comment is mostly in ITNS comment
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   is related to customer shutdowns
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   or supply chain interruption in some form
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   like the lights come back on
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   and a certain amount of demand comes back
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   because I think to some of these points
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   on service or utilization
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   that maybe that's not the steady
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   state of the world there
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   Yeah Josh, I'll say more so in China
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   if you want to think about it kind of that
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   disruption completely
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   Also in the first quarter
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   maybe some disruption from the perspective
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   of in Europe particularly in Italy
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   I mean we do have some very good manufacturing
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   days in Italy
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   and we although we stayed operationally
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   I mean most of our suppliers
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   had to shut down
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   I would say that now
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   as kind of the comment that I made before
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   we see kind of days lower demand level
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   kind of getting more stabilized
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   but still
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   not seeing that kind of recovery
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   will play out
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Okay and then switching over to the synergy funnel
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   I mean it sounds like the year three
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   pipeline of activity
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   has to stay there as you have to act on other things first
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   since we're manufacturing centric
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   fair to say that the incremental step up
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   in synergy then in the year two is
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   it's smaller I guess
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   is this more of a pull forward from year two
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   or are you kind of implicitly saying
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   hey we think there's more than 250 here
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   we're just, we're working on this as fast as we can
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   and we'll update you as we know more
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   Yeah I think that's exactly the case
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   We think we want to keep it at 250
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   just because we think it's prudent
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   and we think it's prudent because we're
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   I mean clearly focused on a lot of the
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   internal funnel and execution
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   you see how we accelerate it
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   and we execute it
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   I mean this is not just talking about
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   we execute it
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   but there's a component around procurement
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   and an I2V savings
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   innovative value that is born independent
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   and when we did a $250 million cost synergy funnel
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   it was done based on 2019 kind of
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   runway level so to speak of spend levels
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   so we just want to be prudent from
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   kind of going out there and saying that
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   the $250 will increase
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   once we're ready we'll definitely
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   when we see more stability
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   or normalization in the market
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   maybe we come back with that
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   but at this point in time we're accelerating
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   what we can control
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   and we know that we can control that structural head count out
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   and that's exactly what we executed
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   so we're very focused on
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   kind of going through the list of things
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   that we can really execute
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Great, appreciate the call
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   Good luck Ian
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Your next question comes from Nathan Jones
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   from Steeple
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Your line is open
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Good morning everyone
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   See you know revenue down 8.6 to XFX margins
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   up 120 basis points
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   so clearly some very good control lags
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   on what drove the very good decrementals there
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   how you see the decrementals going forward
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   and maybe any color you can give a slide
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   what you think the long term margin opportunity
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   is in that business
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   This is
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   I'll say some very good cost control
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   but also some very good momentum
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   that we had also from the medical business
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   if you remember last year
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   when we talked about the medical business
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   we were seeing upwards of 200 basis points
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   margin improvement
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   and the medical business finishing last year
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   at roughly 30-31% EBITDA margin
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   so again very good momentum from that business
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   and clearly as we saw some softening in the market
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   the team continued to execute those
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   targets that they needed to get done
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   you know I think when you look at this business
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   that has some very nice gross margins
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   and you know the decrementals
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   the basic decrementals are typically 45 or so
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   I mean pretty good job that the team did here
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   in order to get the decrementals down to the 15%
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   and I'll say you know from a long-term perspective
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   we'll definitely come back
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   with giving some kind of medium to long-term perspective
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   I'll just do a quick comparison
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   and you can see that medical we were able to
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   you know not only just a few years ago
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   the medical business was in the 25-26% EBITDA margin
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   and we finished you know last year
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   in the 31% EBITDA margin
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   and there's just a lot of good coming out
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   in between the medical and the legacy
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   you know PFS and ARO business
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   that are within this segment
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   okay maybe just one on receivables
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   when you look through that
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   do you see any customer credit risk
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   any collection risk there
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   I guess it's particularly an upstream comment
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   given the way that market's going
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   but anywhere else you see
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   any potential issues in receivables
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   how you're going about managing customer credit
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   those kinds of things
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   I'll say not necessarily Nathan
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   I mean I think it's one that we
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   we live by day by day
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   I mean clearly the
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   on the high pressure solution
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   which is as you mentioned the most exposed
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   I mean customers are still paying
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   they take longer to pay but they still pay
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   you know they also realize that
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   you know from an upstream perspective
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   that our business is critical and essential
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   for when the market comes back up again
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   so we are being pretty strict in many cases
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   that we need to see the payment
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   or we will stop shipment
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   and then we cease to provide
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   any type of
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   output of products
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   either now or later in the future
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   so I think we're
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   really executing a good label here
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   on collections with the teams
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   excellent thank you
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   thank you
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   your next question comes from Nicole
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   DeBlaze from Deutsche Bank
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   your line is open
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   yeah thanks good morning guys
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   morning Nicole
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   so a lot of this has been answered
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   we've covered a lot of ground so far
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   but I just wanted to ask one
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   into next year as we think about
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   you know approaching or recovery
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   we've got you know more structural cost savings
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   coming through presumably
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   you have temporary cost
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   probably coming back to the business
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   and then just kind of deltailing
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   all of that with typical incremental margins
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   I'm not sure you know how best
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   you can do this this Sunday but it would be really
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   you know helpful to kind of characterize
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   the way you see incrementals
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   coming out you know on the other side
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   of this downturn
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   yeah Nicole yeah that's great
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   I mean I think you know we typically see
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   kind of the base what I call the base level
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   of incremental to be
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   you know for the total business
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   between 35 to 40 percent
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   again you know when you look at
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   precision and science maybe higher than that
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   specialty vehicles
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   lower than that
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   with maybe industrial technologies about that level
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   you know definitely
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   we'll see a little bit of a headwind
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   as we see a lot of these
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   structural activities that we're going
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   to come to the provision
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   we also see
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   a lot of you know tailwinds
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   I'm sorry we see tailwinds
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   a lot of these kind of structural cost come out
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   we see some of some of the headwinds
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   but you know as we kind of
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   get closer to
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   coming out here to our budgets
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   and how we kind of work with the teams
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   we'll definitely find ways on how we
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   can continue to get that
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   incremental margin obviously
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   to be at a minimum of that
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   days or more
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   your next question comes from John Walsh
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   from Credit Suisse your line is open
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   sorry your next question
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   is from Markus Nittenmayer
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   from UBS your line is open
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   yeah hi good morning everybody
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   just one more on the
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   hi good morning
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   on synergies I do appreciate
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   that obviously procurement is
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   volume dependent but
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   you flag here 10 to 20 million
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   savings realized in 2020
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   what do you currently
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   assume a sort of full run rate savings
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   out of that weight one of the spend
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   which I think is a third of your overall spend
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   and how should we think about more
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   medium-term for the other two thirds
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   if you assume that a company
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   in a normalised third gets back to about
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   2019 levels let's start here
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   yeah I think if you think about it
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   10 to 20 coming in
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   in this year
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   as you go into 2021 assuming
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   maybe kind of current volume levels
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   it'll be 20 to 40 million
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   so that's maybe at least
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   that's what you can see here coming
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   from wave 1 on an
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   analysed level at current volumes
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   and that only sees only covering
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   a portion of the total spend
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   with weight 2 and weight 3
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   coming up here in the second half of the year
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   right and is there
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   sort of an estimate you can give us
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   what that would have been at 19 volume
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   levels that's sort of not 20 to 40
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   I mean it will definitely be a little
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   higher than that I mean
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   I wouldn't
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   you know I think
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   at this point in time you could say
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   40 to 50 could be upwards of 16
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   okay and then
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   second question on capital allocation
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   you flagged in the slides what's interesting
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   those bolt downs in PST
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   it's obviously pretty fragmented
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   market you probably have a share of
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   15% in that space
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   how do you think about this how does
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   that segment look like in a few years
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   from an aftermarket perspective
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   I know it's a design win and replacement
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   business so the aftermarket dollars
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   per se or share is relatively small
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   compared to your company average
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   but how do you think about this
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   it just struck me that it was flagged
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   specifically in the slides
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   I think this is a segment we like a lot
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   by the way that
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   these businesses are kind of so
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   niche and very
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   solid market positions
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   and it has just a lot
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   of great descriptors
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   such as high gross margins
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   and very specialized
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   bumps that
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   are kind of really solidly mission critical
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   in the processes
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   where they apply
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   we continue to see
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   that there's a lot of potential
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   not only in organic but also organically
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   and we're doing a lot of work on that
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   whether you take technologies like
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   the ARO
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   and combine that with
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   either a Haskell branded product
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   or a Milton Roy product
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   and then you can actually create some uniqueness
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   in terms of applications
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   and then enter some new markets
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   and that's what a lot of the team are doing
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   is how do we
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   are being thoughtful and mindful
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   on some of those vertical markets
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   and kind of new niche adjacent
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   areas that we want to play in
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   and not only do that organically
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   but then see what other technologies
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   from a Bolton perspective we can acquire
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   so a lot of
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   really great work strategically going on
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   in this segment to really
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   picture this and how do we
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   kind of double it
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   Thanks a lot. Good luck.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Thank you.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Your next question comes from John Walsh
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   from Credit Suisse.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Your line is open.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   Good morning. Sorry about that.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   Had some technical difficulties earlier.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   I'm glad to hear everyone's doing well.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   Maybe just
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   one question here.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   You alluded on the call to
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   share gains on kind of both
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   the legacy GDI and IR
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   businesses.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   I wanted to know if you could put a little more color
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   around what's driving those is it
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   something on the product
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   side is it some of the
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   market strategies you were doing previously
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   around
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   more niche markets like paper
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   and pulp
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   maybe some competitive pressures
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   from smaller guys
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   just any kind of color you could provide there
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   would be helpful.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   Sure John, I'm not categorizing.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   What I said on the call is that it is
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   on specific horsepower
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   and what we saw that we liked
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   is that this is in the U.S. based on the
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   third party report
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   and we liked because it was very
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   commentary. So if you look at the legacy
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Garnet Denver we saw some share takes
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   in the low to medium horsepower
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   while we saw on the Ingersoll run
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   some share take on the high
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   kind of larger horsepower compressors
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   I will categorize that as
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   Ingersoll run has done a pretty good job on launching some
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   new technology on the larger horsepower
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   while as you know
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   from a Garnet Denver perspective we have been
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   more focused on the medium to small
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   compressor and I think
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   this is what I mentioned on the call
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   that this is a great hypothesis that we had
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   on this great merge
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   and combining the two companies because now
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   we have great new complementary
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   products and spectrum of technologies
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   that
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   you know a lot of these that I mentioned is on the
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   oil lubricated
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   which is very good solid
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   kind of core product line but as we spoke
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   about during the April call
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   now also the oil free
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   product line spectrum. So again
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   it's new technology
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   new products and be able
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   to show the uniqueness
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   of differentiation on the product that the teams are launching.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   Great appreciate taking
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   the question. Thank you John.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   There are no further questions at this time I
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   turned the call back over to the company.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   Thank you I just want to close
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   out by saying thanks to everyone
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   for your interest in
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Ingersoll run I want to do another
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   shootout and thank you to our employees
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   who are obviously doing a lot of work here
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   to stay health
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   stay safe to safety
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   and at the same time
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   you know provide to our customers the mission critical
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   pros that are needed
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   in this kind of current market condition.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   So hopefully everyone stays safe
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   and healthy and we'll look
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   forward to talking to you over the next few weeks.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   Thank you.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   Ladies and gentlemen this concludes
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   today's conference call. Thank you for participating.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Constellion's second quarter
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000]   2020 results call.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.480]   At this time, all participants are in the least and only mode.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.200]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   time.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.480]   If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.320]   touchstone telephone.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.920]   As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.640]   I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Ryan Ventling, Director
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640]   of Investor Relations.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640]   Sir, please go ahead.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640]   Thank you, Operator.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.000]   I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2020 earnings call.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.640]   On the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Jean-Marc Germain and our Chief Financial Officer,
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   Peter Math.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.120]   After the presentation, we will have a Q&A session.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.880]   A copy of the slide presentation for today's call is available on our website at constellion.com
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.640]   and today's call is being recorded.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.680]   Before we begin, I would like to encourage everyone to visit the company's website and take a look
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080]   at our recent filings.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.880]   Today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.720]   litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.560]   Such statements include statements regarding the company's anticipated financial and operating
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.120]   performance, future events and expectations and may involve known and unknown risks and
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120]   uncertainties.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.880]   For a summary of specific risk factors that could cause results differ materially from
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.660]   those expressed in the forward-looking statement, please refer to the factors presented under
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.440]   the heading Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 20F.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.120]   All information in this presentation is as of the date of the presentation.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.280]   We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.080]   of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by law.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.000]   In addition, today's presentation includes information regarding certain non-gap financial
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   measures.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.800]   Please see the reconciliations of non-gap financial measures attached in today's slide presentation
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.640]   would supplement our IFRS disclosures.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.360]   I would now like to hand the call over to Jean-Marc.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   Thanks Ryan.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.080]   Good morning, good afternoon everyone and thank you for your interest in Constellion.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.440]   Let's turn to slide 5.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.920]   At Constellion, the health and safety of our employees is our first priority.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.000]   We have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.140]   We have provided our personnel with personal protective equipment, increased cleaning and
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.960]   sanitation, allowed for and enforced social distancing and worked to raise awareness with
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.760]   our employees.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.280]   I want to personally thank our employees for taking this seriously and following the precautions
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.480]   we have put into place.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.280]   As of last Friday, approximately one-half of one percent of our employees have tested positive
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   for COVID-19 and all of them have recovered or are recovering.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.920]   Needless to say, we must remain vigilant.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.360]   During the second quarter, our plans operated well despite the significant disruptions to
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.200]   customer demand from lockdowns in both Europe and the U.S.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.320]   As I am speaking, all our plans are running now and well.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.720]   We are carefully monitoring COVID-19 hotspots, both for the health of our employees and
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.600]   any potential impacts on supply chains.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.680]   The demand for our products gradually increased during the course of the second quarter and
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.560]   this trend has continued into July.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.080]   However, both levels of demand and visibility from our customers remain below historical
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.400]   levels.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.200]   We took strong actions to combat the effects of the pandemic on our business.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.880]   We aggressively reduced our costs, including flexing variable costs to match production
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.640]   levels, reducing fixed costs and lowering our targeted capital expenditures.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.280]   Over 40 percent of our workforce were on subtype of partial unemployment or temporary lay of
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.120]   scheme during the quarter, where appropriate, we have also implemented permanent headcount
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.880]   reduction.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.560]   Our ability to flex costs was slightly better than the scenario we provided last quarter.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.040]   This was a great achievement by the entire Considium team and demonstrated our flexibility and
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   resilience.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.560]   Our liquidity at the end of the quarter was 949 million euros, an increase of over 300
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.840]   million euros compared to the end of the first quarter.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.560]   We added an additional 50 million euros of liquidity in July through credit facilities
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.080]   supported by the German state, bringing our pro forma liquidity to approximately one billion
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080]   euros.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.920]   In June, we accessed the debt markets to refinance our 2021 bonds.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.320]   This transaction removed our unlinear term bond maturity at the very attractive coupon.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.720]   In conclusion, with the significant actions we have taken, I am very confident in our ability
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.760]   to navigate through this crisis.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.400]   On slide 6, you will see some of our highlights from the second quarter of 2020.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.960]   Shipments were 310,000 metric tons, a decrease of 25 percent compared to the second quarter
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.520]   of 2019.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.720]   Revenue decreased 33 percent to 1 billion euros.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.800]   Of the roughly 500 million euro decline in revenue compared to the second quarter of last
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:51.800]   year, two-thirds was related to lower shipments and one-third was related to lower metal prices.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.920]   I remind you that while our revenues are affected by changes in metal prices, we operate a
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.600]   pass-through business model to minimize metal risk.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.400]   Net loss of 32 million euros compared to net income of 17 million euros in the second
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.500]   quarter of 2019.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.520]   Adjusted EBITDA of 81 million euros decreased 51 percent compared to the second quarter
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   of 2019.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.160]   With a strong focus on cost control, we are able to offset a significant part of the volume
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.280]   EDWIN to adjust EBITDA across each of our business units.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.560]   I am proud of what the team was able to achieve in a challenging environment.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.000]   Costadium generated 228 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first half, a decline of 24 percent
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.200]   compared to the first six months of last year.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.800]   Our free cash flow was negative 33 million euros in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.520]   This result would not have been possible without our strong actions to reduce costs and capital
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.000]   expenditures and cash expenditures of all sorts.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.400]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was 54 million euros.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.600]   Based on our current view of market conditions, we expect to generate positive free cash flow
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   in 2020.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.280]   I will now hand over to Peter to discuss our financial performance in more detail.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   Peter?
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.480]   Thank you Jean-Marc and thank you everyone for joining the call today.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.680]   Turning now to slide 8, you will find the change in adjusted EBITDA by segment for the second
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   quarter and the first half of 2020 compared to the same periods of last year.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.560]   For the second quarter of 2020, Costadium achieved 81 million euros of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.760]   of 86 million euros or 51 percent year over year.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:54.840]   First adjusted EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased by 21 million euros or 27 percent
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.640]   compared to last year.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:05.240]   ANT adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased by 33 million euros or 51 percent compared
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.160]   to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:15.240]   AS&I adjusted EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31 million euros compared
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.640]   to last year.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:23.480]   Lastly, holdings and corporate costs of 7 million euros were 1 million euros higher than last
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.040]   year.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:32.760]   In the first 6 months of 2020, Costadium achieved 228 million euros of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.840]   of 74 million euros or 24 percent year over year.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:45.400]   Part adjusted EBITDA of 124 million euros decreased by 14 million euros or 11 percent compared
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.360]   to last year.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:56.560]   ANT adjusted EBITDA of 83 million euros decreased by 33 million euros or 28 percent compared to
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.600]   the first 6 months of 2019.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:08.360]   AS&I adjusted EBITDA of 33 million euros decreased by 26 million euros or 44 percent compared to
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.120]   last year.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:16.400]   Lastly, holdings and corporate costs of 12 million euros were 1 million euros higher than last
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   year.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:23.680]   We expect ANT costs of approximately 20 million euros in 2020.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.200]   Now turn to slide 9 and let's focus on the part segment.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.360]   Adjusted EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased 27 percent compared to the second quarter
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   of last year.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.960]   Item was a headwind of 41 million euros in the quarter.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:48.400]   Packaging shipments fell by 12 percent, primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in March
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.360]   of our Newspersack plant in France due to COVID-19.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:59.600]   Shipments to the North American can cheat market increased slightly year over year.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.440]   Automotive shipments declined 54 percent compared to last year as many of our automotive OEM
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.800]   owners curtailed production for April and most of May.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.040]   Price and mix was a headwind of 2 million euros.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.600]   Costs were a tailwind of 21 million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.320]   labor and maintenance as important contributors.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.840]   Metal costs were neutral in the quarter as we faced difficult year over year comps, UBC
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.520]   supply chain challenges and lower metal prices.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   FX translation was a tailwind of 1 million euros.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.740]   Now turn to slide 10 and let's focus on the A&T segment.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:53.240]   Adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased by 51 percent compared to last year.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:11:01.760]   Volume was a headwind of 46 million euros on lower aerospace and TID shipments.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.920]   Aerospace shipments fell 37 percent compared to last year as aerospace OEM and distributors
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.880]   began to reduce orders.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:18.280]   TID shipments declined by 20 percent due to lower industrial activity in both Europe and
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.400]   the U.S.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.920]   Price and mix was a 3 million euro headwind due to lower aerospace shipments.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:33.940]   Costs were a tailwind of 15 million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.920]   labor, metal and maintenance as important contributors.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:46.160]   Lastly, FX translation was a 1 million euro tailwind in the quarter.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.640]   Now turn to slide 11 and let's focus on the A&I segment.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.320]   Adjusted EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31 million euros compared to
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.640]   the 2nd quarter of 2019.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.000]   Volume was a 31 million euro headwind.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.920]   Automotive shipments declined 52 percent compared to last year due to customer shutdowns for a
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.120]   significant portion of the quarter.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.360]   Industry shipments declined 16 percent due to lower industrial activity in Europe.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:26.000]   Price and mix was a 9 million euro headwind partially due to price and mix as a consequence
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.120]   of weaker market conditions.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:37.460]   Costs were a 9 million euro tailwind on strong cost control with labor, energy and fixed cost
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.360]   as important contributors.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:45.840]   Lastly, FX translation was a 1 million euro headwind in the quarter.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.600]   Now turning to slide 12, I want to highlight our very strong cost performance during the
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.320]   2nd quarter.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.520]   In the 2nd quarter, we managed to flex our cost by 83 percent.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.960]   Cost flex represents the change of cost over the change of revenue for the 2nd quarter
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.160]   of 2020 compared to the 2nd quarter of 2019.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:16.440]   Effectively, for every dollar change in revenue, we were able to flex our cost by 83 cents.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:23.200]   This compares favorably to the 75 percent variable cost estimate we provided last quarter.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.320]   At the bottom of the page, you can see that each of our businesses demonstrated strong
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:37.360]   cost control with PARC at 92 percent cost flex and ANT and AS&I at 75 percent.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.180]   To put this in context, excluding metal and depreciation, we reduced cost by approximately
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.740]   100 million euros compared to the 2nd quarter of last year.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:56.520]   These cost savings were driven by strong cost control across the businesses including labor,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.120]   maintenance, professional fees, subcontractors and energy.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:08.300]   I will note that our 2nd quarter 2020 figures include approximately a 15 million euro benefit
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:14.440]   from European state employment aid related to COVID-19.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.520]   I want to congratulate the team for the aggressive actions taken on cost.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.540]   We will continue to maintain our strong focus on cost control, particularly given the uncertain
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.040]   demand environment.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   Now let's turn to slide 13 and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:40.920]   At the end of the 2nd quarter, our leverage was 4.4 times and our net debt was 2.2 billion
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.440]   euros, slightly lower than our net debt position at the end of 2019.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.960]   We remain very committed to capital discipline.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:58.340]   We reduced our 2020 CAPEX target to approximately 175 million euros, a 96 million euro reduction
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.340]   from 2019.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:06.760]   Through the first half of 2020, we spent 32 million euros less in CAPEX than in the same
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.260]   period of last year.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.840]   Our free cash flow for the 2nd quarter was -33 million euros.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.280]   During the quarter, as a consequence of lower activity, our factored receivables were lower
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.200]   than the levels that we have maintained in recent quarters and negatively impacted our
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.280]   free cash flow by 73 million euros.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.760]   We would expect the reverse to occur as activity levels increase.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:40.320]   Excluding the impact of factoring, the company actually generated positive free cash flow
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.900]   in the 2nd quarter, which is a very impressive outcome, in my view.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:52.360]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was 54 million euros.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:58.240]   As John Mark noted earlier, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 based on our
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.200]   current view of market conditions.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.800]   Generating free cash flow is a firm priority and we remain committed to deleveraging.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.320]   As you can see in our debt summary on the bottom left hand side of the page, we have no bond
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.800]   maturities until 2024.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:22.600]   During the quarter, we refinanced the remaining 200 million of our 4 and 5/8 percent notes
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:33.360]   due 2021 with $325 million of 5 and 5/8 percent notes due 2028.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.720]   While we initially planned to repay the 21s with free cash flow, we felt it was prudent
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.000]   to remove this near-term maturity given the favorable debt market conditions.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.960]   Notably, this was the lowest coupon dollar bond that Constellium has ever priced, a considerable
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.880]   achievement in the midst of a pandemic.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.660]   As a result of our financing activities thus far in 2020, we now expect cash interest of
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.640]   150 to 160 million euros.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:12.320]   Our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was 949 million euros at the end
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.900]   of the second quarter.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:20.840]   As John Mark noted, we added 50 million euros to this balance in July and we remain very comfortable
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.800]   in our liquidity position.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.360]   I will now hand the call back to John Mark.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   Thank you Peter.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:33.860]   Let's turn to site 15. I want to highlight something that is core to our business, sustainability.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:40.080]   In early July, we published our 2019 Business and Sustainability Report, which you can find
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.080]   on our website.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.040]   I'd like to point out a few highlights from 2019.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.120]   Safety is our first priority.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.920]   Our target is to reduce our recordable case rates by 10 percent year after year.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:01.680]   Between 2016 and 2019, our recordable case rate decreased by 27 percent and we are trending
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.720]   very well this year.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.760]   This means that more of our colleagues are returning home injury free every day.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:17.240]   We also improved our energy efficiency by 6.4 percent compared to a 2015 baseline.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:24.400]   That is the equivalent of 100,000 metric tons of CO2 savings every year.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.880]   Further, we introduced the 2025 target to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 25 percent
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:40.240]   against the 2015 baseline and we have a detailed plan to achieve this target.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.720]   As many of you know, recycling is a core competency at Constellium.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:53.600]   Aluminum is infinitely recyclable, with 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced still in use today.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.120]   Muscle Shoals is one of the largest recyclers of aluminum cans globally, with the capacity
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.720]   to recycle over 20 billion cans every year.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:10.560]   At North Presac, we also recycle the equivalent of 12 billion beverage cans every year.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:18.680]   As a company, Constellium recycled over 560,000 metric tons of externally sourced aluminum
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.780]   scrap in 2019.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:28.160]   I am also proud that third parties are recognizing Constellium for our sustainability achievements.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:34.880]   The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, or ASI, is an industry led initiative to drive sustainability
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.560]   across the entire aluminum value chain, from producers to customers.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:48.200]   In 2019, we received ASI certifications for Zingen's casting and rolling operations and
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:55.000]   we began producing ASI certified coils for our customers from Zingen in 2020.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   We also received ASI certification of our North Presac facility under provisional COVID
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.040]   conditions in 2020.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:11.080]   We achieved the Ecovirus Platinum rating, which is awarded to the top 1 percent of companies
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   assessed worldwide, and we received an ESG rating of AA from MSCI, placing us in the top 5 percent
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.840]   of our sector.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   Overall, we had a very successful year on our sustainability objectives in 2019 and I look
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:34.280]   forward to continuing our progress on these very important initiatives.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.800]   Now let's turn to slide 16 and discuss our end markets.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.920]   We believe our balanced portfolio of products across end markets, geographies and customers
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.680]   is a competitive advantage during challenging times like these.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.360]   I'll start with the packaging market.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:58.600]   packaging is a core market for Constellation and we presented 38 percent of our LTM revenue.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:06.040]   We continue to see strong demand in North America and stable demand in Europe, further evidence
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:11.920]   that this market is both recession resilient and secular growth.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.840]   We believe the packaging market has long-term secular growth tailwinds driven by customer
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.440]   preference for aluminum cans.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.760]   Our customers continue to invest in new can lines with several additional investments in North
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.160]   America just announced in the last week.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:35.560]   These additional lines should drive incremental demand for canned sheets in the years to come.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:41.400]   The consumer preference trend is only one of tailwinds for canned sheets.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:47.000]   In Europe, the demand for canned sheets continues to grow based on substitution of aluminum for
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   steel.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.720]   In the US, we continue to expect the growth of auto body sheet demand to tighten supply
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:00.520]   to the packaging market over the medium to long-term.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.960]   Now let's move to automotive.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.280]   Over the long-term, automotive remains a secular growth market for aluminum.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.760]   Customers continue to prefer larger vehicles.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.440]   With regulations aimed at increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions, the automotive
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.960]   market will need to continue to lightweight.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.640]   In addition, we expect hybrid and electric vehicles to continue to gain share of the feet.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.680]   These vehicles are aluminum intensive due to the importance of lightweighting to achieve
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.080]   their range objectives.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.840]   Constellium is well positioned to realize the benefits of this secular shift to aluminum
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.080]   in automotive and the electrification of the feet.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.880]   According to more recent trends, automotive OEMs began sculpting production in March and
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.560]   largely resumed production in May.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:59.120]   While demand from our customers increased significantly in June, we have experienced uneven demand
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:05.960]   for our products as a result of supply chain challenges and COVID-19 hotspots.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:11.560]   While we are optimistic about automotive demand in the back half of 2020, the demand for our
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.240]   products will be dependent on the level of production at the OEM.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.080]   Let's turn now to aerospace.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.640]   Aerospace represented 15% of our LTM revenues.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:30.400]   The near-term outlook for aerospace remains uncertain due to the effects from COVID-19
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.320]   and the 737 MAX.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:39.560]   Aerospace OEMs have reduced build rates and it is unclear how long build rates will remain
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.440]   at these levels.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.880]   To expect aerospace shipments in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 will be lower than the
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.800]   level in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:56.760]   In TID, we expect to continue to expand in each product in a diversified range of markets
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.480]   over the long term.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:05.000]   In the near-term, the defense and rail markets remain strong, but most industrial and transportation
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.400]   markets remain weak.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.800]   These markets are dependent upon the health of the industrial economy in Europe and North
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   America.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.000]   It is unclear when and to what extent these markets will rebound.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.960]   In closing, I again want to thank the Constellium team for their tireless efforts during this
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.960]   trying time.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:32.880]   We remain committed to operational execution, harvesting the benefits of our investments,
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.560]   in capital deployment, debt reduction and shareholder value creation.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.080]   With that Joanna, we will now open the Q&A session.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.720]   Thank you sir.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press part and the number
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.800]   one on your touchtone telephone.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.640]   If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:04.360]   press the pound key.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.680]   Your first question comes from the line of Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.720]   Your line is open.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   Chris, if you are on mute, please unmute.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.440]   Chris, your line is not open.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.440]   How's your mark, Peter?
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.440]   Can you hear me?
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.440]   Yeah, we can.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440]   Good morning Chris.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.760]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:48.760]   The first thing I wanted to start with was just the utilisation rates and the comments from
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.760]   one queue.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:55.560]   You sort of stepped through how you saw utilisation in each of the divisions for two queue and
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.440]   then perhaps for three queue and four queue.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.280]   I appreciate you don't have guidance, but I wondered whether you could maybe conceptually
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:08.240]   talk through three queue versus four queue and just versus two queue or any comments you
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.640]   could make on the divisions as an update from last quarter.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   Thanks.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   Sure Chris.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.560]   So I'll start with the markets and then kind of translate it into what it can mean for
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.320]   the divisions, right, for the business unit.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.200]   So when you look at our second quarter of this year versus the second quarter of last
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:36.160]   year, right, you see packaging roughly 10% down, you see automotive 50% down, you see aerospace
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:42.080]   40% down, right, roughly, and the other markets and each market is about 25% down.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.840]   This is made of very different dynamics, right?
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:50.880]   So in packaging what we are seeing now is 95% utilisation.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.880]   There was a bit of a drop, especially in April with all the lockdowns in Europe reduction
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.680]   in canned consumption and all that, but that has come back pretty strong and the U.S. continues
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.480]   to be quite strong.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:10.880]   So we look at packaging again recession resilient, secular growth and we're pretty confident
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.600]   for the second half of the year and we look at Q2 as being kind of an abnormal quarter
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.600]   because of all that happened in April and a little bit in May.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   If I look at automotive, it has really snapped back.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.800]   I think when we talked on Q1, we're talking of 20% utilisation as we were speaking and
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.880]   now we're above 80%, right, and if you do the average of 20 and 80, you get to 50 which
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:43.160]   is about what we experienced in the second half in terms of reduction in their shipments.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:51.600]   It seems like it can be stronger than 80% going forward.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.400]   We still are running very well in July, but we've seen that this restart has been with
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.760]   all kinds of fits and stops, right?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:05.240]   So you've got hotspots, you've got supply chain disruptions, you've got difficulties in bringing
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.920]   products from Mexico, building trucks in Texas is challenging.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.400]   So you've got all those operational issues that all of us in the supply chain have to
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:23.560]   deal with, but clearly the demand seems to be well in excess of 80% of where we were last
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.560]   year.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:30.320]   So that's encouraging and hopefully COVID-19 doesn't throw too much of a wrench in that
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   good trend.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:38.960]   If I look now at aerospace where we were running at around 60% in the quarter, we expect more
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.620]   pain in the second half of the year.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:50.020]   And I think the reason for that is it's a long supply chain and the customers move a little
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:57.440]   bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their orders and that is creating a bit of a lag
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.240]   in terms of how much pain we take.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:06.320]   We are in very detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:12.000]   to look at what the second half ought to look like and why contractually we could force some
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.800]   volumes on us, that's not our type, what they don't need, we don't want to force on them.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:23.760]   So what we're working through is taking more pain now in the second half so that in 2021
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.560]   we start with a clean slate.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:32.240]   So we would expect some reduction in operating rates in aerospace in the second half of the
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   year.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.920]   So if you translate all that into what it means for the different BU's, I would expect
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.760]   BAP, packaging and automotive, to be better.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:50.520]   I would expect AS&I, automotive structures essentially, to be better in the second half
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   and I would expect the NT to be more challenged in the second half.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:08.240]   Thanks so much and sorry … Just sort of follow up on packaging specifically where the volumes
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:14.320]   are down around about 10% I think year on year and you're saying muscle shoulders is doing
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.200]   well, it seems like the US is going well.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   I think Crow and yesterday mentioned that Southern Europe was weak, can you just comment a little
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.760]   bit further about packaging in the EU region?
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:31.120]   Was it down in the quarter because of demand or because you had facilities offline and
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.440]   maybe you could quantify some of the EU impacts?
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:41.760]   Yeah, I think so the reason I'm saying more than 90% or 95% whatever, not 100% is exactly
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:51.280]   because of some weakness in Europe and I think it's got to do with the reduction in activity
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   in Southern Europe.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:58.680]   A lot of these countries have economies that are based on tourism and this is not the best
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:04.960]   year for tourism as we all know and we are seeing there's little clusters and hotspots
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:11.680]   so everybody is vigilant as it should be so that is weighing down a little bit on canned
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.240]   consumption in Europe.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:29.120]   Okay and just sorry I want to follow up on working capital specifically, I just wanted
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:35.440]   maybe Peter if you could talk through the two cue moving parts, obviously you stepped through
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.120]   those waterfall charts and you're getting cost out doing a great job on the cost side.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:46.160]   I just wanted if you come in a little bit further on the second half of the year and what the
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:52.600]   opportunities are on working capital in terms of you saying positive for the full year,
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:57.440]   you've already obviously hit the positive number at the halfway point so just wanted
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.800]   if you could talk through the moving parts on working capital.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:06.360]   Sure, happy to do it and just for context so on the second quarter as we said last quarter
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:15.000]   we would use working capital and we in fact burned 63 million working capital in the NQ2
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.480]   and for the first half we're positive 24 so based on where we sit today I think it's plausible
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:30.520]   to think that with auto ramping, with packaging kind of continuing to ramp back up that we
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:36.080]   could lose some ground in the back half of the year so not a huge negative but we could
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.880]   see working capital being a use in the back half of the year.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:47.760]   But Chris I would say that we remain confident in spite of that that we can achieve a free
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:53.280]   cash flow position.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.280]   Thanks Peter.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.280]   That's it for me.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:07.600]   Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the benchmark company, your
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   line is open.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.600]   Good morning.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   Good morning Josh.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:16.280]   Just a question, how are you thinking any tariffs on Canadian aluminum have you increased any
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.200]   inventory expecting that or just what should we be thinking on that front if that comes
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   to fruition?
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:30.160]   Yeah, well I mean we believe it's misguided measure if it happens right, we blobbed against
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:36.120]   it in the past, we got it removed, it may come back, we think it's misguided and it doesn't
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.880]   address the problem which is over capacity from China from a non-market economy that
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.320]   doesn't play by the same rules as we do.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:50.520]   Now that said if it happens it's got a very limited impact on us or remind you that we
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:58.400]   pass through the melt cost essentially to most of our customers there may be a little section
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.240]   of the business where we cannot reprice immediately when it happens but on the other side we may
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.640]   gain a little bit more on scrap recycling as well so not much of an impact for us.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.560]   The reason we're against it is much more a matter of principle because we believe in
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:21.320]   free and failed trade and really a problem for our finances or our economy outcome.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:31.480]   Got it and then just on the canned sheet front can you remind us of when your larger contracts
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.840]   are up for renegotiation and then just comment around pricing strength?
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:44.480]   So we don't go into the detail of exactly which contract material went but you know that
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.840]   we've got a few renewals coming in around the 22 horizon.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:56.960]   We are making good progress and I think the pricing environment is I would describe it
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:03.680]   as a mildly positive in the US and mildly negative in Europe because of the specific situation
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   now.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:10.880]   I remind you that contractual negotiations take a lot of time here and whilst we you know
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:16.120]   I say it's mildly positive here and mildly negative there between now and whenever we
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:23.840]   actually ink a contract things may change but I think it's a pretty benign environment
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.000]   and our product is in demand.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.840]   I'll brag a little bit our quality and our service is very much recognized.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:38.820]   Mr. Schult has done a terrific job over the past five years and he's a very strong player
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:45.040]   in the market now, very recognized, the quality is service wise and the POSAC has always been.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   So we have a strong position and I'm looking at the future with a great deal of confidence.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   Great.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.040]   Thank you.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.040]   Thank you.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.040]   Thanks Josh.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:02.680]   Your next question comes from the line of BV Dragliano from BMO Capital Markets.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   Your line is open.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.680]   Great.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   Thanks for taking my questions.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.420]   First of all I did have one question on the numbers for the second quarter.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:15.720]   Did you say there was a $15 million one-time benefit included in the $81 million adjusted
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   EBITDA line?
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:22.320]   You're talking about for the labor benefit?
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.480]   I thought it was a COVID-19 state aid benefit is that included in $81 million?
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.560]   Yeah, I think included in adjusted EBITDA.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:35.720]   But it's not a one off and it continues, those programs are what is referred to as a corks
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:42.880]   albeit or short time work and these government programs continue through 2020 and in some
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.960]   cases in 2021.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   Okay, so we should assume about a $15 million quarterly benefit from those programs each
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   quarter?
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:55.800]   Well, yeah, no because what will happen David is remember, so in the second quarter we had
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.120]   a lot of people on the sidelines, right?
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:02.520]   But as we ramp up, then we're going to have substantially less of that.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:09.480]   So I think you should assume that in the businesses, so packaging for example where we have some
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:19.020]   benefit in Q2, we should have basically very limited if any benefit in Q3 and automotive
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:24.440]   which has fade away and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating innovation
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.240]   rate there, but it'll be a much lower number.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.240]   To give you an indication, we mentioned about people being unemployed during the quarter
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.520]   at the trough which is behind us.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:43.520]   We had 6,000 people under some kind of an employment benefit or temporary layoff.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:50.600]   Now we're at less than 2,000, so it's closed dramatically.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.780]   And David, just to put it in perspective, if you get to the fourth quarter, the number
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:03.000]   might be something like 25% of that, just based on the utilization rate, just rough number.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.120]   Okay, that's actually helpful.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.120]   Thank you.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:13.880]   And then just in terms of the individual and market commentary, on the aerospace side obviously
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:23.740]   that's the, or has been the highest margin business and just in terms of the outlet commentary,
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:29.640]   you framed obviously two segments up, one segment down, but the down segment is again the highest
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   margin segment.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.480]   I didn't really get a census to order of magnitude of the down number versus the up numbers.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:40.400]   Can you just give us a census to, do you believe that aerospace will completely offset the recovery
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:48.200]   in auto and packaging in the second half or a bit more color on order of magnitude on the
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.720]   decline in aerospace would be helpful.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:56.280]   So it's very difficult to tell David because we're, as we speak, in very active discussions
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.960]   with our customers and at the end of the day, it's so cold that we have to make it jointly
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.960]   with them.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:08.120]   As I mentioned, we've got contracts whereby we can force them to take some products, which
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.840]   they will take and pay for all, but then they don't need it the following year, right, so
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.840]   they hold the, they hold the inventory, they are holding the back.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:20.200]   So we are looking collaboratively with them in terms of what is it exactly they need,
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.840]   which by the way, I don't think they fully know now and it's no criticism of them.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:31.000]   I mean, it's very unusual time and once we know what they need and we look at what cuts
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.200]   do we take, then I could answer your question possibly.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:42.840]   At this stage I cannot, I would just say that there will be for sure more pain in auto structures
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.600]   and then in auto structures, in aerospace, my apologies, aerospace.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.240]   Now the other thing too is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:40:00.280]   in the recent past, the second half is always weaker than the first half, right, in aerospace.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.240]   So that's something to factor in as well.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:12.320]   Okay, and just, my last related question is, I think you mentioned, I think average utilization
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:19.440]   rates for aerospace related demand in the second quarter was around 60 percent at your facilities,
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.440]   is that right?
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.440]   What is that number now?
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:32.480]   We're running still around that number but I would expect it to go down maybe to 50 percent
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.600]   of that kind of range.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.720]   Okay, all right, that's helpful.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   Thanks very much.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.720]   Okay.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:47.600]   Yeah, so it's important to say we're not expecting it to go down to 30 percent, right, to even
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.480]   that, not on the horizon.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:57.020]   Speaker, your next question comes from the line of Kurt Woodward from Credit Suisse.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.520]   Your line is open.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.520]   Yeah, hi.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.520]   Good morning.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.520]   Hey, Kurt.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:09.000]   Peter, first question, on the hundred million Euro cost reductions, how much of that would
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.760]   you view as structural and then, I guess, just in general, in terms of the amount of cost
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.600]   you think you could take out of the business this year on a permanent basis, can you give
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:25.160]   us an update on those efforts?
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:37.000]   So the biggest piece of that hundred million is related to labor, and that's probably, labor
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.600]   is probably half of that hundred million.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:48.680]   So what we're doing now is we are really closely looking at the business and what it's likely
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   to be like for the next couple of years and then trying to size our labor forces according
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.240]   to that.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:02.520]   So in that regard, I think we would expect that there's going to be some kind of permanent
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.520]   savings.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:11.920]   But remember, as we kind of ramp up the operations, we do expect some of that cost is going to come
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   back, right?
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:20.080]   So I'd say it's hard to give a really precise number on that, Kurt.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.160]   It's a difficult one.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:31.560]   Kurt, if I may add, we have talked about Horizon 22, right, and one of the strategic initiatives
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   was to look at how do we lean our organization without losing competencies, capabilities,
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.040]   but how do we lean and make the organization stronger?
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.800]   And I think what COVID-19 is doing to us and I guess to many other companies out there
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:54.120]   is accelerate the number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:43:01.160]   So along the lines that Peter was saying, I think we'll come out of this with some permanent
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.720]   cost reductions.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.700]   And as we ramp up, we will not ramp up and inject back a hundred million of cost.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:14.120]   How much will remain to be seen because we're really learning as we're doing and we're just
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.640]   in the middle of it now, but we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:26.320]   And there's certain categories like, for example, professional fees, subcontractors, where
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:32.200]   kind of as we work without fees, because those are kind of big categories of reduction,
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:37.920]   I think we're able to kind of live without a lot of that going forward.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:44.400]   So yeah, I think there's definitely a piece about that we can carry forward.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.920]   For example, there are not trivial there, quite revealing, right?
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:54.680]   So we've got a very strong R&D and technical support organization, which is people that
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.320]   are centrally located and go and help plans.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:04.240]   And historically, a lot of the work was done by people going to the location.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:09.360]   Now, obviously, in the past three months, nobody's been able to travel anywhere.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:15.360]   And a lot of that has been done through remote interaction, video conference, but even when
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:23.520]   you go to a plant and you look at, I got a problem and I need to improve the speed on this mill,
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:31.480]   we've had people interacting by the mill tool bit on the face time and looking into the
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:39.440]   rolling mills by face time with the technical advisor on the other side of the planet and
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.920]   that works actually fine, which we wouldn't have thought it would be possible.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:49.200]   So in the future, what you're gaining here is, well, you're saving travel time, which
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:57.440]   is not very good for the aerospace business, but also you're saying the cost, you're saying
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.240]   the time, which means that people can be on several interventions, whereas historically
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.720]   within a week, it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:14.380]   So I think we're going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our space that are
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:18.560]   going to be quite interesting in the future and I think it's going to help us inject more
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.200]   brain and talent remotely with more action.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:31.080]   As we go forward, we may be able to give you more color on this, but hopefully it comes
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:37.240]   across that we're really looking hard at taking structural costs out and in the short term,
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:43.880]   the objective is we want to be kind of free cash flow positive through this crisis so
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:48.800]   that we don't take on any incremental debt ideally and in the longer term, we want to
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.080]   emerge with a kind of much stronger earnings power.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:59.360]   So we're focused on exactly that and we'll have more to say as we progress.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:06.880]   Okay, now that's helpful and then in terms of the pre-cash flow dynamics, you mentioned
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:13.600]   I think it's $73 million impact from backfiring this quarter, otherwise you'd be pre-cash
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.360]   so positive, which is pretty positive given your utilization rate and now you're talking
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:25.480]   about 95% utilization and packaging over 80% and auto and it seems like auto should move
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:33.800]   higher once supply chains get more normalized so 75% of your business could be close to 90%
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:39.480]   utilization and a couple of months I get that arrow is weaker, but it would seem like from
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:47.240]   a free cash flow generation standpoint, unless working capital would be a major negative,
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.960]   you should be generating decent free cash in the back half of the year, can you comment
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:55.520]   at all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year?
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.520]   Yeah, sure.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.520]   Thanks for the question.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:02.760]   So we won't put a specific number on it, but we're confident that we will generate free
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:11.560]   cash flow for the full year and the back half of the year I think there's a very good chance
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.880]   that we can generate some free cash flow, but it depends a lot on what happens with trade
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:21.000]   working capital, as I said we've got the ramp of these businesses so we want to be a little
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:28.960]   cautious until we see the pace of the ramp and the consequences of the ramp, but again for
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.600]   the full year we remain confident that we can generate free cash flow.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:40.560]   Okay and then just final question on arrow Mark, you had a comment on I guess working
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:49.640]   with the OEMs to create you said a clean slate entering 2021, so is that statement kind of
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:55.160]   reflecting the fact that the OEMs cut very quickly and I assume they're sort of an excess inventory
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:01.560]   issue that they're dealing with or in general on supply chain and so hypothetically your
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.720]   volumes would be below the actual bill to rate to help them clear inventory so then when you
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:12.720]   get into 2021 the supply chain is in a pretty good position and contractually you said you're
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:19.360]   not going to force it on them, but then if you're going to help them manage that do you
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:25.960]   get anything in return i.e. price benefit or is this just kind of everyone helping each
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.560]   other just a little bit of an understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.560]   comment.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:38.240]   Well yeah, no fair question so I think I've commented in the past on the fact that I thought
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:44.920]   that the shipments were making into the OEMs right into the supply chain were actually
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:50.120]   higher than what the build rates were warranting at the time and obviously the build rates are
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:57.400]   going down very significantly down so now so the the pain we're going to take in the second
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:05.640]   half I think is not going to cure all the you know inventory build up in the supply chain
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:14.240]   first of all but I think what that does is it positions us for 2021 that doesn't show further
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:19.680]   deterioration that's what we're into right and we want to be in a place where what we
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:25.440]   supply is by and large consistent with what is being built right so that that's what we're
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.440]   trying to do whether we get there fully I don't know but certainly we are aiming to be better
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:40.040]   in 21 than what the second the nine months of you know post covid will be in ANP that's
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:48.720]   that's one of the goals in terms of what we're getting from the OEMs we've got very strong
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:54.480]   deep strategic relationships with them I've commented also in the past from the fact that
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:00.200]   we're in it for the long haul and I think it's evidence by the tenure contract we signed
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:07.880]   with Airbus I mean tenure is a long duration never happened before and we did it because
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:13.640]   it was the right thing to do for both companies for both businesses and we didn't do it as
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:20.720]   a reaction to covid or whatever right I mean that was really the desire to cement the strategic
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   alignment between the two companies so we're looking past the current crisis the current
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:31.780]   crisis we've got to get all in the same boat or in the same aircraft and put us in the same
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:38.120]   place work together to overcome the crisis and we are not talking about you know if I
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:43.640]   do that you give me a bit more price or whatever I think it's just a relationship where we want
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.440]   to be in the win-win partnership and we do some things that help them and they'll do
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:53.440]   something that helps us in the future which I've already done in the past and that's already
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:51:02.560]   that's already happened and that's continuing okay great thank you very much your next question
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:09.320]   comes from the line of Matthew Fields from Bank of America your line is open he done mark
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:15.440]   hey Peter one on the on the markets and then one on the balance sheet please so you know
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:25.160]   saw that can volumes were down about 11% but you know Norse reported can volumes up 11%
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.720]   I think you guys face relatively the same markets in Europe can you can you sort of point to
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:35.060]   why maybe they're having more success on their can volumes was it was it enough for sock
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:39.680]   being down issue or or a market issue or what like what can you just explain that discrepancy
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:46.520]   for us please it's mainly I believe I mean I can't comment on their specific situation
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:52.280]   but in our case the main reason was that we have to take down that exact for a full week
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:58.880]   and then ramp it up gradually I remind you that that was at the center of a hotspot of the
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:06.880]   first real hotspot in France and that was a very terrible conditions for you know second
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:12.880]   half of March so in March we continue to ship out of finish goods but then we have to replenish
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:20.120]   the the finish goods and that's really took down our shipments in the second quarter but
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:27.280]   we're back to normal now okay thank that's sort of what I expected and on the balance
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:33.080]   sheet it looks like you got a decent amount of funding from from France and and obviously
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:40.000]   what's Switzerland and Germany you said it was partially guaranteed but it's also secured
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.240]   can you just give us a better understanding of sort of what it's secured by is it inventory
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:52.000]   or is it sort of PP&E and then to what extent is it guaranteed by the French government
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:00.960]   well it depends on the facility but the big one the French one is secured on on PP&E
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:06.160]   and in the case of the German ones one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured and
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:13.760]   the Swiss one is unsecured and the guarantees what the way they work is they guarantee a
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:20.600]   certain percentage of the principal so it's a normal syndicate of banks with in the case
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:27.320]   of France I think the guarantee is for 70% of the or sorry 80% of the in the case of France
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:33.560]   of the of the principal balance is guaranteed by the by the French state in the case of Germany
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:42.280]   I think it's 80% too just just for for our purposes is credit analyst 80% of that French
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:52.360]   loan is it's sort of non-recourse to you well again it's it is it is recourse to us what
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:57.640]   I think the point is is that if you're a lender so for example if you're in the syndicate
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:06.800]   of banks and you are lending say 50% your responsibility is for 10 or sorry 50% 50 million
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:14.440]   your responsibility is for 10 of that right so the it's the banks that benefit from the
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:21.720]   guarantee not not the company okay so you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:28.480]   yeah absolutely absolutely but one thing yeah I'm sorry the government isn't back stopping
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:35.160]   the loan for you it's not stopping the loan for the banks exactly exactly but one thing
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:42.880]   to you know kind of I think is a really important point is you know our our intent in putting
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:50.240]   this liquidity on the balance sheet was to remove any question about the fact that we have enough
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:56.040]   liquidity as we said from the beginning and based on the performance in the second quarter
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:02.120]   we do not anticipate using this so the French facility we had to draw just by the terms
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:07.720]   of the agreement but it just sits on our balance sheet as cash and the German facility that
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:14.160]   we've now signed up in July you know we don't expect to draw that the DD the delay draw term
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:21.280]   loan we haven't drawn that and the Swiss facility we don't have that drawn in most instances
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:29.000]   so and the way we benefit from the state guarantee is through a very cheap interest rates yeah
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.080]   that's right right that's right cheap money and that was important to us we don't think
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:39.040]   we need the money so we're not going to pay a lot of interest for it yeah exactly that
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:47.000]   and it obviously was an inducement for the banks to lend right now fair enough and that's
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.880]   uh you know I think you the French facility is what two and a half percent effectively
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:56.400]   at this point yeah yeah that's the code all right so you don't really have an incentive
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:01.920]   to pay that off quickly you know given your bonds are kind of twice that right that no
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:08.600]   no that's right now remember the the the use of the cap there are some limitations on the
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:15.200]   use of the capital right so for example we can't use that capital to go in buyback bonds
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:20.920]   in the market so it's really meant to be for you know kind of operating needs of the company
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:27.080]   but yeah you're right we don't have a we don't have a strong incentive to to repay that but
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   what we will what we will do is you know obviously there's some cost to it right so as we kind
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:41.000]   of emerge from the crisis and have a little more visibility than we'll unwind those facilities
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.760]   okay that's uh that's very helpful thanks for all the color and and good luck in the back
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:52.080]   ask thank you thank you your next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrak from Deutsche
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:59.240]   banks your line is open hey guys thanks for taking my questions and really great job on
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:05.960]   transparency and cost here both very helpful thanks just when you think about big picture
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:10.040]   if you look at the auto market there's sort of projections out in the market that we'll
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:16.560]   have about you know 25 percent decline in new cars this year mostly based on the fact that
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:21.840]   we weren't producing back in March April if you look at the used auto market you know it's
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:29.160]   been pretty strong as we've used prices really you know rising even above last year you know
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:34.880]   you talk about how production's been increasing and demand is increasing there you know to
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:41.000]   kind of get to down 25 percent you know you'd have to have some pretty strong growth in 3Q
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.840]   and 3/4 so I guess what I'm asking is do you see that market as potentially inflecting
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:52.120]   soon you know with demand pulling through based on a lack of cars and if you can provide
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:59.600]   a little color what you're seeing there that'd be very helpful yeah so then the other book
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:06.040]   is strong there's no question it's above the 80 percent that I'm mentioning right but we've
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:13.880]   been a little bit caught you know by customers just a few months ago telling us we need product
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.680]   tomorrow and then telling us the next day the plant is shut down right so you know we
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:25.360]   are very vigilant right so I hope I think the end demand is there I think and that's true
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:29.160]   in the U.S. that's true in Europe right the governments have injected a lot of money
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:34.880]   in the hands of consumers right through the targe the unemployment benefits of you know
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:41.000]   different shapes and forms that you see on both continents and that is you know pretty good
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   for end demand at the end of the day so I hope it's going to be it's going to materializing
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   to the order book we have is going to be actually real orders and shipments in which case it
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:03.240]   should be better but you know I've we've seen fits and starts you see plants restarting
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:09.680]   and then shutting down because there's a covid infection or you see people having trouble
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:17.520]   passing you know the false shift because there's too many cases in the hotspot so it's still
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:26.880]   fragile I mean looks quite good but it's still fragile right that's helpful thank you John
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:33.200]   Morgan I guess it's a good lead into the next question so when you think about your customers
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:38.760]   you know we've had some shutdowns we've had things come back online do you do you feel
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:43.060]   that your customers and their CEOs are getting more confidence in their ability to stay
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:49.200]   online or getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curve there yeah
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:56.800]   I would think so I think all of us have made tremendous efforts to provide the proper
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:04.360]   environment for our for our employees it's very interesting I was commenting on the you
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:12.560]   know half of percent of our employees have been affected by covid confirmed we have had
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   no new case confirmed case in Europe since the middle of May so I think it's saying something
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:29.640]   about the fact that when people take responsibility in their daily lives right because it goes beyond
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:35.200]   what they do within our factories or during the eight hours or ten hours whatever they
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:42.760]   work with us you can have an impact and I think you know if people wear masks when they interact
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:50.540]   with outside with people they come across I think it makes a tremendous difference so
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:59.960]   I hope the reality will slowly or more than slowly settle in and good practices will get
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:06.640]   that virus away from us sooner rather than later and I think people are seeing the confidence
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.160]   building up I mean it's human nature you need to be affected to take steps and I think we're
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.720]   in the process where in many places people are still being affected before they take steps
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:21.400]   but if you look at China and China you know going extremely strong you know it's a small
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:29.360]   operation for us but we are above budget above last year right you look at Europe no new cases
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:34.640]   are really on the downward trend even though there's some cluster here and there and we'll
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:46.120]   see a stronger rebound and I hope this is coming to us in the U.S. through the U.S.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:02:08.600]   again I hope everybody's safe and well over there thank you very much and good luck.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:15.000]   Thank you Joanna so thanks everyone for participating in the call today as you can see we are very
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.880]   focused on facing the crisis protecting cash flow and building a stronger constellium when
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.940]   things are behind us.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:30.200]   Thank you very much and look forward to updating you on our progress on Q3.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.200]   Take care.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   Stay well.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.200]   Thank you speakers.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   >> Yes Dan, welcome to the next our Media Group Second Quarter 2020 Results Call.

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Please go ahead sir.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   >> Thank you Anna and welcome everyone.

[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   With that it's now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to your host,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   next our chairman, president and CEO Perry Perry please go ahead.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   >> Thank you Joseph and good morning everyone.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Thank you all for joining us review next are record second quarter results today.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   As we get started I want to acknowledge the next our nation team members for their frontline
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   essential work and tireless efforts to provide viewers and users with continuous access
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   to local news and other services despite the challenges presented by the pandemic and recent civil unrest.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   With our planning and preparation strong balance sheet and commitment to our markets and employees
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm proud to say that next are has kept our employee roster intact
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and our record quarterly results again reflect our team's commitment to flexibility throughout this time.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   As always our chief financial officer Tom Carter is on the call with me this morning.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Next are industry leading scale and diversification are solid executions such as our new business strategies
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and our rapid adoption of cost containment programs at the onset of the pandemic
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   resulted in record second quarter results with all of our cash flow metrics well above consensus expectations.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The 41% rise in second quarter net revenue reflects growth and total television advertising revenue
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   as we drove year over year increases in the same space and new television business
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   and strong shares of political spending in our markets as well as the 71% year over year increase
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   in distribution fee revenues.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   As such despite the economic pressures related to the pandemic next are top line growth
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and operating and expense management disciplines resulted in a 38.7 increase in net income
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   and record second quarter broadcast cash flow adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow with those net metrics growing
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   28%, 49% and 127% respectively on a year over year basis.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   As the world continues to address the health and economic challenges brought on by the pandemic
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   the strengths of our business model and enterprise wide focus on managing operations for free cash flow
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   enabled us to bring about 21% of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   In the year to date period next star has generated approximately $631 million of free cash flow
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   before one time transaction expenses.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   By way of comparison we generated a total of $521 million of free cash flow in all of 2019
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   so our growth momentum remains strong even before the upcoming benefit of political spending in the back half of the year.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Reflecting repurchases made in Q1 we have reduced our share count to approximately 45.5 million shares outstanding
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   so 2020 year to date free cash flow per share amounts to about $13.86 per share
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   and we remain confident in our unique positioning in this environment to again generate significant free cash flow
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   in the current quarter and again in Q4 of this year.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Speaking of the full year 2020 it's important to remember that approximately 60% of our annual revenue
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   is expected to be derived from contractual distribution fee and political advertising revenue
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   which is not expected to be material impacted by the pandemic.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Specifically next star has solid visibility in terms of our contractual distribution economics through December of 2022
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   and completed new multi-year retent submission consent agreements representing approximately 70% of our subscribers at year-end 2019
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   as well as new long-term network affiliation contracts with CBS, Fox and NBC.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   At the same time next star has a strong balance sheet including approximately $665 million in cash as of June 30
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   with an access to another $140 million under our revolving credit facility.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   We continually successfully navigate through the evolving challenges presented by the pandemic
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   based on our core value of serving communities where we operate by delivering leading local news
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and other critical information and content to viewers whether on air or online.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   In this regard next star stations have produced 41 separate town hall meetings addressing state and regional responses to the virus.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Additionally next star has generated over 30 different programs related to recent civil unrest and race relations in our communities.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   With local news and information, while it's never been more essential for Americans
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   the pandemic has changed consumers' media consumption habits in ways that showcase the inherent strength of local broadcast television,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   our content and next star is leading local brands.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   As the most powerful and trusted voice in the country more people are turning into their stations local newscast than ever before.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   According to Nielsen data even as states and localities began to reopen in the second quarter
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   local broadcast television evening news viewership among adults aged 18 to 34 remained impressively high
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   with year over year increases in average cumulative weekly impressions in April, May and June of 151%, 83% and 89% respectively.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Similarly on the digital front next star's web sites and mobile apps grew year over year page views
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   by 250% to 1.1 billion in April with total monthly users up 133% to 96 million.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   We continue to generate strong digital audiences throughout the quarter with weekend and weekend page view traffic across our local web sites
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   up 50 and 60% respectively during the months of June compared to the prior year.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Additionally in terms of unique users next star's digital properties rank number one in the country in local news.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Number 12 in all of news and information and with the number 33 site overall domestically in June as measured by Comscore.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   As the nation's largest producer of local news programming next star's proprietary content provides essential news and information to users and viewers
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   that is unique and relevant to each of the local communities we serve across the United States.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Now more than ever viewers rely on television news to stay informed about everything from the latest pandemic developments
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   to the reopening of the economy to the upcoming election.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   With next star's market leading stations and sites, deep local and national reach and local broadcast record of being the most influential
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   and effective medium for both brands and politicians we expect to see advertisers continuing to allocate increased spending
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   to our broadcasts and digital platforms as this rep resolves.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Turning back to some second quarter highlights total television advertising revenue increased 18.1% to 319.8 million
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   including political revenue of 21.6 million and core advertising revenue of 298.2 million.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   While local and national advertisers adapted their media plans during the second quarter
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   we sought sequential month over month improvement in our same station core advertising revenue performance
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   from April to May from May to June and this trend continuing in July.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Notwithstanding market place challenges, next star's local sales initiatives continue to generate healthy levels of new business
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   with second quarter new to television and revenue rising on both a quarterly sequential and year over year basis.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   In total our sales team generated 20.7 million dollars of second quarter new to television revenue
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   marking 11.3% rise over the first quarter and a 4.5% rise over the comparable 2019 period.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   As I mentioned at the outset of our call our new business strategies, ongoing sales training, education and deployment
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   of performance focused initiatives combined with our sharing of best practices have proven very effective
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   and our ability to capture ad spend and share in both broadcast and digital locally.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   We recorded healthy levels of Q2 spending by political action committees and from candidates
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   with 20 22nd quarter political revenue of 21.6 million exceeding our expectations from early in the quarter
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   despite the cancellation of some primaries. Both presidential campaigns recently generated
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   record levels of fundraising which bodes well for our upcoming political revenues trajectory
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   as such our full year 2020 expectation for net political revenue in the low 400 million range remains unchanged.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Recent distribution agreement renewals and the inclusion of WG in America resulted in a 21%
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I'm sorry a 71% rise in second quarter distribution revenue to 536.5 million representing nearly 59%
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   of total net revenue. Second quarter 2020 total digital revenue declined by approximately 9.6 million
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   dollars or 17% reflecting our focus on higher margin profitable operations while digital
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   profitability was up substantially over the comparable comparable prior year period as our
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   website and mobile app engagement also rose significantly. Total combined second quarter
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   digital and distribution fee revenue of 583.2 million dollars rose approximately 57.1%
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   over the prior year period and rise 64% of quarterly revenues up from 57% in the year ago period.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   The year over year increase in second quarter distribution revenue reflects the new agreements
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   reached in the second half of 2019 and our realization of trillion meter revenue synergies related
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   to the after acquired clauses in our retransmission consent contracts and as noted the inclusion
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   of WG in America. Our expectations for net retrans growth remain unchanged for the balance of the year
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   in the mid teens percentage range reflecting new long term network affiliation agreements with
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   CBS FOX and NBC completed in the second half of 2019 and as a result over 80% of our big four affiliations
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   are contracted through December 31 of 2021 and over 70% of our big four affiliations are contracted
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   through December 31 of 2022. With our successful 2019 renewal of retransmission consent agreements
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   representing approximately 70% of our subscriber base with approximately 17% of the base to be
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   renewed this year our significant net retrans revenue growth in 2020 will complement the strong
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   political growth and spending that we're seeing taking together the affiliation renewals which
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   also include OTT agreements our new retrans contracts and sub levels that remain in line with
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   our forecast we have pretty clear visibility for net retrans revenue growth expectations in 2020
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and beyond. As we discussed on the last call at the onset of the pandemic we took immediate action
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   to adapt our business to address the economic impact on the use of US commercial advertising
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   market. We implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives which resulted in operating
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   and corporate expense savings in excess of $40 million from budgeted second quarter levels.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Looking at the third quarter while the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   we're seeing the same pattern of month over month improvement in our pacing data and expect
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   to benefit from significantly increased levels of political ad spending and in fact our July
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   political billing exceeded that of all of Q2. Overall we're encouraged by continuing signs
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   of recovery across our station footprint and by key economic indicators including employment data
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and consumer spending and at present we're cautiously optimistic about the return of live sports
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   as live news and sports programming continues to generate the strongest levels of viewership
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   across our all demographics. Additionally preparations for the September 1 launch of WG
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   in America's prime time national newscast News Nation which will reach approximately 75
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   million households across the country are proceeding on schedule and on budget. We're in rehearsals
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   now and my first impressions of the product are very positive. News Nation will air daily
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and we'll draw on the local regional and national expertise of
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   NextGar's 5,400 journalists and 110 local newsrooms across the country and during the quarter
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   we announced the anchor teams and correspondents for our live 3-hour prime time national newscast
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   we're already attracting strong interest from leading national advertisers at much higher
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   than normal cost per points for WG in America. Broadcasts will deliver news reporting that is
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   fact-based, impactful and unbiased and we're confident that there are more Americans than ever
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   before who are seeking just that. In addition to the live nightly newscast News Nation's team
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   of reporters and producers will deliver news 24 hours a day online through News Nation's
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   soon to be launched app News Nation Now which will create another opportunity for monetization
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and revenue diversification. As always we remain committed to generating free cash flow, actively
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   manage our capital structure, our cost of capital and our liquidity position to provide the financial
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   flexibility to support our business and enhance shareholder returns as we emerge from the pandemic.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   During the first half of 2020 we allocated approximately $594 million in cash from operations
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and investments toward debt reduction, opportunistic share, repurchases and cash dividends.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Additionally, as I mentioned before NextGar continues to maintain a strong balance sheet including
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   $665 million cash on hand at June 30 with access to additional $140 million under our revolving
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   credit facility. On the return of capital front in late June we declared our third quarterly
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   cash dividend at the new $0.56 per share level which was 24% ahead of last year's payout.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   With our 191% year to date free cash flow growth, our contractual distribution fee revenues,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   our food network distribution, our historically low LIBOR rates which have reduced our interest
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   expense and what is projected to be the biggest presidential election cycle in the company's
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   history, we remain confident in our positioning to be free cash flow positive in every quarter
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   of 2020 and we continue to expect NextGar's net leverage to decline to approximately
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   four times by year end. In summary while the pandemic has presented challenges for most
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   every industry, NextGar's leading local platforms are well positioned to continue building
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   the top line, maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   sheet. Over time our disciplines in these areas have strengthened the resiliency of our business
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   and our business model and created an unrivaled local marketing platform while supporting increasing
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   growing and growing returns for our shareholders. With that said let me turn the call over to
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Tom Carter for our financial review and update. Tom?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Thanks Perry and good morning everybody. As outlined in this morning's press release the actual results
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 reflect the company's legacy NextGar operations
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   and results from Tribune media stations which were acquired on September 19, 2019.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Second quarter 2020 revenue from WG and America also acquired in the Tribune transaction is
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   included in core television advertising revenue and distribution fee revenue.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Contribution from NextGar's 31.3% ownership stake in television food network and other
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   investments acquired in the Tribune transaction is included in the full income statement under
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   income or loss on equity investments net and in the cash flow statement under distributions
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   from equity investments. The comparable three and six month period ended June 30, 2019 reflects
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   legacy NextGar operations during that period. All actual results also reflect the impact
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   of one time transaction expenses incurred in the quarters both in the quarters and the
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   six month period ending June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019. With that with a review of NextGar's
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Q2 income statement and balance sheet data after which I'll provide an update on our capital
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   structure and some points of guidance. On a combined company basis and pro forma for the
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   invested station, second quarter same station net total revenue was down 6% due to a decline
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   in same station core advertising revenue of approximately 35%, reflecting a sharp decline
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   in April due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month improvement from April to May
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   from May to June. Same station distribution fee revenue was up 28% and continuing digital
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   revenues were down 18.2% reflecting local agency services revenue growth of approximately 8%
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   while station website revenue was down approximately 30% due to software local customer buying trends
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   related to the pandemic. To offset the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on commercial advertising
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   revenue late in the first quarter NextGar implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives which resulted
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   in operating and corporate expense savings in excess of $40 million from budgeted levels
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter station direct operating expenses net of trade
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   expense were approximately 414 million up from 292 million in the prior year primarily reflecting
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   the full quarter of incremental expenses associated with the Tribune operations and the budgeted
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   growth in network affiliation expense as a partial offset to our rising distribution revenue.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Second quarter station SG&A was approximately 158 million inclusive of the Tribune operations.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Same station pro forma fixed expenses excluding programming expenses were down 18% over year
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   over year period due to synergies related from the Tribune acquisition and the previously
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   mentioned expense reduction activities in response to the pandemic.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Corporate expenses were 35 million inclusive of 13 million of stock-based comp and approximately
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   5.4 million of one-time transaction expenses. When excluding non-cash comp and one-time
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   transaction expenses recurring corporate expenses were approximately 17 million which came in
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   better than the guidance we had provided in the first quarter call of approximately 21.5
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   million. By the end of April the vast majority of the initial operating synergies of the
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Tribune transaction have been realized. Second quarter operating cash taxes were approximately
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   $6 million substantially lower than our guidance of 45 to 50 million due to a timing difference.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   That 40 to 45 million dollar variance will now be paid in Q3.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Ongoing CAPX and transaction CAPX total $40 million spectrum repack CAPX total 13 million
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   and received approximately 26 million of reimbursements from the FCC during the quarter. As a reminder
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all spectrum related CAPX over the course of the year.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Second quarter total interest expense amounted to $82 million up from $51 million in the same
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   period in 2019 while cash interest expense was $78 million compared to $49 million last year.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   With increases due to obviously the increased debt associated with the Tribune funding
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   partially offset by lower interest rates. Second quarter broadcast cash flow of 291 million
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   as well as adjusted EBICOT 298 million and free cash flow of 200 million all pre-transaction
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   expenses exceeded consensus expectations and primarily reflect the realization of synergies
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   and growth related to the Tribune transaction. Distribution agreement renewals executed
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   in the second half of the year and the deferred cash taxes as I mentioned before.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Adjusted EBICOT and free cash flow reflect approximately $27 million in distributions
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   from equity investments related to our 31% ownership in the TV Food Network. As a reminder
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   we received cash distribution from TV Food on a quarterly basis with the largest payment
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   recorded during the first quarter of each year. For the third quarter of 2020 we anticipate
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   recording approximately $12 million in TV Food Network distributions. We expect cost savings
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   in Q3 to approximate $25 million relative to the originally budgeted levels as variable
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   cost and discretionary expenditures are prudently brought back online with the expected strengthening
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   of the economy and the broadcasting advertising environment. For the third quarter we project
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   recurring cash corporate overhead exclusive of stock comp and transactions cost to be approximately
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   $23 million and we will easily meet our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance for approximately
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   $120 million for the entire year. Non-cash comp is projected to be approximately $13 million
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   for the quarter and $48 million for the full year. Transaction expenses will approximate
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   $3 million for the quarter and will decline for the remainder part of the year. Third quarter
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   operating cash taxes are now estimated to be approximately $150 million and operating cash
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   taxes for the entire year will now come in at approximately $250 million in total. Non-operating
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   cash taxes associated with the gains on the asset sales and legal sentiments in Q3 will
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   be approximately $83 million. Third quarter cash tax should have come in at approximately
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   $40 million and we're still expecting approximately $160 million for the entire year. We're proceeding
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   on budget with our investment related to the launch of WGN America's Prime Time National
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Newscast News Nation on September 1 and prioritize capital expenditures to maintain maximum flexibility
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   in the current environment meaning the timing of certain tasks can be delayed until later
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   quarters if required. Finally we expect next star's cash interest expense to approximately
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   $78 million for the third quarter and $325 million to $350 million for the full year reflecting
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   interest expense savings related to the decline in LIBOR rates. Turning to the balance sheet
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   next star's outstanding debt at June 30 was approximately $8 billion and consisted of $5.4
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   billion of term loans and two series of senior subordinated notes, one at approximately $900
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   million and the other at $1.8 billion with maturities of 2024 and 2027 respectively. Total net
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   debt approximated $7.4 billion at June 30 compared to $7.6 billion at March 31 and $8.3 billion
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   at 1231 2019. Net debt for first lean covenant purposes is $5.2 billion with net cash limited
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   to a $200 million amount. Our first lean covenant ratio at June 30 was approximately 3.11 compared
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   to 3.52 at year end which is well below our first lean covenant of four and a quarter. As
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   a reminder, our first lean covenant limits cash netting to approximately $200 million. Our total
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   net leverage at quarter end was 4.47 compared to 5.18 at year end and as a reminder, next
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   star's only covenant is our first lean debt covenant which is the aforementioned four
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   and a quarter. At the onset of the pandemic, next star took immediate actions to adopt our
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   business to the current environment and preserve liquidity in order to best position the company
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   under long-term success as we return to normalized operations. In this regard, we continue to prioritize
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   cash retention and add approximately $231 million to our first quarter cash position for a total
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   cash balance of $665 million at June 30 with an additional $140 million available under
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   our evolving credit facility. At the same time during the second quarter, we returned approximately
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   $25 million to shareholders through the quarterly cash dividend and made $13 million in payments
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   on our debt. During the first half of 2020, we have accurately managed our capital structure,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   cost of capital and liquidity position to support our business in this challenging environment
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   while enhancing shareholder returns. Year to date, we have allocated approximately $594
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   million towards shareholder value creating initiatives including $473 million in debt reduction,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   $51 million in dividend payments and $73 million in share repurchase.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   In the near time while preliminary data suggests ongoing sequential improvement in economic trends
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   and the commercial advertising environment, we continue to focus on cash preservation
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   in order to optimize our financial flexibility as we move through the third quarter.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Looking ahead with continued double digit year over year growth and distribution revenue and
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   what are expected to be robust spending levels related to the upcoming presidential election,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus, we have excellent visibility
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   on over 50% of our annual revenue in 2020. As such, we expect to be free cash flow positive
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   in the third and fourth quarters. In addition to continuing our dividend payments, we remain
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   committed to allocating the vast majority of our free cash flow towards leverage reduction
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and confident in reaching our target level for the reduced level of total net leverage to
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   four times by year end 2020. Next star has already made significant progress on our leverage
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   reduction plan and we enjoy a strong cash position with additional capacity under our remover.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   In addition, the reduction in interest rate expense related to favorable LIBOR rates operating
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   expense savings and our capital allocation prioritization will also serve us well in the second half
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   of 2020. As a result, we're confident in our liquidity position and the ability to service
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   our debt through these challenging times and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   as we move through the year. In summary, despite the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   our scale leadership flexibility synergy realization and operation plans are generating results.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Our capital structure is in great shape from a cost of capital maturity and ability to quickly
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   address leverage. In addition, our service to our local communities and local and national
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   advertisers has never been stronger. Our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   as well as consistency and visibility to our results and we remain confident in our ability
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   to enhance shareholder value in the near term and on the other side of the pandemic.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   That concludes the financial review for the call. I'll now turn it over back to Perry for some
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   closing remarks before Q&A.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Thanks very much, Tom. In summary, I hope that our comments today reinforce the fact that we remain
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   confident in the strength and the resilience of NeXTAR's scaled and diversified business model.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   NeXTAR's leading local platform is well positioned to withstand this environment due to several factors
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   including our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs, the continued growth of our
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   distribution revenue stream and what are projected to be record levels of political spending
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   here in 2020. In terms of capital allocation, we believe that our free cash flow combined with
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   the active management of both our cost structure and our balance sheet will provide us with
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   financial flexibility to continue supporting our shareholder value creation initiatives.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   As a result, NeXTAR is well positioned to fully participate in the recovery and we remain highly
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   confident in our core strategies in terms of serving the communities where we have operations
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   and building the top line, maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   This focus combined with our time proven operating strategies is enabling NeXTAR to overcome the near
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   term challenges and extend our long term record of growth and shareholder value creation.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   We look forward very much to catching up with you with another positive report just after
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Election Day and on behalf of the entire NeXTAR nation, our board and our management team
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   thank you for your continued interest, support and for joining us today.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   So now let's open the call to Q&A to address your specific areas of interest. Operator?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Yes, I'm Dean Kingerle and if you would like to ask a question please click on my pressing star one
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function has turned
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   off to allow yourself to reach your equipment. Again that is star one if you would like to
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   ask a question and we'll take our first question from John Janities with Wolff Research.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   Thank you. Paria, two for you. One is you talked about local news and viewership.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   What do you think in terms of advertising your demand in growth and news relative to the
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   day cards given the ratings you spoke to and then I guess the sub levels along the expectations
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   is the reintroduce that there's been no noticeable impact from the pandemic or is that
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   your students are calling given the likes? Well as it relates to local news you know through
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   the first six months of this year 51% of our total advertising revenue came from local news
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   and that's up over the prior years cumulative totals which indicates obviously advertisers
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   you know are putting their money into that product with increasing frequency.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Obviously the demand is where the audience is and that's where the audience is for us right now
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   and so we do see continued read through and we're hopeful that the audience gains at least some
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   of them will be sticky when you know and I hate to use this term when the new normal settles
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   in as to whatever that is but so far through this normal people in all age groups are tuning
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   to our local news broadcasts in increasing numbers. I will say that obviously MBPD's have reported
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   sub counts and attrition for the quarter you know those are factored into our projections
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   and analyses and our retrans revenue is again we forecast attrition into our budgeting
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   process and we are at budget on retrans revenue and our projections through the end of this
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   year so we have seen no significant decline beyond what we had forecasted so we think
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   it's business as usual from a distribution revenue standpoint.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Thanks very much. Our next question will come from Steven Cole with Wells Fargo.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Thanks. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about your reverse compensation agreement
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   as sub declines are accelerating I was wondering if that's changing the tone of those at all
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   and also does it make you think about moving from like a per sub basis sorry to a per sub
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   basis from a fixed programming fee where you can and relatedly we have more broadcast content
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   going direct to consumer like CBS All Access and Peacock so how do you think about monetizing
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   those households that may not be subscribing through the traditional process?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Sure you know I would say you know the current relationships with the networks are a mix
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   of fixed fee and percentages of distribution revenue so there are some that are fungible
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   others that are not and those conversations are continuing what's in the best interest
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   of both parties to get a deal done so there is some hedge there at this point and we're
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   not ready to call the ball as to what the most preferable term is there based on our negotiating
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   ability as it relates to CBS All Access we participate in that we're paid to be a part
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   of that service and our local stream is a part of that offering Peacock we are not affiliate
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   local news affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast offering and we're not
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   sure if at any point they will be but you know we do have this thing called over the air
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   which you know we reach you know a much larger universe potentially than the wired pay cable
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   universe already where you know 16% of our viewers already use that as their reception
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   device without the aid of a pay wall and that's available to those who want to quote
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   stream us that way if you will and the good news about that is there are far few competitors
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   for eyeballs in an over the air world than there are in a 500 plus cable or satellite
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   universe so again we we are in flux we have a lot of our agreements nailed down through
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   21 and 22 we do have some that will be up at the end of this year and early next year and
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   that's where those conversations will center around what's the best type of agreement
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   for both companies to enter into.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Great and then just one on political four years ago we kind of got a head fake at the last
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   minute from the Trump campaign in terms of not spending what was expected I don't think
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   any of us expect that to happen this time but when do you feel comfortable that there's
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   not going to be any negative surprises on the political spending side?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Well I'm pretty comfortable in that right now I mean look at the amount of money that both
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   camps have raised that the attendant PACs and special interest groups have raised supporting
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   those candidates as well as down down valid candidates you know there are no guarantees
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   but as close as the guarantees I'll make is there'll be no negative surprise on political advertising.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   That's a pretty good guarantee thank you.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   We'll now take our next question from Zach Silver with B Riley.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Okay great thanks for getting the question the first one is just if you can quantify the
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   sequential improvement for core in July versus total 2Q20 or even the pro forma year over
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   change so far in July and then more broadly and I think it's a little bit related to Stephen's
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   question you know the narrative out there has been that the macro environment and growth
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   and streaming is going to accelerate the shift of ad dollars from linear TV to connected TV
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   and streaming can you talk about how well positioned you are to address that if that narrative
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   does turn out to play out?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   I'll let you address how linear you want to get on guidance obviously we saw substantial
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   sequential improvement in core ad trends in July versus not only June but the entire quarter
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Tom I don't know if you want to add any more details to that but I'll let you speak to that.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Sure well I think what I'll say about July is obviously July was substantially better than
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   the second quarter as a whole and July was better than the last month of the second quarter
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   so sequentially things have gotten better and that trend continues into early Q3.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   As it relates to additional streaming services you know there at some point there becomes
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   kind of a sameness to them and you know it's all about the content if you have the content
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   that people want they will find a way to consume you whether that's over the year
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   or whether that's through a pay service or through a streaming service that we're paid to be on
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   and without our services you have an inferior offering to the viewing public.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   It is obviously demonstrated that local news is a product that people want and are willing
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   to pay for and so I think we'll just stand by that you know it's a lot less noisy at the
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   operating level than it is perhaps at the investor level about these streaming services.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   You know is it a fragmenting universe but are they just taking from a wire you know from
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   a traditional pay TV universe into a virtual pay TV universe and if so and we're on both
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   sides of that transaction it's not nearly the noise that it appears to be in the investment
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   community so we're somewhat sanguine about it you know we have a product that people want
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   we're the largest producer of it in the country it's called local news and we believe
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   that product will stand the test of time as it has for the last 40 years test of time.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Yeah I think that makes sense and one more if I could does the I guess for Tom there's a target
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   leverage ratio for this year contemplate any buybacks in the second half and can you remind
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   us of where we are in resuming repurchase program thanks.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   It does I won't say how much of it is allocated to stock repurchases the way we think we have
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   an authorization left from the board we're currently not buying stock but I would anticipate
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   that to get revisited here in the not too distant future the way we think about it is really
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   starting on Labor Day and quite honestly that's probably not doing service to the fact that
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   it's pretty mentioned July political revenue is very strong and we think August will be
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   as well we're rapidly transitioning out of this being a story during the pandemic just
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   about poor advertising revenue and what's happening there the other leg two legs to the
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   stool from our perspective distribution revenue has been strong continues to be strong as
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Perry mentioned we're on budget for the year we're on budget for the second we were on
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   we were actually above budget for the second quarter we're on budget for the third quarter
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   with regard to retransmission revenues and then the third leg of the stool is political
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   and that's really going that candle is going to get lit here right around Labor Day and run
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   really hard for the two months of September October in the first week of November so the
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   free cash flow with the company will continue to go along nicely and then get turbocharged
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   by free cash flow from political beginning around Labor Day as I've said to other people
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   I fully expect our our capital allocation attitude to change from playing defense to playing
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   offense sometime right around Labor Day we're not there yet but I can see there from here
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   and when that happens then I would imagine we wouldn't sit here with an unnatural $600 million
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   of cash on our balance sheet we deploy that by actually repaying debt and looking at stock
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   repurchases but that's a multivariable equation tell me what the stock is around that time
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   and I'll tell you what our appetite is right is that responsive yeah that's helpful thank
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   you both I just want to add to Tom's comment about political you most folks woke up this
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   morning reading about the you know Biden's buy that he's placing starting on September
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   first in 15 states well we operate substantial operations in 12 of those 15 states so just
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   to point out that you know political will reach a crescendo around Labor Day that will continue
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   on through the first week of November and again with July results being above all of second
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   quarter for political you know that's a pretty good pretty good measure I think of what's
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   yet to come and so we remain competent in our political guidance and as that story continues
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   to prove then I think you'll see Tom exercise more optionality around our cash forward that
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   currently exists on the balance sheet.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Got it.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Thanks Gary.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   We'll now take our next question from Erin Woff with Deutsche Bank.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Hi guys thanks for having me on a couple questions on the ad environment I guess first there's
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   been some fits and start in terms of COVID cases in the pockets of the country what behavior
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   impacts in your markets that have been affected by that and I guess on a related note in terms
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   of categories just give me the importance of the auto category anything you can give us
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   in terms of how that rebound is shaping up and what you're expecting from auto in the next
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   couple months.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Yeah auto has rebounded you know we're seeing better pacing and better results in Q3 than
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   we did in Q2 when dealers were shut down we're seeing certain of the OEMs move money around
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   from market to market based on where they have cars and that's primarily affected some of
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   the foreign name place but on the whole I think our expectations for auto are that it will
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   be left down sequentially going forward as will most of core advertising.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   As it related to COVID I didn't know if you meant how it affected the company or what we're
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   seeing in our markets but I can give you a little color on both we have had 145 confirmed
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   cases in the company since the beginning of the pandemic remarkably out of a workforce
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   of about 13,000 of people that are out in the community we've only had one hospitalization
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   and that person is fully recovered about 60% of our employees are working from the facility
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   to which they are assigned we have another 20% that are reporting to work but not necessarily
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   in the facility reporters meeting their crews in the field to go to their first assignment
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   things of that sort and we have another 20% that are working remotely and I use the example
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   with our board that everybody in Topeka is reporting to work however nobody is populating our New
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   York offices because of the public transportation requirements and they don't feel safe and
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   there's certainly no mandate to do that and so that's kind of a proxy for the country.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   We keep tabs by every market as to you know various stages of reopening I would say that
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   all of our markets have some degree of reopening some more than others there have been some
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   pauses in California and Texas and others on further reopening areas have been rolled
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   back you know bars and restaurants are not necessarily big advertising categories with
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   us to begin with hospitality continues to be a category where we see no spend to speak
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   of there is some interest state tourism ads that are going on like if you're in Texas come
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   to Arkansas and vice versa in Oklahoma we're seeing some of that but hospitality for us
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   is a sub 2% category that you know is not materially driving our top line so Aaron I don't know
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   the kind of flavor you were looking for but I'm happy to answer any more specific follow-up.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   One last one for me and I appreciate the time again.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   You spoke to the important local news and the ad revenues that come in attached to that to
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   the overall revenue pie if we're thinking about the potential that maybe NFL football is delayed
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   or college football doesn't happen in the fall how do we think about the flow through
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   of that potential and what it could mean to your revenue pie?
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Sure I'm glad you asked that it's interesting at the local station level which is where we live
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   all sports comprises about 10% of our advertising revenue and of that the NFL comprises about
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   60% of that 10% so let's just in real round numbers say that ad revenue support is half
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   of our revenue and NFL is 6% of 10% of that so we're talking about three points of revenue
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   so from an advertising perspective because of the limited avails that the local stations
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   get in all of local sports or all of televised sports that's not local you know it's not
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   that big of a contributor but obviously it has an outsized effect on viewership on promotional
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   ability and I would say on the national psyche and on people's morale obviously distributors
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   are very interested in live sports because they know live sports and live news drive viewership
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   but from a pure financial advertising point of view it's not all that material to our top
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   or bottom line.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Okay perfect that's exactly what I was looking for stay well guys.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Hi two questions first wondering if you could give us some color on what you're seeing in
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   terms of subscriber declines in your markets curious how they compare to the overall industry
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   and any color on advertising and distributor reception to news nation and any expectations
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   for when you might see some incremental revenue lift from news nation.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Thanks.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Tom I'll let you re-read the subscriber and then I'll talk about Tia and how's that?
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Sure I would say our experience with subscribers is not materially different than that of the
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   MVPD's obviously we are still getting an uplift from the virtual MVPD's so that the traditional
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   MVPD subscriber loss is somewhat recouped but certainly not all recouped by the virtual
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   MVPD's and as Perry had mentioned obviously we factor in in our budgeting process and
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   in our guidance process you know an attrition rate for subscribers and a unit rate for our
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   revenue and as we mentioned that was basically in line for the second quarter and early returns
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   for the third quarter are consistent with that expectation so not getting into specific
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   subscriber decline numbers etc. I would say that we see and feel the same thing that the
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   you know the distributors do it's just that our you know our economics are a little bit
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   different because we've got you know rate that helps us offset that but it's consistent
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   with our expectations. As relates to WGN America we have had and you know Dana Zimmer and her
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   team have been out presenting WGN America to every MVPD with which we already do business
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   and also those that do not carry WGN WGN America and that's primarily in legacy next star markets
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   and we have an opportunity with renewals between now and the end of the year for an incremental
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   approximately 200 to 250 thousand subs that could add WGN America and these are smaller
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   systems again where next car has a relationship but there was no trivial relationship that
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   would have included WGN America so there is upside there and and I would say that the
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   reception from distributors has been positive particularly from those who have existing
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   contracts and realized there's going to be additional value add for no additional cost
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   during the term of the current agreement we are distributed on AT&T now as the the only
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   virtual MVPD service that is offering WGN America we are efforting to get distribution
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   at the launch or shortly thereafter on other OTT services and that will be value add where
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   WGN America is not currently distributed but the reception from both the advertising community
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   and the distribution community has been positive because we're investing in a product that will
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   add value to their businesses as well.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   Great.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Thanks for that.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   We'll take our next question from Dan Acredos with Benchmark.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Thanks.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Good morning.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Slim Pickens last year after the strong prints and all the questions but I guess I'll ask
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   you one follow up to the prior Perry I don't know if you're willing to sort of good color
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   on subcarriage incremental opportunity is there any way for us to think about sort of timing
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   and higher thinking about the news nation impact itself relative to either advertising
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   or I guess answer early with that your comment on carriage we know it's going to be self funding
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   obviously you have plans to kind of expand it so just any help kind of framing your thoughts
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity and then separately, you know, obviously there's
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   been a lot of noise lately in the digital world Facebook Twitter Advoid products all of that
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   fun stuff.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   You guys are the largest.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   You guys have a pretty big network effect and a pretty strong digital portfolio yourselves.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   Is there any accrued benefit to you guys or do you think that stays mostly in the digital
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   bucket?
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   Thanks.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   I'll speak first to WGN America the we have.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   I'm very impressed with the job that they wrote him in the sales team have done in assembling
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   advertisers for the premiere premiere week of WGN America's news nation blue chip names
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   and in a cost for points that are in excess of I should say cost for thousands that are
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   in excess of 50% greater than what standard programming was generating alone.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   So that's a very positive initial indication we're trying to rework some of the existing
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   buys into the news nation prime time offering and so what we could really use is, you know,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   an upfront or a fourth quarter scatter market to break but all of that said we do anticipate
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   an incremental let's call it low eight figure revenue contribution to WGN's ad revenue in
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   the four months of the end of this year and again given the size and scope of the operation
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   that wouldn't be deemed to be material but we do even in these conditions expect, you know,
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   a low eight figure uplift in gross revenue there and distribution that will mostly come
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   at the end of the year so will impact 2021 more than this year there have been some incremental
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   deals done already that will launch WGN America between now and the end of the year but I
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   would say the vast majority of that impact would be felt in 2021 and again you're talking
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   a potential uplift of, you know, a quarter of a million subscribers on a, you know, Nielsen
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   reported I think 75 million subscriber base so even that is incremental but it's all incremental
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   and that's what we're going to do is drive incremental growth out of the assets that we own.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   And then the thoughts on either Facebook, Twitter as it relates to core political if that stays
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   in the digital bucket or if you could pick some of that up? Yeah, listen I think the most direct
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   transfer could be in political if people, you know, if certain platforms are refusing
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   those ads that money has to go somewhere and, you know, without conventions to fund and without
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   rallies to fund the one way to reach people is through broadcast television I think we're
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   seeing an evidence of that right now so I think that would be probably the direct transfer
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   you know with all the boycats and all of that I don't think you've seen a substantial decline
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   in digital revenue performance on those platforms so at this point the damage is more
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   reputational than financial and we'll see, you know, how deep the government wants to get
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   involved in taking a look and potentially regulating these companies more symmetrically with the
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   way we're regulated but at this point I think the financial transfer outside of
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   political to the best of our knowledge is minimal. Got it super helpful thanks for the
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   color in the next quarter. Thanks. Our next question will come from Greg Hubbard with
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Hubbard Research Partners. Yes good morning thank you. A few questions. Last quarter
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   on your conference call I believe you guys said your retransubs were down 4.5 percent
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   year over year as you guys may know Sinclair on the call right before yours said the
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   second quarter subs were down about 7 percent including the benefit in the
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   virtual side should I assume that you guys were down roughly about 7 percent for the
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   second quarter for your subs is that reasonable slightly worse than the first quarter? No.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   Should I assume so it's a little bit better than that then or can you just help me
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   understand your question? I would say it's more consistent with the second quarter.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   The second quarter I'm sorry you need more consistent with the first quarter down
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   4.5? Oh I'm sorry with what we announced the first quarter you're right
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   first quarter so I wouldn't say it's down 4. Correct I'm not going to get the exact number
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   you guys said that it's not down 7 but it's closer to the previous quarter's results.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   Okay I appreciate that. Can you help us your TV advertising pacing for the month of
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   August would you say that those are tracking better the rate of decline if your
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   core advertising for that is tracking better than what you or what July turned out to be?
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   I think it's a little we have very you know few days in August here I'm thinking
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   you know it's a little too early to be making any comments with regard to that.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Okay can you help us then maybe just I'm trying to understand then what you're
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   sort of budgeting or thinking the rate of decline if your core advertising could be
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   down in the third quarter that's why we're not that's why we're not giving guidance
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   right it's going to be down again how much July was down if you would?
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   I think I told you it was down less again I'm not going to give specific numbers
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   but July was down less than June and June was obviously if it's just math if the
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   entire quarter was down 35% and every month within the second quarter got
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   better then clearly June was down less than 35% and July was down less than
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   June that's kind of the extent of the forward looking guidance that we're going
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   to give as it relates to specific advertising revenue.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Okay maybe let me ask another question then in this on this virus situation
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   that's going out there in the states where the virus cases have gotten dramatically
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   worse here in the last several weeks have you guys seen a material change in the
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   core TV advertising in those markets is there any significant change or you can
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   talk about that? No and again you know cases in Texas have gone down you
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   know yeah but we don't operate just in one area that you're in that you might be
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   hearing that news from right so you've got to look across 114 markets and look
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   at you know those states and you know cases might be reported to be up 30%
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   which could be a hundred cases in a state I mean you've got to put all of these
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   numbers into context but I would say no the evidence is in you know in our results
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   in July and our pacing in August and our pacing in September all substantially
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   better than where we exited second quarter and then we performed in second
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   quarter so you know the proof is in the numbers as Tom says it's just math but
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   you know we have not seen any and I think I just said this you know hospitality
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   continues to be down auto is improving we don't get a lot of money from restaurants
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   unless it's QSR and they're making mints through their drive through so you know
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   things are we're seeing steadily in steady improvements and even we're you know
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   pausing and opening is better than not being open at all and that's that's kind
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   of our worst case scenario in some of our markets and in others we don't have that
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   you know this morning we're dealing with the aftermath of storms up the east coast
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   from the Carolinas into Virginia and up into Pennsylvania New York and flooding
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   and those kinds of things and those are going to be more you know temporary
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   disruptors to businesses until they they can reopen then then the pandemic and so
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   it's situational and we deal in 38 states across the country and you've got to add
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   it all together but there's you know nothing other than business as usual is
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   the way we deal with things and I think the results speak for themselves.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   My last question guys on the cost front you guys talk about pro forma cost in the
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   second quarter down 18% can you give us a little bit more to how we should we think
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   about your cost trends for the third quarter I know you gave a figure there
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   versus your budget for the third quarter somewhere one for the second quarter
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   but just what sort of cost that you could help us a little bit think about that
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   may not repeat the cost savings and third quarter you benefit from in the second
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   thank you.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   I really don't understand the question other than the fact obviously we had
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   guided to $40 million in cost takeouts in the second quarter
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   which we believe you know which we over performed on that same number for the
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   third quarter is 25 million as we obviously some of those are variable costs as
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   advertising starts to return those costs go up some of them are discretionary
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   that we will add back in we will travel more in the third quarter than we did
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   in the second quarter we basically couldn't have traveled any less in the second
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   quarter than we did so some of the discretionary cost will get added back in
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   but that will be more than offset by higher advertising revenues in the second
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   quarter but specifically as it relates to you know if you're looking year over
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   year the majority of the synergies taken out of the Tribune transaction have
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   occurred so that won't change materially sequentially Q2, Q3 over Q2 and you'll
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   have some added expense coming back in but that's the extent of some of the
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   the pushes and the pulls on expenses.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   You answered well thank you appreciate that guys.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   We'll now take our next question from John Cornwright with J.K. Media. I hope you can hear
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   me having problems like a lot of people in the neighborhood. Two quickies. Tom I
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   think the 24 bonds were callable two days ago and I heard nothing that is being
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   not likely to be called. Well again John I think that's consistent with our
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   message that you know in the next 30 to 45 days I think we will have a better
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   feel on actual political revenue coming in you know Labor Day and obviously same
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   with another month of core and we'll be able to start making more aggressive
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   decisions with regard to capital allocation in the you know obviously in the last
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   hundred and twenty days and probably the next 30 days we're still going to continue
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   to take a pretty conservative view on that but hopefully be able to flip the
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   switch and become a little bit more aggressive in the near term.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   Secondly did I hear correctly that you're on track for mid-teens next
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   retrans growth this year and you mentioned that the growth the growth retrans is up
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   high 20s pro forma. Did I hear correctly growth of high 20s net mid-teens?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   So far this year our our retrans revenue growth has exceeded 20% that is
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   correct we have budgeted for mid-teens yes well 28 in the second quarter I don't
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   get what exactly the first quarter is we budgeted for mid-teens growth in net
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   retrans for the entire year but so far we have exceeded that.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   So net retrans margins are down you know more than a little bit this year is that
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   correct? No I would say that they're actually up a little bit because we're
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   we've included a fair amount of pervune subscribers that are non big four affiliates
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   where our net retrans margin you know is substantially in excess of 50%.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Got it thank you very much.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   We'll now take our next question from Jim Goss with Barrington Research.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Thanks during the early days of the pandemic there seemed to be a surge
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   or a pretty good increase at least and usage and even sampling of broadcast
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   and other video in categories that didn't take or didn't tend to bounce.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   Support is to be requested if you would like to handle this request please press
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   star zero again. Not sure what happened there.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   But I was wondering if any of that has proven sustainable?
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   If you would like to cancel this request please press star zero again.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   I'm sorry I haven't heard.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   Go ahead Jim I think somebody's trying to either record or exit the call.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   Okay sorry. But anyway I was wondering if any of the increased usage
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   and sampling has proven sustainable or has it mostly dissipated
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   and did any of that play a role in your retrans negotiations during that period?
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   We had precious few retrans negotiations done in the first half of the year.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   We had one top 10 that we're pleased with the results on.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   I would say in my comments earlier I did report that our viewership
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   and I highlighted the 18 to 34 demographic obviously was up in April 151%,
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   83% in May and 89% in June over the prior year.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   Our digital page views which were in excess of 2.3 billion for the quarter were
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   1.1 billion in April that was up 133% and then in the month of June just by
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   comparison our local websites were up 60% compared to the prior year.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   There is some COVID fatigue I think but I also think there is increased
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   interest in local news and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   of local news with the diminuation of newspaper and radio local coverage
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   and content so we do think that there is stickiness to this.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   The long tail will determine how much but people continue to turn
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   to our newscasts and record numbers and it's amazing.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   ATLA in Los Angeles and WGN in Chicago independent stations by and large
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   but producing copious amounts of local news are ranking number 1
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   in all day cards meeting all of the network O and O's in virtually every newscast
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   and it just speaks to the power of localism that you're not dependent on
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   network lead in or lead out to generate your audience, you're doing it on your own
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   and we're particularly gratified by that kind of execution producing those kinds of results.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   One last thing, I was wondering about the promotion efforts to create
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   visibility for news nation as that is coming to the fore and also it seems
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   like CNN tended to fill a similar role to that which you're targeting
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   where they tend to be unbiased maybe it's a little less so these days
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   and during that era it would tend to be the place to go when something
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   an event occurred but some of the other news more pointed newscasts
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   politically would sort of gather their base in more normal times
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   so I'm wondering if there's a way for you to position yourself to sort of gather
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   at least that role and maybe you know maybe have something more sustainable
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   and if this proves successful do you think you're broadening it beyond the
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   three-hour original timeframe?
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   Well thanks Jim there's a lot in there to unpack I'll try and do my best with it here
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   and obviously you know that is how CNN started I don't think anyone listening
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   to this call think CNN is in that same place today from unbiased political lean
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   we, as I've said before, we have a staff of
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   and two full-time staff that do nothing but check scripts and reporting for
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   unconscious bias and bias in our writing and we've had very spirited discussions
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   about that even in the rehearsals you know we do think we will be that
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   place to go for news that doesn't make a 22-minute news hole in a network evening
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   news broadcast or much news on the opinion-based talk networks
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   for example last night in our rehearsals we did a story on the first women police
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   chief in Colorado Springs and that's not a story you'd see every place else
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   but again we've got our country divided up into six zones and we have zone producers
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   and their job is to know exactly what's going on in those zones in all of those
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   newsrooms and what might be of interest to a national audience in addition to the
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   150 people we hired in Chicago correspondents that are also based in Miami,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   New York, Dallas, Los Angeles and DC that report exclusively for the network
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   as well as all the behind-the-scenes production folks that we think we can give
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   a more representative view of America than perhaps what's seen inside the New
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   York DC Beltway so we think there's a purpose for that and there's a reason
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   for that and the acceptance of that concept now it has been very enthusiastic
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   it's now just on us to deliver as it relates to promotion we have secured
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   something that none of the other networks news networks I think are able to
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   compete with and that is to harness the power of 196 television stations across
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   the next star nation to promote this newscast on a day-to-day specific basis
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   beginning later this month and if you look at the annualized promotion value
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   that the stations will be contributing on a dedicated basis it's something approaching
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   $100 million we are layering on top of that on an annualized basis approximately
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   $20 million of outside promotion expense which primarily goes for advertising
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   on other cable networks because we're just a channel change away at that point
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   on national and syndicated radio we're also you know investing heavily in social
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   media not only because of the app but to try and drive a younger demographic to
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   an alternative newscast and so we think our promotion spending you know all taken
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   together you know a nine-figure amount of both cash and in-kind contributions for
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   the company are another asset that will hopefully drive success for this effort
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   and again it's you know it is a counter-programming opportunity in prime
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   time and we're going to do our best to succeed there obviously if we are successful
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   we would look at other day parts but we're taking very much of a crawl walk
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   run approach to this we want to get it right and and you know we will grow as
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   fast as our success would allow us to grow so I think I'd leave it at that but
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   you know we're very excited about the prospect of introducing an alternative
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   in prime time to entertainment sports and opinion programming and that the product
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   will reach a we'll strike a chord and resonate with the audience and then
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   you know audience growth and advertiser growth will continue so tune in it launches
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   on September 1st. Thank you Katherine.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   And that concludes our question and answer session for today and I'd like to turn the
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   conference back over to Mr. Sook for any additional or closing remarks.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   Well thank you operator again we're we're very pleased at our progress and we're
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   pleased at our strong financial position and we're excited about the launch of WG in
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   America and the advent of the political spending season that will all be upon us
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   before our next call so we look forward reporting back to you shortly after
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   election day with the the early results on all of those efforts and thank you very
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   much for your time this morning thanks for joining us.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   Once again that concludes today's conference we thank you all for your
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   participation you may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Aldera Therapeutics Second
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.800]   Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.320]   At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.260]   After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session.
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.640]   To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.800]   If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.120]   Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.420]   If you require further assistance, please press star zero.
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.920]   I would now like to introduce the company's chief financial officer, Mr. Josh Reedy.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.320]   Mr. Joshua Reedy, thank you, you may begin.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.360]   Thank you and good morning everyone.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.800]   On the call with me are Dr. Todd Brady, Aldera's president and chief executive officer and David
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.360]   McMullen, our chief commercial officer.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.880]   Dr. Brady will begin with an overview of our recent highlights and upcoming clinical milestones.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.680]   I will discuss our second quarter financial results and then we'll take your questions.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.600]   Please note that this morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements regarding
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.720]   future events and the future performance of Aldera.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.560]   Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the timing of planned clinical
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.920]   trial initiation, Aldera's possible or assumed future results of operations, expenses and
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.040]   financial position, business strategies and plans, research development and commercial
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.960]   plans or expectations, trends market sizing, competitive position, industry environment
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.840]   and potential growth opportunities, among other things.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.960]   These statements are based upon the information available to the company today.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.400]   As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical site availability, staffing and patient recruitment
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.920]   have been negatively affected and the timelines to complete our clinical trials may be delayed.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.400]   Aldera has no obligation to update these statements as circumstances change.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.400]   Future events and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the company's
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.080]   forward-looking statements including the current and potential future impact of the COVID-19
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.800]   pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial position.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.480]   No information concerning factors that could cause results differ materially from our forward-looking
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.040]   statements are described in greater detail and the company's press release issued this
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.800]   morning containing financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the company's
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.080]   filing with the SEC.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.800]   And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Todd Brady, our President and Chief Executive
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   Officer.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   Thank you Joshua and good morning everyone, as our industry and healthcare first responders
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.160]   continue working together to defeat the worst public health crisis in a century, our thoughts
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.200]   are with those affected by COVID-19.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.720]   The seemingly relentless spread of the novel coronavirus has made 2020 a tragic and surreal
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.200]   year but we remain hopeful and confident in the abilities of our industry to develop the
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.680]   therapies necessary to extinguish this virulent disease.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.640]   I again want to especially thank our team for their work and dedication to our mission developing
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.760]   first and class medicines to approve the lives of patients with immunological diseases whose
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.560]   conditions are not being adequately treated by the current standard of care.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.640]   From our perspective the key pipeline development to the second quarter was our Type C meeting
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.880]   with the FDA which charted the remaining clinical pathway to an NDA submission for topical ocular
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.640]   raproxalap in dry eye disease.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.080]   The meeting culminated in an agreement to use levels of reactive aldehyde species or RASP,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.640]   the therapeutic target for raproxalap as an objective sign in point for subsequent clinical
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.800]   evaluation.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.480]   In the fourth quarter of this year we plan to initiate clinical testing to assess the activity
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.200]   of topical ocular raproxalap in reducing tear levels of RASP and other objective signs of
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.800]   dry eye disease and we expect preliminary results by the end of the year.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.160]   The timing of the clinical trial is of course subject to finalization of trial design,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.720]   RASP assay development and potential disruptions due to COVID-19.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.320]   Initiation of a safety study in dry eye disease patients is also planned for the fourth quarter
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.000]   and NDA submission is expected by the end of 2021.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.280]   Our optimism for the use of RASP as an objective sign of dry eye disease is supported by data
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.600]   from our successful Phase 2A trial in which raproxalap treatment diminished levels of
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:10.000]   RASP and tears as measured by ELISA following 28 days of treatment.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.840]   For the upcoming RASP trials the longest duration of dosing under consideration is also 28 days
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.640]   whereas the shortest dosing duration is one to two days.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.280]   Additionally the upcoming RASP trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:34.240]   effect of acute changes in dryness on RASP and other signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.200]   We'll be sharing additional details of the protocol following RASP assay validation
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.280]   and FDA requirement and look forward to providing trial designs shortly.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.160]   From a safety perspective top collocular raproxalap already has been evaluated in more than 1,000
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.000]   patients with no observed safety concerns.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.760]   In short the safety consistency and clinically significant activity of raproxalap across
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.640]   numerous clinical trials suggests that raproxalap could be an important addition to the limited
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:15.240]   number of therapeutic options for dry eye disease which affects more than 30 million patients
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.240]   in the United States.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.720]   Looking at other ocular programs in our pipeline, top line results from the Phase 3 and Vigorate
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.560]   allergen chamber trial of raproxalap and allergic conjunctivitis are expected in the first half
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.440]   of 2021.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.760]   In the retinal disease area in the second quarter of this year the European Commission granted
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.840]   orphan medicinal product designation to ADX 2191 for the treatment of retinal detachment
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.440]   opening a new market opportunity for ADX 2191 and the European Union as drugs receiving
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.480]   the orphan medicinal product designation are eligible to protocol assistance, research
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.640]   funding and upon approval 10 years of EU market exclusivity.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:10.080]   ADX 2191 our novel and proprietary intra vitriol methotrexate injection is being evaluated in
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.720]   the Phase 3 guard trial for proliferative vitrioretinopathy.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.000]   PVR is a rare but site threatening condition and the leading cause of failure of retinal
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.240]   detachment surgery affecting roughly 4,000 patients per year in the United States and
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.760]   nearly twice as many in Europe and Japan combined.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.720]   Given the nature of PVR and given the clinical site delays caused by COVID-19 the progress
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.600]   of guard has been slow although we expect to provide you with an update by the end of
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   this year.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.640]   As many of you know there is no approved therapy for PVR and ADX 2191 has received orphan drug
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.040]   and fast track designations from the FDA.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:05.080]   ADX 2191 is also the subject of our new clinical program in primary vitrioretinal lymphoma or
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.920]   PVRL a rare aggressive high grade cancer that affects approximately 2,900 people in the
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.720]   United States with about 600 new cases diagnosed annually.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.840]   There are no approved treatments for the disease although the standard of care is pharmacy
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.720]   compounded methotrexate that has been injected into the eye.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:36.000]   We have recently filed for orphan drug designation for ADX 2191 in PVRL.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.320]   Turning to our systemic disease programs we are very excited about ADX 629 which to our
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.560]   knowledge is the first systemically available rasp inhibitor, the clinical testing of which
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.960]   represents the first time systemic rasp inhibition has been assessed clinically marking an exciting
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.120]   new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism of action.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.960]   An IND has been filed with the FDA for phase two clinical testing of ADX 629 in patients
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:15.440]   with COVID 19 in order to prevent cytokine release syndrome and respiratory compromise.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.040]   Clinical development is expected to begin this year.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:26.640]   In an animal model of cytokine storm ADX 629 demonstrated a broad and highly statistically
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.720]   significant reduction in cytokine levels including TNF alpha interferon gamma and IL 17 while
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.000]   upregulating the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.280]   The data suggests that rasp inhibitors have the potential to represent immunological switches
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:53.880]   which may modulate immune systems from pro-inflammatory states to anti-inflammatory states.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.440]   In the fourth quarter of this year we also expect to initiate clinical trials of ADX
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:06.120]   629 in psoriasis and autoimmune disease and atopic asthma and allergic disease.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.040]   In combination trials in COVID 19 psoriasis and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.680]   and the results of the trials will characterize the immune modulating activity of ADX 629
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.040]   and rasp inhibition more generally.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:32.080]   According to ADX 1612 our novel HSP90 inhibitor, enrollment has been completed in the investigator
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.000]   sponsored phase two Udario trial in ovarian cancer.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.600]   Regarding the ADX 1612 COVID 19 program consistent with FDA feedback additional preclinical antiviral
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:53.080]   testing of ADX 1612 against SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID 19 will be performed
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:59.000]   by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases which has accepted our request to evaluate
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.760]   ADX 1612 and in vivo models.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:12.960]   We plan to update on the ADX 1612 COVID program by the end of 2020.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.160]   We approach the midpoint of the third quarter in a strong financial position enhancing our
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.360]   flexibility with recent common stock sales to two healthcare focused funds perceptive
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.600]   advisors and identity partners.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:35.400]   These transactions raised growth proceeds of approximately 19.5 million completing our previously
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.160]   announced at the market offering program.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:45.880]   We expect our cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations through 2022 including potential
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:53.000]   reproxalap approval in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.440]   Now with that I'd like to turn the call back over to Josh for the financial review.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.440]   Thanks Todd.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.520]   For the quarter ended June 30, 2020 we reported a net loss of $7.5 million compared with a net
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:16.000]   loss of $13.3 million for the quarter ended June 30 2019.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.360]   Net loss per share was 25 cents for the quarter ended June 30 2020 compared with 49 cents for
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.520]   the same period in 2019.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.400]   Losses have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research and development programs
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.920]   as well as from general and administrative expenses.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:40.720]   Research and development expenses were $4.9 million for the quarter ended June 30 2020
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.080]   compared with $10.7 million for the same period in 2019.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:51.560]   The decrease of $5.8 million is primarily related to a reduction in clinical and preclinical
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.600]   development, manufacturing and personnel cost.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:02.200]   General and administrative expenses were $2.2 million for the quarter ended June 30 2020
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.040]   compared with $3.1 million for the same period in 2019.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:13.420]   The decrease of $900,000 is due to lower personnel related cost including stock based compensation
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.440]   and other miscellaneous administrative costs.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.480]   In the second quarter of 2020 total operating expenses were $7.1 million compared with total
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:30.440]   operating expenses of $13.7 million for the same period in 2019.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:39.040]   As of June 30 2020 cash equivalents and marketable securities were $66.2 million.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:46.840]   Subsequent to June 30 2020 $25.2 million in cash was received from at the market offering
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:54.680]   program sales to perceptive advisors, activity partners and other investors based on current
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:02.640]   operating plans cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30 2020 plus the additional
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:08.320]   at the market offering program proceeds are expected to be sufficient to fund operations
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:14.680]   through the end of 2022 including potential NDA approvals for reproxel app and dry disease
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:20.800]   and allergic conjunctivitis assuming positive clinical trial results and planned NDA submission
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:28.420]   acceptances and approvals use of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are also expected
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.960]   to include the continuation of part one of the phase three guard trial in PVR and phase two
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:42.200]   clinical testing of ADX 629 and orally administered rats inhibitor and inflammatory diseases.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:51.400]   Now turn the call back to Todd for closing comments.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:58.000]   Thanks Josh we have a number of milestones planned for the second half of 2020 and look forward
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.560]   to executing on our clinical development strategy across our ocular and systemic programs looking
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:10.840]   at our IR calendar next week we'll be presenting at the BTIG virtual biotechnology conference
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:17.600]   and wed bush pack row virtual health care conference these events will be webcast please check the
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.420]   events and presentation section of our website for details we always look forward to meeting
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:30.620]   with investors and hope to connect with you at these or other upcoming events as always
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.600]   we remain committed to executing efficiently in our strategic plan and bringing to market
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:41.220]   novel therapies that improve the lives of patients with serious unmet medical needs with that
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:46.760]   Josh Dave and I will be happy to take your questions operator at this time if you would
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.920]   like to ask a question please press star than the number one on your telephone key pad
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.100]   that is star one to ask a question for first question comes from the line of Louis and with
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:05.320]   hands or hi thanks for taking my questions here so first question I have for you is can
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.180]   you get into more detail on the significant the FDA's recognition of drafts as a sign for
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.560]   dry eye disease is and what that means for you in terms in terms of potential approval
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.600]   and market opportunity and then the second question I have for you is on your COVID trials how
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:25.040]   adaptive are those trials in light of the constantly evolving landscape for the treatment of COVID
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.760]   and then how enrollment gone and then my last question here is you noted that there's been
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.120]   some headwinds to clinical trials progression due to COVID can you give more color on which
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.480]   trials may be impacted here thank you.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:46.440]   Good morning Louise and thanks for your excellent questions the draft development is truly transformative
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:54.720]   for Aldera draft is the pharmaceutical target upon which the company was founded many years
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:05.480]   ago to our knowledge no company has ever therapeutically addressed rasps and yet rasps represent a very
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:11.640]   broad based anti-inflammatory approach that probably applies to many many diseases not
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:18.720]   only ocular diseases such as dry eye disease but also systemic diseases so for all those
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:26.260]   reasons we were thrilled about the FDA's decision to classify rasps as an objective sign of dry
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:32.120]   eye disease which as you know is an inflammatory condition.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:39.400]   What it means practically for the company is that the ongoing clinical trial the clinical
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:45.480]   trials that are about to start regarding the assessment of rasps should be likely to work
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:52.760]   based on the fact that the mechanism of reproxylapin our other rasp inhibitors is the direct inhibition
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:59.600]   of rasps these compounds bind covalently to rasps so what we're really measuring is a
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.680]   chemical reaction in vivo and in this case in the tear fluid of patients that have been
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:14.120]   administered reproxylapin all that leads us to believe that we'll be in a position to file
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:21.620]   an NDA for dry disease next year as we have previously announced.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:29.480]   Regarding the COVID trial design we anticipate for both programs enrolling approximately
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:36.800]   30 patients I think they'll likely be a two to one randomization drug to placebo at this
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:43.480]   point we have not included adaptive designs I think the nature of the results of these
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:49.200]   first trials will help us determine subsequent clinical testing which is obviously going to
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:56.260]   be much more significant if there are positive results from the preliminary outputs that we
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:02.680]   have here enrollment hasn't started the IND has been filed for 629 as I mentioned on the
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:13.880]   call today 1612 is the subject of further in vivo investigation in covid that is being
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:23.800]   performed by nyad and we're absolutely thrilled about nyad's decision to test adx 1612 on
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:32.200]   our behalf the covid impact as you mentioned we've across the industry has been significant
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:40.840]   the one trial in our case in our pipeline that has been affected by covid 19 as the guard
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   trial the phase three guard trial for PVR what seemed to have happened during the peak
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:57.220]   of covid cases back march april may and so forth was that many patients simply were not coming
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:08.040]   into the hospital despite vision changes despite losing sight the number of patients coming
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:16.240]   in was diminished during that time frame and furthermore many clinical sites as you know
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:22.560]   simply did not have research staff which were considered for a while to be non essential
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:30.680]   such that it was difficult if not impossible in some cases to enroll patients however the
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:37.000]   good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline we do not seem to be have been overtly affected
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.760]   by covid in terms of enrollment the dry eye program was largely under discussion with
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:51.640]   the FDA during the peak number of cases in the spring the allergy program the phase three
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:59.120]   allergy program was on a planned hold because of pollen as you know you cannot enroll allergy
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:05.360]   programs with ambient pollen and we expect the invigorate program to re-initiate again
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.120]   in the fall so we were quite fortunate in terms of timing with regard to our other clinical
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:21.040]   programs we relative to the impact of covid okay thank you
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.760]   and the reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star then the number
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:30.360]   one on your telephone keypad that is star one to ask a question or next question comes from
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:36.480]   the line of justing down with oppenheimer in company hi good morning guys thanks for taking
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.360]   the questions and congrats on the progress I know it's early days but you know as you
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.840]   think about establishing a prox alert action on rasp as a sign of dry eye we've had some
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.280]   discussion with the message on what would be an appropriate duration of observation
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.040]   to assess this activity can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.700]   acute versus four-week time points from a trial perspective disease perspective and labeling
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:08.840]   perspective right good morning Justin and good to hear from you see as I highlighted in
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:15.280]   my comments this morning the potential range of dosing duration for the rasp trials is anywhere
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:22.000]   from one to two days on the acute end to 28 days on the mark chronic or sub chronic end
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.560]   which reflects the phase two a trial that is the data in our corporate decks showing that
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:32.120]   after 28 days of administration of a prox lab there was a highly statistically significant
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:39.120]   reduction in rasp levels as measured by Eliza I want to spend a few seconds talking about
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:45.800]   the two different ways to measure rasp rasp exists in our body in two forms so-called
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:52.180]   free rasp that rasp that are sort of floating around and then rasp that are bound to proteins
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:23:00.240]   the Eliza measures rasp bound to proteins and as you know Eliza is an antibody mediated detection
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:06.860]   assay the reason why we're able to generate antibodies to bound rasp is that when rasp
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:15.000]   bind to proteins they're antigens and form antibodies in some cases antibodies against self proteins
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.100]   so the Eliza measures bound rasp and bound rasp generally accumulate over time which is why
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:28.160]   in the phase two a study over 28 days we use the Eliza to assess rasp levels on the other
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.960]   end of the spectrum regarding one to two day or acute dosing of her proxel app we think
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:42.760]   that techniques such as LC/MS might be more relevant to assessing rasp because there we'd
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:49.840]   be looking at free rasp levels that would change acutely following dosing so somewhere within
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:57.720]   those two ranges of dosing paradigms and those two different assay techniques we will end
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:06.800]   up validating the precise technique and then establishing protocol design for the first
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:15.320]   of the rasp studies to begin shortly okay great got it and maybe then you know how do you think
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:20.000]   about dosing regimens to be investigated and how you had conversations with the FDA on you
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.280]   know whether you'd have to do sort of you know QID or BID you know just to appreciate that
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:34.040]   you would be tapering and sort of the disease state eventually right and and that gets back
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:39.560]   to the first part of your question how might the clinical community perceive duration of
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:49.860]   dosing and dosing regimens first of all I think that signs of diseases including dry eye disease
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:58.000]   are primarily or first and foremost regulatory milestones I do not believe that certainly
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.080]   in the case of dry eye disease that either physicians or patients are particularly worried
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:11.160]   about signs patients do not wake up in the morning thinking I wonder what my Schermer test is
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:17.680]   I wonder what my corneal stain is and so forth instead we view signs and I think most patients
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:25.760]   and physicians use signs as regulatory milestones so the dosing paradigm for trials associated
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:33.560]   purely with signs I think is a lot less important in this case for one to two days one to two
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:40.160]   day dosing paradigm you're thinking of of a limited number of doses for the 28 day dosing
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:47.960]   paradigm I would expect we would dose QID which is the first phase of our induction maintenance
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:53.800]   dosing paradigm which was established with the release of the phase 3 renew trial back
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:02.640]   in December in terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm for reproxelap in general
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.240]   in terms of treating patients I think that the induction maintenance paradigm established
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:16.960]   with renew over 12 weeks really sets the tone and more precisely the label for how the drug
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:24.440]   will be used and that is a QID dosing initially followed by BID dosing for the maintenance
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:31.520]   phase okay that's really helpful maybe just a clarification question I know in the press
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:39.900]   it says that there's going to be a dry ND filing by the end of the next year is the current
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:44.520]   thinking still to continue on with the concurrent filing just you know I know later it says
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.500]   that AC is also going to be filed just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:56.480]   them together still our current thinking is that both will be filed together pending positive
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.720]   clinical data of course it turns out that the timelines for dry eye disease and allergic
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:11.080]   conjunctivitis continue to overlap the safety studies the efficacy studies the timeline for
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:18.920]   filing the mda all of those seem to overlap for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:25.840]   this point would suggest that a concurrent in DA is perhaps the best regulatory strategy
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:32.080]   but of course we'll have to see how events play out over the latter part of this year
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:38.520]   and the early part of next year before we can guide specifically on the possibility of a
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:45.160]   concurrent in DA we really do like the concurrent in DA paradigm however because of the overlap
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:52.000]   between dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis it seems to be about a 50% overlap such that
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.240]   about half the patients with dry eye disease complain of ocular itching and about half
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   the patients with allergic conjunctivitis complain of dryness and a single compound that could
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:08.160]   treat both diseases or is indicated for both diseases would be highly advantageous not
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:14.920]   only to physicians but also to patients as well right that makes a lot of sense my last
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:23.040]   question just you know on the safety study is there an expectation for what the size and
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.280]   scope you know duration as well as number of patients you would anticipate for it right
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:36.320]   for dry eye disease my current understanding is that the FDA generally requires 100 patients
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:47.280]   complete one year of dosing however based on other other sponsors interactions with the
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:54.960]   agency we believe that we can file based on six months of safety data so what happens is
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:01.040]   most sponsors will over enroll they'll begin with more than 100 patients such that they
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   have 100 completers at 12 months and to our knowledge the safety trials are fairly standard
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:21.800]   and dry eye disease I will say as I mentioned in my prepared comments that we've tested
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:28.840]   well over a thousand patients we have seen no safety signals no changes in intraocular
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:38.680]   pressure no retinal findings no aberrant corneal findings or any other safety signals that would
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:44.040]   suggest that there has been an issue with reprox flap dosing and any patient that's received
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:49.000]   drugs so far great thanks again and I'll hop back in the queue
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:06.400]   well thank you all again for joining us today as always we look forward to keeping you updated
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:20.120]   on our progress have a nice day thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude

[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.600]   Mr. Thielander, you may begin.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.780]   >> Thank you and welcome to our second quarter conference call.
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.920]   Before we get started I would like to remind you that today's call will contain forward
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.640]   looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.040]   and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.800]   Although management believes these statements are based on reasonable expectations,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.320]   they can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.600]   These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions as described
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.280]   in the earnings announcement we released yesterday and in our 2019 annual report
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.400]   on form 10K and subsequent quarterly filings.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.680]   These documents can be found in the investor section of our website www.herstoneenergy.com.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.560]   Should one or more of these risks materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.040]   actual results may vary materially.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.720]   This conference call also includes references to certain non-gap financial measures
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.800]   which include adjusted diluted shares, adjusted EBITDAX, adjusted net income, all in cash costs,
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.000]   cash GNA and pre-cash flow.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.800]   Reconciliations of these non-gap financial measures to the most directly comparable measure
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   under GAAP are contained in our earnings announcement released yesterday.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.920]   Also please note information on this call speaks only as of today, August 6th, 2020.

[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.400]   Today's call will begin with comments from Robert Anderson, our CEO,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.640]   followed by remarks from our CFO Mark Lumpkin regarding financial measures and financial matters
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.160]   and performance and then some closing comments from Robert.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.720]   I'll now turn the call over to Robert.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.280]   Thank you Scott and good morning everyone and appreciate everyone's attendance for our call today.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.760]   Thanks for making time to join us for our second quarter conference call.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.600]   In the midst of the current pandemic we continue to take appropriate caution and maintain focus
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.800]   on keeping our personnel safe while continuing to efficiently manage our operations.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.960]   Achieving our strong second quarter results in the face of this unprecedented oil price
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.120]   collapse and difficult operating environment is evidence of the resiliency of our business
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.480]   plan and the solid commitment of our people.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.240]   Throughout these trying times we have worked to quickly adjust to the rapidly changing conditions
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.440]   and align our costs with our business activity as well as preserve our strengths.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.160]   As we have discussed last quarter and in updates along the way stating we would be free cash flow
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.320]   positive from the second quarter on for 2020 we had significant free cash flow of $35 million
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.800]   in this quarter.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.960]   This was driven by several factors including limited capital expenditures in the quarter
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.880]   as we completed our drilling and completion program for the year.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   Strong hedge position that delivered over $29 million of realizations and significantly
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.720]   lower operating costs partially as a result of our May shut in and containment program
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.720]   but also sustainable reductions.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.840]   Including the impact of our shut in program our average daily sales volume in the second
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:34.200]   quarter was 13,555 barrels of oil equivalent or BOE per day even with reduced volumes
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.720]   and a 44% drop in average realized price for BOE in the second quarter our cost management
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.480]   efforts combined with the strong hedge position allowed us to generate higher quarter over
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.720]   quarter adjusted net income and adjusted EBITACs.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.040]   I suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.320]   We expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the balance of the year which
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   should result in a decreasing debt balance and help us achieve our target of being below
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.920]   one times debt to EBITACs for the year.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.640]   As we previously discussed in response to the sharp decline in oil prices in April and very
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.160]   low forecasted May oil prices we made the decision in late April to shut in the large majority
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.360]   of our operated production for the month of May which resulted in approximately 60% of
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.560]   our total net production being shut in during May with a forecasted significantly improved
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.200]   June oil prices which ultimately were more than double our April and May oil price realizations
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.280]   we returned to full production in June.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.200]   We had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions which saw us reduce total
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   lease operating expense or LOE in the second quarter by 40% from the prior quarter despite
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   reduced production volumes due to our shut in program in May our teams continued focused
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:08.560]   on cost reductions resulted in a 30% decrease in LOE per BOE in the second quarter to $4.53
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.400]   versus $6.51 cents in the first quarter.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.480]   This was the major driver of the overall 33% reduction in all in cash cost during the quarter.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:26.400]   On a per unit basis our all in cash cost went from near $13 per BOE in the first quarter
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.120]   to near $10 per BOE in the second quarter for a total 22% reduction.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.620]   This is all in cash cost folks which includes operating costs, corporate GNA costs and all
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.400]   of our interest costs on our debt.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.420]   To dive a little deeper into how we achieve the 40% decrease in LOE let me outline some
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.800]   of the key factors.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.960]   First as much of our peers have done we were successful in negotiating price reductions
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.080]   with vendors across the broad range of our lease operating expenses from chemicals to maintenance
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.520]   rigs, salt water disposal contracts and compression costs.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.120]   Second we are benefiting from our long term practice of spending a little more money as
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:17.480]   we go repairing wells, facilities and associated equipment to reduce frequency of maintenance
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.180]   which is resulting in a continued decrease in non-routine LOE repair needs.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:30.240]   Third workover repairs have trended down resulting from our optimization of Lyft method chemical
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.280]   program improvements and general approach of fixing things right the first time.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.960]   The limited offset frack activity also reduced frack hit related work over expenses.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.000]   Fourth we have been successful in getting the utility companies to perform electrical upgrades
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.720]   sooner than scheduled which has allowed us to eliminate generator usage on some of our
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.520]   newer locations.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.040]   Lastly with limited drilling and completion activity we have also been able to refocus
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:06.320]   our field employees towards lease maintenance which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.020]   All of these items and many other subtleties of operating were in progress as our team has
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.360]   a history of continually driving down costs.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.060]   We will remain focused on continuing to reduce cost across the board as we expect the oil
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:26.000]   price environment that we have observed since late 2014 including increased volatility
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.320]   to persist which only stresses the need to structure our business to be profitable across a much
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.360]   lower oil price range.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.280]   I'd really like to commend our operations team which did a fantastic job of both shutting
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.200]   in production in May and bringing production back fully online in June while also achieving
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.280]   these cost reductions.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.480]   For the first time in my career and our team's history we had to tell our guys to produce
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.780]   as little as possible every single day.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.720]   We executed this shut in operations and our field personnel did a great job of efficiently
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.360]   returning wells to production with little to no incremental expense and no adverse effects
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.000]   on our producers.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.120]   Our wells have returned to their previous volumes with some wells producing at increased rates
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.960]   for a period of time.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.320]   Plus the three wells in Southeast Reagan County that were brought online in April prior to
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.880]   the curtailment and were shut in during May are now back online and have fully cleaned
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.380]   up and are performing well versus the tide curve.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:34.440]   I mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in late May and released our contracted rig
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:40.320]   operating in the Midland Basin so our planned capital expenditures are minimal for the balance
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.000]   of the year given that our program ended with 11 wells drilled but not completed and with
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.840]   our ample liquidity we have optionality on completion timing depending on market conditions.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.560]   With production return to full capacity we have entered the second half of this year with
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.920]   expectations for no further drilling or completion activity this year.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.840]   We can maintain approximately flat year over year production in 2020 compared to 2019.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:14.000]   As a reminder we recently updated our 2020 full year production guidance ranging from 13,000
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:23.640]   to 14,000 BOE per day which compares to 2019 full year average of 13,429 BOE per day.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.720]   Further with our 11 drilled but uncompleted wells in Upton County we intend to carefully
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.440]   monitor commodity pricing appropriate service availability and service cost conditions
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.320]   to determine if it makes sense to bring in a completion crew later this year or wait until
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.600]   early next year.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.800]   Depending on the timing we anticipate the completion of those 11 wells would enable us to maintain
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:53.880]   similar year over year production for 2021 with only a modest capital program for the completions
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   which we currently estimate at around $30 million.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.680]   With that overview I'll now turn the call over to Mark to review the financials.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   Have at it Mark.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.680]   Thank you Robert.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.600]   As we have in the past two consecutive quarters I'd like to first discuss our cash position
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.080]   and our balance sheet, as Robert mentioned we are pleased to have achieved our goal of generating
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.880]   substantial pre-cash flow in the quarter with a total of $35.1 million of pre-cash flow.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.680]   As we represent our first quarter call our plan was first to reduce our working capital deficit
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.760]   which we calculate excluding derivatives and we're able to do this by over $50 million
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.080]   during the second quarter and then to begin to pay down our revolver debt.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.160]   The barn based under our Senior Secure Revolving Facility which was set in late March remains
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.200]   unchanged at $275 million and should remain there until our regularly scheduled fall redetermination
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   process.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.560]   Our outstanding bar rings under the credit facility at quarter ends hold $168.6 million and we
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.280]   had $1.8 million in cash.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.720]   With $106.4 million of unused barring capacity that gave us approximately $108 million of
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.520]   liquidity quarter ends.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.680]   I would note that as of July 31st we had paid down our revolver by $14.3 million compared
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:14.960]   to quarter end reducing our debt balance now to about $154.3 million and we did expect to
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:20.840]   apply pre-cash flow the remainder of the year primarily to pay down the revolver.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.400]   During the second quarter our capital expenditures settled $3.2 million and year to date we have
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   spent $45 million of our annual 2020 capital budget of $50 to $60 million.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.720]   As Robert mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in May so we anticipate minimal
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.280]   expenditures during the remainder of the year and will likely end up toward the low end
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.040]   of our guidance range.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.520]   Now looking at our second quarter income statement starting with the top line revenue for the
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:53.240]   second quarter of 2020 were $21.7 million compared to $45.1 million in the first quarter.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.640]   The decline was driven by a 54% decrease in oil revenues to $18.9 million which made up
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:05.080]   about 87% of total revenues and the NGL revenues fell by 44% while natural gas revenues rose
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.800]   slightly.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.560]   Our average price in the second quarter for all three commodities was $17.56 per barrel
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.480]   of oil equivalent which was down by nearly half of our average price during the first
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.480]   quarter.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.080]   By commodity our average price for crude oil in the second quarter was $23.56 per barrel
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:32.200]   natural gas average 83 cents per MCF and NGL average $8.10 per barrel of oil equivalent.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:38.880]   From a production standpoint our second quarter sales volumes average 13,555 barrels of oil
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:47.100]   equivalent per day which was comprised of 65% oil, 18% natural gas and 17% natural gas liquids.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.840]   As highlighted this does include having curtailed about 60% of total production in May.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.520]   On the expense side as Robert also highlighted we did drive down our all impact costs from
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.880]   $12.92 per BOE in the first quarter to $10.11 per BOE in the second quarter.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:09.900]   We achieved this through nearly $2 per BOE reduction in our lease operating expense to $4.52 per
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.200]   BOE for the quarter.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:18.000]   On the general administrative side we reduced our absolute cash GNA expense by about 7%
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.720]   versus the first quarter which resulted in per unit cash GNA expense of $3.34 per BOE.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.840]   As you know we reduced our cash GNA guidance in May to $15.5 to $16.5 million for the full
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.680]   year and expect to be somewhere in that range which at the bottom of the end is a 25% reduction
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.440]   versus our initial full year plan.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.320]   In addition to some of the savings we articulated last quarter we continue to focus on and have
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:50.960]   had success in reducing expenses really anywhere including reduced uses of third party consultants
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.080]   reducing vendor rates and managing our costs tightly.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   From an income standpoint we reported GAT net loss in the second quarter of $35.9 million
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:06.560]   or $55 cents per share which included a pre-taxed unrealized loss of $50 million on our derivative
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.560]   contracts.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:13.660]   Our adjusted net income was $12.8 million or $0.20 per BOE adjustability share for the second
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.660]   quarter.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.040]   We reported adjusted EVA tax of $39.8 million in the second quarter which as Robert mentioned
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.120]   is actually an increase quarter per quarter.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.280]   Now let's take a minute to update you on our commodity hedges results in the second quarter.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.480]   As highlighted we realized $29.4 million gain on our commodity hedges for the quarter.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.080]   This is largely reflective of our hedge position entering the quarter and unlocking in some
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.200]   really nice gains on hedges when we made the decision to Gerckel production and did that
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.760]   when second quarter NIMAC prices were about up to the lowest point.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:50.480]   The hedging realizations also include a gain of about $5.7 million from an unwind of 1,000
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.320]   barrels of oil a day for the second half of 2020.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.120]   We remain really well ahead for the balance of the year with an average of 6,500 barrels
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:05.220]   per day of oil swapped at an IMX price of $58.35 stepping down to 4,000 barrels a day for four
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:13.280]   year 2021 at an IMX price of $55.16 per barrel with basis hedges and places on similar volumes.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:20.440]   On the natural gas buy we have 7,000 MMBTU per day of swaps at a Henry hub price of $2.85
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:28.400]   for the second half of this year stepping up to 8,000 MMBTUs per day at a price of $2.71
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.880]   for full year 2021 with basis hedges in place on the same volumes.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.640]   Hedging remains a critical component of our financial strategy and we expect to continue
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:43.600]   layering on hedges as we get more visibility around the resumption of our drooling and completion
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.840]   activity going forward.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.960]   Stepping back and looking at our expectations for full year 2020 we reinstated our production
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.760]   guidance in July and we reinstated LOE in production and Advolorant tax guidance with our earnings
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.780]   released yesterday.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:04.960]   Our reinstated production advolorant tax guidance of 6.25% to 7.25% is identical to what it was
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.740]   at the onset of our 2020 guidance provided in January as is the case for our reinstated
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.560]   LOE guidance of $550 to $6 for BOE.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.960]   Although we have had recent sustainable LOE reductions and came in well below this range
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.820]   in the second quarter, without the advantage of bringing on new wells, we have kept our
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.160]   guidance range where it was at the end of the year when we anticipated bringing 16 new wells
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160]   online.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.640]   With that I'll turn it back over to Robert.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.320]   Thank you Mark.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.280]   We are really pleased with the results and confident in a bright future for Ergestone.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.680]   While we are sorry to see our industry in such distress, it is creating more MNA opportunities
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.520]   than we have seen in quite some time.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.460]   We are actively evaluating a number of situations and expect to have more to consider throughout
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.540]   the rest of the year as prices remain low and distress situations continue to increase.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.760]   We believe that our strong balance sheet and track record as a successful consolidator
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.520]   positions us well to increase the scale of our company and add value to our shareholders.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.760]   With that operator we'll now open the floor for questions.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.760]   Thank you.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.600]   At this time we'll be conducting a question and answer session.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.680]   If you'd like to ask a question please press start button on your telephone keypad.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.440]   A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.880]   You may press start two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.960]   For participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.320]   pressing the star key.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.040]   Our first question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.560]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.360]   Hi morning everyone.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.760]   Hope you're doing well.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.480]   I guess on the twenty twenty one color that you gave about being able to keep production
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:50.200]   flat with the eleven ducks is that more just meant to be instructive or is that actually
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:57.280]   how you're thinking about the twenty twenty one plan as we fit here today.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:06.520]   Yes a little bit of both Brad you know it does depend on where commodity prices head
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.840]   towards the end of the year whether we want to pick up a rig or not.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.160]   I think we've been pretty vocal or consistent about our message that you know we need we
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:21.200]   need mid forty five to fifty dollar oil to want to go back to spending large capital
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:28.240]   dollars but outside of that at some point into this year early next year completing those
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.560]   wells will allow us to main production flat year over year.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:41.080]   Okay and then obviously you made the comment on M&A can you go into a little more detail
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.640]   about sort of what opportunities you're seeing and also any thoughts you have about an ability
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.160]   to fund them.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:20:00.960]   The opportunities are increasing and sizes variable from small to quite large as you've seen you
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:10.040]   know distressed in bankrupt companies I think all of this will result in further opportunities
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.160]   in terms of larger company selling assets.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:23.160]   It is difficult with no public equity and for that matter debt markets open or open only
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:29.480]   to a very few maybe we're one of those few but we've had discussions with financial parties
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:35.000]   who are interested in participating with us on acquisitions and much like we've done in
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.700]   our history you know we'll bring in parties at the right time to look at buying assets
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:49.480]   and we're going to maintain a very healthy leverage amount and keep ourselves from getting
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:56.900]   into a distress no matter where we are in the cycle so I think we're just going to see more
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.880]   and more opportunities and we'll figure out how we can finance those and make sure we keep
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.520]   our balance sheet clean.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:09.280]   Okay thanks for the comment.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.280]   Thank you.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.000]   Our next question comes in line at Neil Dingman with Truist Securities.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.040]   Please proceed with your questions.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   Good morning all.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.600]   Robert the first question also on that same line on 21 expectations and I'm just wondering
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.640]   you know why I realized this plan really I think you know at least the ones you just initial
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.960]   laid out it seems no new wells really what I'm just wondering what's driving this low cost
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.920]   or another way maybe ask is how you think about maintenance capex you know given just
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.760]   so low because you know if I recall I thought Frank already had you all cancel those country
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.680]   club and other memberships I just know what else is there.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:55.600]   Yes there's no country club memberships up here you know I mean the 11 wells we have
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:02.680]   are in really good areas and they they will help us keep production relatively flat at
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:09.080]   30 million dollars now is that sustainable absolutely not you know we still have a relatively
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.720]   high decline rate and it does depend on when we brought those wells online if we waited
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:19.200]   till the very end of 21 we're going to have a hard time keeping production relatively
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:25.320]   flat if we brought them on today you know we might have the same problem because we get
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:33.460]   all this flush production from these new wells so you know maintenance to maintain you know
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:39.360]   13,000 BoE a day kind of level longer term we're going to have to have a rig running
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:45.840]   and a one rig program I don't know what it would exactly cost us today but generally speaking
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.640]   is 120 million to maybe 140 million depending on lateral length and working interest and
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.760]   things like that so you know this is just a very preliminary if the world stays the same
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:04.320]   and we're at 40ish low $40 environment we're not staying drilling capital these 11 ducks
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:11.120]   will help us keep production flat okay and then you kind of hit on my last one just on
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:17.860]   how do you think about sort of PDP decline you know on a go forward it is now that you've
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:24.080]   been slowing a bit is that that too you know going to go down or I guess look at another
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.480]   way is it you know you're able to give us kind of how many how many wells would offset that
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.320]   I mean in any way you can kind of give us a call around how you know kind of you're thinking
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:42.100]   about that in 21 on broader terms yeah I think we've been consistent in telling everyone
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:49.200]   that our sort of basic line starting today we'll call it you know is about 30% in the
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:56.640]   first year and then it gets into the mid maybe 26 or 27% the next year and then low 20s or
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:04.920]   high teens after that and so you know I don't think that's changed any and if we didn't spend
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:13.040]   any capital then you can kind of forecast what our low down production would look like
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.800]   even if we didn't do those 11 wells but again with those 11 wells it'll help keep 21 flat
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:25.820]   and then going forward in 22 and beyond it's all going to depend on price very good thanks
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:36.680]   thank you our next question comes from line of Jeff Graham with Northland Capital Markets
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:42.320]   please proceed with your question I guess I was wondering Robert or maybe Mark how important
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.560]   you guys do you think precast flow positive in the context of evaluating you know whether
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:52.040]   to go after this deduction and potentially drilling or I guess some point in time but would
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:57.560]   you view that as kind of a you know a must if you will or would you guys having level
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.400]   of comfort with any you know near medium term outstanding it could help you know if the
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.420]   returns were good and it would help kind of you know jumpstart a return to growth sure maybe
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:13.440]   I'll try to answer that one then Robert can add on if he wants to you know we keep things
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:19.200]   pretty simple at the end of the day we feel like our responsibility is to make good individual
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:26.380]   decisions at the wellhead and that's why we were quick to put the rig down and stop completing
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:31.040]   and March and April is because the economics didn't make a whole lot of sense then did
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.680]   the ducks make sense right now I mean economically you definitely could go complete the ducks
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:42.920]   right now and have pretty nice IRR's for the incremental cost to complete them in terms
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:49.340]   of are we so focused on quarter to quarter year to year precast flow that we won't outspend
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:55.040]   no we're not and from a practical matter and we're just going to be precast positive this
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.320]   year and next year kind of irrespective of anything else that happens with prices if all
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:06.000]   we're doing is completing the ducks at some point you know we do anticipate picking the
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.520]   rig back up and you know there's a bit of it obviously a lag there between the cost you
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.800]   expend to drill in the complete wells versus the cash flow you know does that mean over
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:22.440]   the course of the year we're not precast positive no not necessarily but we're not so fixated
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:29.440]   on checking that box every quarter we want to make smart economic decisions the wellhead
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.480]   that will flow into the bigger picture and having some outspend for some period of time you know
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:42.080]   we still think is supported by the economics at the same time you know we're not ones just
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.840]   to go keep drilling and completing because we have hedges in place or for other reasons
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.360]   we're just trying to be as good a stewards of the can of the individual decisions we're
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.760]   making at the wellhead yeah the only thing I'll add Jeff is I think we can run a one rig
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:04.880]   program with the level of production and cash flow we have today and be cash flow neutral
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.920]   on an annualized basis yeah obviously there's a jump starting the program we're going to
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:17.080]   be cash flow negative for a period of time but I think longer term over a year time frame
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:25.000]   again depending on what the price is sure understood appreciate those comments and my followup and
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.920]   you guys still have you know a decent amount of nonoff exposure in the Permian are you guys
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:38.040]   getting any activity levels there and more on the land side there any traction or conversations
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:45.320]   on swapping any of that out to increase the operation exposure there still working on
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.840]   the trades but people have been hunkered down in the bunker you know for quite some time
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:28:00.400]   now since you know at least March and so nothing's moving very quickly there we have no we have
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:09.000]   not heard anything different from our partners in terms of activity in the near term being
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.560]   kind of the remainder of this year so we'll have to see as we get closer to year end what
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:24.880]   their view might be for activity in 2021 alright thank you our next question comes from line
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:34.840]   of Duncan Macintosh with Johnson right please receive your question I had a quick question
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.240]   overall on the balance sheet y'all doing great job in the free cash outlook looks great paying
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.480]   it down wondering you know if you've been in conversations with the bank as we head into
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.360]   the fall redetermination back in March you know we're early and getting it done in the spring
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.120]   but you know back in back then it looked like things would be pretty dire again in the fall
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.920]   and it's not as bad here and particularly with the line of sight y'all have on the free cash
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:03.060]   kind of how any conversations then to give me any indication as to what the fall redetermination
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:09.320]   could look like sure I've been probably too early to you know certainly anything around
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.600]   numbers but we do pretty rarely talk to banks and we do that normal course irrespective of
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.200]   the environment you know the one thing I can for us we are expecting a decrease in the
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.200]   bar base and you know obviously we're not drilling and completing new wells and hedges roll off
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.760]   you know fortunately we feel like we've got enough ability to pay down debt to outpace
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:37.140]   that decrease and really you know we don't see any scenarios that we think are realistic
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:42.920]   that would be concerning in that regard now I will say like does the environment feel better
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:49.280]   now than it did three months ago absolutely and maybe some of that's the shock of seeing
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:58.760]   in minus 37 hour oil and you know teen realizations for the months of April and May at the end
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.520]   of the day it's still not a very good price environment for companies in general and the
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:13.080]   banks maybe they feel a little better because we're at $45 or $42 versus somewhere in teens
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.880]   but they still have a lot of issues to deal through to deal with it and obviously there's
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:24.160]   been a lot of EMP companies that have gone bankrupt and there's certainly more that will so the
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.560]   banks still have their hands full and they're still working through all these situations
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:34.800]   yeah I think there is a lot of trepidation from the banks part in general and yeah I don't
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:40.560]   frankly see them letting up a whole bunch in the fall no that being said that's a general
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:48.040]   statement yeah we've got one time leverage and liquidity and generally are viewed as having
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:55.360]   done the right thing from a financial standpoint and our assets are better than than many we
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:02.580]   probably feel like we've got a pretty supportive bank group that is going to be reasonable and
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:09.880]   fair and historically that's been the case but too early to circle the number thanks Mark
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:15.080]   and then I guess just for my follow-up you know Robert you get some some really good color
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:20.840]   on in order some pretty creative things to get LoE down in the second quarter I know you
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.680]   talked about how it's going to come back up a little bit here in the back half of the year
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.360]   towards you know a more historical range but you know any of those initiatives that you
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:37.620]   took do you think that you could carry forward to kind of help mitigate that LoE creep definitely
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:45.120]   done there's there's you know it's just a constant progression of a well life cycle to adjust artificial
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:54.080]   list a lot of our wells are on gas lift so relatively expensive compressors over time
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.540]   that gets changed out to other lift methods in some cases rod pump and other cases plunger
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:06.800]   lift what have you so we're continuing to work through that and that will definitely help
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.520]   reduce LoE and then some of the things that you know we we were fortunate in getting done
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:19.320]   in the quarter working with the utility company to get meter set and get ahead of the schedule
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:25.700]   there or got moved up in the schedule from some good relationships we we ended up getting
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:31.320]   generators off of our payroll and those are very very expensive so we didn't have a whole
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.520]   lot but they still show up as a big expense so some of these things we did in the second
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.600]   quarter are sustainable and we'll continue doing the right things and the way we you
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   know operate our business and continue to watch costs like a hawk all right thank y'all
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:55.640]   very much and I grab some strong quarter and a strong outlook thank you next time thank
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.480]   you ladies and gentlemen as reminder if you'd like to join the question queue please press
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.400]   star one on your telephone keypad our next question comes from a line of Noel Parks with
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:15.220]   coca and Palmer please proceed with your question hey good morning I know I you know I was thinking
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:21.240]   about the having the back inventory that you know where it works out that just completing
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:28.200]   those next year giving can help you keep production flat that's you know that's a lot of really
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:37.720]   great flexibility you have there and I mean was that just sort of a result of the the timing
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:45.000]   of everything you know kind of fall off the rails with with COVID and overt Russia or
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   or was that was that sort of part of the plan as you were just trying to you know continue
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.520]   the pivot to represent free cash flow hitting it next year I'd love to tell you know that
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:05.980]   we have this great plan that no matter what happened in the world oil going to 20 or sub
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:13.000]   20 that we could keep production flat for three years running with various amounts of capital
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.920]   if you go back and think about the beginning of the year and the call we had you know related
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:26.160]   to the fourth quarter earnings and full year we had a one rate program we were going to
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:32.760]   average for the entire year a tiny bit of free cash flow and those 11 wells would have been
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:40.240]   completed I don't know if by now I can't remember but pretty darn close so I'd say it's a fall
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:49.180]   out of what's happened here and just being very conservative with our capital expenditures
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:57.520]   and cash and making sure that you know we come out of this down this near term downs cycle
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:03.640]   we've been in a down cycle since 2014 but at least this recent piece of it that we you
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:10.300]   know we survived nicely through it and come out the other side and continue to find ways
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:18.040]   to consolidate and grow great thanks and you know just a housekeeping question so if you
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:24.980]   touched on this earlier and I missed it for the free cash flow calculation if I looked
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:29.180]   at the numbers right it looked like this is one of those periods where there is a pretty
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:38.160]   big delta between I used to say cash capex and you know sort of capex incurred in the quarter
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:47.660]   and I was just wondering for the free cash flow calculation going forward there's just
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:54.760]   kind of which which one of those is more important for us to use as we you know just try to model
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:04.080]   that we always use a crude cash from a calculation standpoint because not all the bills necessarily
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:11.600]   have hit but we know what generally they are so okay it's in the presentation on the last
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:19.840]   page or something like that okay so so real oh and one other thing I am and I just don't
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:25.640]   have a release in front of me and as far as changing working capital you definitely also
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:33.360]   you would routinely include well include the impact of in a free cash calculation or would
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:40.800]   you exclude that yeah so we don't include that and recognize there's you know multiple different
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:46.560]   ways to look at that I mean the way we've been approaching it is okay adjusted EBIT Act
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   is the best proxy for your really sort of cash flow for the period we back out interest
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:59.320]   expense and then we back out capital expenditures for activity during that period now when you're
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:04.680]   stopping or starting there is going to be a bigger delta between right escalating free
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:12.040]   cash flow the way we do versus if you're using a cash capex number you know the second quarter
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:19.440]   was very typical from the standpoint of here we're reporting 35 million of free cash flow
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:25.760]   yeah our debt balance went up and the reason for that is because and of course this is tied
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.400]   to the cash capex it's just the time of the payments yeah we reduced the negative working
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.800]   capital deficit by about 50 million during the quarter now we're to a point where that
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:42.400]   working deficit working capital deficit is pretty low and probably won't fluctuate a whole bunch
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:50.520]   one way or the other until we pick activity back up at which point you'd expect you start
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.400]   completions and drill in again you start getting bills but there's some lag between the activity
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:00.480]   and when you get the bills and when you pay them so very typical quarter yeah as we mentioned
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.880]   the press release you know we had about 169 million of debt at quarter end and the month
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:11.240]   of July we paid down a little more than 14 that's not the the run rate by the way it's
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:17.000]   not 14 million quarter that was high because of timing but we do expect I mean really every
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.640]   month this year that we're paying down some debt without any big changes in the working
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:32.040]   capital status great thanks a lot for the details that's not for me thank you ladies and gentlemen
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.600]   that concludes our question and answer session I'll turn the floor back to mr. Anderson
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:43.240]   for any final comments we appreciate everybody joining us and you know we'll continue to update
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:50.400]   as as we need to and we'll see you next quarter thanks thank you this concludes today's conference
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.440]   you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.100]   you

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   Good day and welcome to the Ferns 2nd Quarter 2020 Financial Results and Corporate Update
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.440]   Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. As a reminder, today's
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.560]   conference is being recorded. I'll now like to introduce you, your host for today's conference,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.840]   Alexander Furzeekeuzius, Head of Investor Relations at Ferns. Please go ahead.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.760]   Thank you, Charlotte. I'd like to welcome and thank you all for joining us today for
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.360]   Affimate's 2nd Quarter 2020 Financial Results and Operational Progress Conference Call.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.960]   Before we begin, I would like to encourage everyone to go to the Investor Relations section
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.240]   of Affimate's website to find the earnings release and related financial tables.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.440]   We also post the slides on our website that follow our discussion today.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.920]   On the call today, we are joined by Drs. Adi Herz, our Chief Executive Officer,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.240]   Andreas Hartstrick, Chief Medical Officer, Arnst Satellius, Chief Scientific Officer,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.360]   and Angus Smith, our new Chief Financial Officer who joined us in July. We are also joined by Dr.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   Wolfgang Fischer, our Chief Operating Officer, and Ms. Denise Miller, Chief Business Officer.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.520]   They will also be available for the Q&A session. Before we start, I will quickly go through
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.600]   the safe harbor statement. Today's discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.200]   regarding future events. These statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.600]   as of the date of this call. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.440]   forward-looking statements publicly or to update the reasons why actual results could differ
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.360]   materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statement even if new information
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.080]   becomes available in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.600]   to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those expressed
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.240]   or implied in these statements due to various factors including but not limited to those
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.320]   identified under the section entitled risk factors and our filings with the SEC and those
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.440]   identified under the section entitled forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.520]   today and filed with the SEC. With that, I will turn the call over to Adi. Adi?
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.480]   Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.680]   business update call. Today we have some updates to share with you on our operational progress
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.600]   as well as on our financial results. While we're still in the middle of a serious global health
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.640]   pandemic and a challenging economic downturn and aftermath, we're quite confident that the steps
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.880]   we're taking in advancing our science and moving our pipeline forward are beginning to yield data
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.560]   that demonstrate the long-term potential of our innovative approaches and products.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.320]   COVID-19 continues to affect societies around the world and we hope that you and your families
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.600]   are well and safe. We are observing some impact by COVID-19 on the progress of our clinical
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.160]   studies. However, it's at last and we're taking great efforts to minimize them. As a result,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.760]   we have been able to continue our progress on the clinical studies of AFM-13 in the referral
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:46.880]   TESA lymphoma and of AFM-24 in each AFR positive tumors. And, which is very exciting for us,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:57.600]   genetic dose, the first patient with RO729708, which, as you remember, is the BCMA CT-168
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.960]   in a cell engagement. We're also making good progress on our pre-clinical pipeline.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.720]   For our lead candidate AFM-13, our study in patients who have relapsed or refractory
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.200]   peripheral TESA lymphoma in exhausted available standard of care treatments
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.400]   are now being treated with AFM-13 as a single agent. We are executing according to our development
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.480]   timelines and, as previously stated, expect to complete the pre-determined interim analysis
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:37.600]   in mid 2021. We're also looking at options to enhance AFM-13's efficacy beyond monotherapy.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.440]   The first of these options is the combination with allergen egg and K cells in a study
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:52.400]   that is conducted at the MD Anderson cancer institute under IST. MD Anderson website now
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.520]   shows that the study is enrolling, but the initiation is impacted by the ongoing COVID-19
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.840]   pandemic in Texas. A first patient in the study is expected as soon as this situation improves.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:14.160]   For AFM-24, we disclosed that we have completed the first cohort of our dose escalation study
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.720]   without any dose limiting toxicities and we're currently recruiting into the second dose cohort.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.760]   We have all four planned sites active and recruiting. Following the completion of the
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.800]   dose escalation phase of the study, we have the option to enroll patients into tumor specific
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.720]   expansion cohorts where we will look for single agent activity in the number of well-defined
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.200]   tumor types. In addition, we're planning to initiate combination studies with checkpoint
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.880]   inhibitors and we will be providing updates as the program continues to make progress.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.320]   Very pleased with the continued progress in our collaboration with Genantic. Importantly,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.200]   the phase one clinical study with the BCMA CG16A inertial engager is now enrolling patients.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:12.080]   This achievement represents the third inertial engager to enter the clinic and trigger some
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.680]   milestone payment to us during the third quarter in an amount that we're not able to disclose.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.520]   Last month, Angus Smith joined us as chief financial officer. Angus will introduce himself
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.640]   later and discuss our financial position and the flexibility provides us to continue to execute
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.360]   on our strategy and drive future growth of our company. During the annual general meeting of
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.080]   shareholders, which was held in August four, we are happy to report that all proposed agenda
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.800]   items were approved. This includes the addition of Dr. Annalisa Jenkins and Harry Welton to the
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:00.320]   Supervisor Report as new members. Annalisa is a visionary leader who knows how to translate signs
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.720]   from bench to bedside and Harry is an accomplished financial executive who will help drive value
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.320]   creating strategies for the company. These additions to the Supervisor Report further strengthen
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:20.960]   the company's industry knowhow, experience and diversity. As it has only been a month and a half
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.760]   since we last spoke to you, we thought we would focus today's discussion on company achievements
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.600]   thus far and what gives us confidence in our science. Update you on our programs and allow
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.680]   plenty of time for Q&A. To get it, I will now hand over the call to Andreas Horstreich, our
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.000]   Chief Medical Officer to give you a brief update on our clinical stage programs. Andreas?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.280]   Yeah, thank you Adi for the introduction and thank you all for joining us today and I'm happy
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:00.000]   to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs that we made over the last
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.800]   three months. As you all aware, COVID-19 pandemic is still present globally
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:14.080]   and it continues to pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment of patients.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:22.880]   The two guiding principles we are employing at AFIMED is to ensure patient safety on the studies
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:29.920]   and to ensure trial data integrity and this is in line, I think, with our guidances given
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:36.400]   from all competent authorities. Within this framework, however, the AFIMED team is very
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:44.800]   proactively working with all of our participating sites to make sure that our innovative treatment
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:52.640]   is still available for patients in need of new therapeutics and that we minimize the impact
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:09:00.080]   of COVID-19 to a minimum possible. One important achievement in this regard is that we were able
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.480]   to secure drug supply for all of our ongoing studies and can ensure uninterrupted treatment
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:15.200]   of all patients. To go into more detail, let's start with AFM13, our most advanced program first.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:26.400]   As you know, AFM13 is in a registration directed phase two study AFM13202 treating patients with
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:33.200]   relapsed and refractory peripheral T cell lymphomas who have exhausted all available
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:42.160]   standard of care options. The enrollment into the study is at a steady state. We were able
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:51.280]   to activate 54 sites now contributing patients in 10 countries around the globe. As you know,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:10:00.880]   the study has a Simon II stage design with a pre-planned interim analysis after 40 patients
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.640]   in the PTCL cohorts and as Adi said, we are confident that we will have the data from this
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:15.760]   interim analysis available by the mid of next year. There was also a third cohort or there is
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:22.800]   a third cohort in this study for patients with transformed mucosis fungidus, so a cutaneous
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:30.400]   form of T cell lymphomas. This third cohort with mucosis fungidus was never part and never intended
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:38.800]   to be part of the registration program. It was a proof of concept cohort only and for COVID-19
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:46.480]   related restrictions, the enrollment into this cohort is currently on hold. As Adi also mentioned,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.600]   we are continuing to make progress in our collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:11:00.960]   where we have an active IND for our first phase one study of AFM 13 in combination with allogeneic
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:09.600]   national killer cells. As Adi said, the current status at the MD Anderson webpage is recruiting
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:16.960]   and we know that patients are currently screened and considered and we are expecting to
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:24.320]   the enrollment of the first patient as soon as COVID-19 related restrictions at MD Anderson lift up.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:35.120]   Now let's move to our second program AFM 24. As you know, by specific tetravalent molecule targeting
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:43.200]   both CD16A to activate national killer cells and macrophages and the EGF receptor on solid tumors.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:53.520]   This compound is in a phase one dose escalation part of the 101 study and we are happy to report
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:00.240]   that we were able to activate all four preplanned sites and all four preplanned sites are contributing
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.720]   patients. As we disclosed earlier, we have completed cohort one without observing dose
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:18.880]   limiting toxicities and are actively recruiting into dose cohort two. With this, I close the
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:26.480]   overview of the clinical progress and I'm happy to hand over to my colleague, Archotelius Chief
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:33.680]   Scientific Officer who will review with you some of our preclinical data that make us so excited
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:40.000]   about the opportunities that we can create for patients with ICEs and activating the innate
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.600]   immune system. Archotelius Chief Scientific Officer Thank you, Andreas and thank you all for joining.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.520]   In the next few minutes, I would like to summarize as Andreas mentioned the preclinical
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:01.360]   and clinical data observed so far with our innate cell engagers providing evidence that these molecules
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:11.120]   are potent and safe drug candidates. I'll start by summarizing the data showing that our ICEs
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:21.280]   are potent molecules. As you see on slide five, if we take AFM 13 as an example, AFM 13 has been shown
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:29.520]   strong single agent anti-tumor responses and T cell informa with a normal response rate of 50%.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.840]   The molecule has also shown promising signs of broad clinical development potential in augmenting
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:45.120]   other IO therapies such as PD1 inhibitors. For example, in the Hodgkin lymphoma phase 1B study,
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   we've seen an impressive overall response rate of 88% with a complete response rate of 42%
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:03.040]   and 46% in the local and the central read respectively. In the low part of the slide, we've also highlighted
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:12.320]   for you presentations of the studies past and in the future. Additionally, our own experience
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:19.440]   and the work with Andy Anderson, we have seen promising preclinical data showing that the
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:26.080]   combination with the adoptive transfer of NK cells enhanced the immune response of AFM 13
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:33.520]   leading to prolonged survival in the respective mouse model. And as we mentioned, the phase 1B
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:43.280]   study and the Anderson is now in the last stages of preparation. If we go to slide six, you see
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:51.600]   that in our preclinical studies with AFM 24, we saw potent killing of EGFR positive tumor cell lines
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:15:00.720]   mediated by two distinctive mechanisms of action. Potent ADCC or antibody dependent cellular
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   cytotoxicity is seen irrespective of the imitational status of the tumor cells.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   And we see potent killing mediated by ADCP or antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:26.000]   in tumor cells with high and low EGFR expression. Importantly in cells bearing the KRAS G13D mutation
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.520]   AFM 24 shows preserved killing, potent killing or ADCP or phagocytosis
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:41.600]   whereas this ability is lost for established treatments for the anti-BCMA
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:52.640]   CD16 or RO729 formerly known as AFM 26 molecule. We also saw very good potency in synomunkies
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:16:01.200]   whereas a dose dependent killing of BCMA positive plasma cells was observed.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:08.880]   We believe that the observed improved potency is mediated by the dual mode of action
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:15.120]   of our approach. The innate cell engagers are employing NK cells and macrophages
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:23.280]   to kill tumor cells and thus act via a two-pronged mode of action of antibody dependent cellular
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:31.440]   cytotoxicity and antibody dependent phagocytosis to fight cancer. Indeed, this dual mode of action
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.760]   is differentiated from other innate cell targeted approaches as these specifically activate NK cells
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:49.280]   only. Our innate cell engagers work at low expression levels. The potency is thus independent
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:58.640]   of the surface target expression and you see this in continuing slide six. With AFM 13 we learned
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:05.200]   that there is a broad range of cell lines that express different levels of tumor antigen and we
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:11.040]   have not observed any dependency of target expression to the potency of the molecule.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:19.840]   The same holds true for AFM 24 and the anti-BCMA engagers. Preclinically both molecules have
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:29.280]   shown high potency across a wide range of EGFR and BCMA surface expression including at low target
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:36.800]   expression levels. This implies that more patients could respond to treatment with an innate cell
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:45.360]   engager versus an antibody drug conjugate or ADC as the mechanism of ADCs have been shown
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.720]   only to rely on certain levels of target antigen thereby missing those terms cells
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.840]   with expression levels below the ability of the ADC to bind two target cells.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:07.280]   As we move on to slide seven and report on the safety front, preclinically our innate
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:16.320]   cell engagers demonstrate low cytokine release. Some examples of this are the indenabling toxicology
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:23.600]   study in cinemologous monkeys which consistently showed no meaningful increases in serum cytokines.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:32.560]   For example at the June virtual ACR conference a preclinical poster presentation on the RO729 molecule
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:39.840]   with genetic showed potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing NK cells as effector cells
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:47.120]   with minimal increase in cytokines. Also a four-week safety study in cinemonkeys showed
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.680]   a favorable safety profile with no cytokine release or adverse findings at the 1515
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:04.000]   and 50 so 50 mixed per kick tested dose levels and in the case of AF in 24 only a transient
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.600]   increase in RO6 was observed that was fully reversible within 24 hours but no signs of
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.920]   cytokine release was observed that would lead one to believe that there is a risk of a cytokine
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:25.760]   storm in patients. Important to note here is that none of the clinical studies of AFM 13 have
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:32.960]   revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines. These data indicate that our ICs
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:41.360]   have a tolerable and good safety profile. Taken all together these data suggest that our innate
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:48.720]   cell engagers are potent able to engage at low levels of antigen expression and have thus far
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:56.400]   demonstrated a good and tolerable safety profile. Now in order to maximize the opportunity for our
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:02.720]   molecules in addition to clinical development as monotherapies we're also pursuing combinations
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.960]   with natural killer cells and other treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors such as PD1 and PDL1.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:17.280]   We go to slide 8 and first let me comment on our combination approach with NK cells.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:24.880]   As you see on the slide there is evidence showing that high NK cell numbers are associated with
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:32.240]   better outcomes. For example patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma have improved survival rates
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:40.000]   if their tumors show evidence of NK cell infiltration. We also know that patients with
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:49.600]   diffuse large B cell and follicular lymphomas treated with NDCD20 antibodies that have low peripheral
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:58.800]   NK counts tend to have poor survival. We're seeing that one of the limitations in treating patients
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:08.160]   is that they don't have the appropriate amount of NK cells so we're working on supplementing NK cells
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:16.320]   through adoptive transfer and are currently assessing different approaches as you can see on slide 9.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:25.040]   As we go to slide 10 and as discussed earlier the improved tumor cell killing by
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:32.560]   loading NK cells with our ICEs as you see on the graph for in vitro data on the right hand side
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:40.560]   of slide 10. It will be investigated in the MD Anderson phase 1 study in CD30 positive recurrent
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.600]   or refractor Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The preclinical data that we share here and
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:54.560]   I've shared before leads us to believe that we can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:04.880]   of innate cell engager AFM13 through the addition of NK cells and encouraged by the synergistic
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:13.520]   potential of combining our ICEs with NK cells and checkpoint inhibitors we're currently evaluating
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:22.480]   the opportunity on our developing clinical plans for these combinations with AFM24. Finally let me
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:30.880]   just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at ASER. As a reminder our AFM24 poster demonstrated
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:38.400]   its distinct mechanism of action different from other EGFR signaling inhibition approaches
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:46.880]   potentially able to provide benefit to a broad range of cancer patients and in the case of the
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   joint poster with genetic the preclinical pharmacology and safety of the BCMA CD60NA
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:01.040]   innate cell engager shows potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing NK cells as affect
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:07.760]   your cells minimal increase in cytokines suggesting a low risk of cytokine release syndrome.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:16.160]   We hope this background was helpful for you and I will now turn the call over to Angus to introduce
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:23.840]   himself and provide an upstate on the financials. Thanks. Thank you Angus. Thank you Angus. Before I
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:31.280]   discuss financial highlights let me just say that I am thrilled to have been doing that and I look
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.000]   forward to working with our talent to deliver on the promise of our exciting cytokines.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.800]   Turning to the results for the quarter ApiMed consolidated financial statements have been
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:49.920]   prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the international accounting standard board for IASB.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:56.240]   The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros which is the company's functional and
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:02.640]   presentation currency therefore all financial numbers that I will present in this call unless
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:10.000]   otherwise noted will be in euros. We ended the second quarter with cash cash equivalents
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.880]   and current financial assets of 92.6 million euros compared to 104.1 million euros
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:24.080]   on December 31st 2019. During the quarter we received net proceeds of approximately 20.8
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.560]   million euros under our asset market for ATM program. Based on our current operating plan
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:36.800]   and assumptions we anticipate that our cash cash equivalents and current financial assets
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:43.760]   will support operations into the first half of 2022. Net cash use and operating activities for the
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:50.880]   quarter ended June 30th 2020 was 15 million euros compared to 5.6 million euros in the second quarter
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.600]   of 2019. The second quarter 2019 net cash use and operating activities included a milestone
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:04.560]   payment to the company from the German Tech Collaboration. Total revenue for the second quarter
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:10.400]   of 2020 was 2.9 million euros compared with 4 million euros in the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:17.360]   Revenue in 2020 and 2019 predominantly relates to the Genentech Collaboration. Revenue from the
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.080]   Genentech Collaboration in the second quarter 2020 was comprised of revenue recognized for
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:29.200]   collaborative research services performed during the quarter. R&D expenses for the second quarter
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:36.000]   of 2020 were 11.7 million euros compared to 11.5 million euros in the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.480]   Expenses in 2020 relate predominantly to our AFM 13 and AFM 24 clinical programs
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.320]   as well as to our early stage development and discovery activities.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:54.240]   G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 2.6 million euros compared to 2.3 million euros
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:01.120]   in the second quarter of 2019. The increase is primarily related to higher SOX compliance costs,
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:07.840]   legal consulting and audit costs. Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was 12.2 million euros
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:15.840]   or 16 cents per common share of 10.3 million euros or 17 cents per common share during the second
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:22.960]   quarter of 2019. The weighted number of common shares outstanding for the quarter ended June 30th 2020
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:28.000]   were 79.2 million. I will now turn the call back to Adi. Adi?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:38.720]   Thank you Angus. As you can see from our presentation today, we're taking advantage of
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.880]   the knowledge that we've gained in the field of innate immunity and are applying it to our
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:51.760]   programs going forward. This experience in working with the innate immune system is
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:59.040]   something that we have uniquely established at AFMET and is helping us in guiding the design
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:06.080]   of unique therapies which now have the potential to address very different kinds of cancers.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:13.200]   I just want to point out here that the EGFR is expressed in more than 10 tumors
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:20.480]   and that gives us a lot of optionality how to take this molecule forward.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.960]   We're pleased with how things are moving forward for both our clinical and preclinical programs,
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:35.280]   especially in the current environment. Our preclinical programs are in track AFM 13 and 24 are
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:41.360]   moving forward according to plan and genetic is moving things forward with the anti-BCMA
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:50.480]   CD6NA in ESL engagement. What are our inflection points for the next one and a half years for AFM 13?
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:59.120]   We've mentioned that we want to present the interim data in peripheral T cell lymphoma
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:07.760]   around middle of next year. We've been successful in our collaboration with MD Anderson moving
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:16.960]   forward the combination of AFM 13 and co-plug derived natural killer cells. As we said we're
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.000]   ready to start or MD Anderson is ready to start and we hope to report first patient then and we
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.640]   will provide updates as we move forward. For AFM 24 we're in the midst of dose escalation
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:38.080]   in order to generate safety and activity data. This is quite exciting for us because it's
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:47.440]   drug with a very differentiated profile as compared to the other moieties currently used in targeting
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:55.280]   EGF receptor. Now with the dose escalation and establishing the safety we obviously
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:01.120]   will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the dose cohort expansion
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:08.320]   but as we've mentioned earlier is also planning early on to move forward into combinations.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:16.880]   We're very happy with the progress in the genetic collaboration. We've just provided the next update
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:23.440]   for the BCMA CD6NA in-gager. We have multiple other programs ongoing and if things go well pending
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:31.440]   on program progression we can bring in additional milestones and for our newest additions to the
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:41.360]   pipeline with AFM 28 and AFM 32 we're starting behind enabling studies so that we can have
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:49.520]   an ID filing first for AFM 28. Finally before we open the session for Q&A I would like to thank
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:55.600]   all our employees for their contribution and express our gratitude, my gratitude in particular
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:02.800]   for our investigators and the clinical sites, the patients and all their families and our investors
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:08.080]   who are supporting us in our efforts to develop these innovative treatments for cancer patients.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:15.840]   It is through the combined efforts of all of you that keeps us on the path of discovery and
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:23.120]   innovation. I'm now happy to close the presentation and we're open now for questions. Thank you.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.000]   Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.400]   as a reminder should you wish to ask a question. You will be depressed far in the number one
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.880]   in the telephone ring for an immediate answer. If you wish to cancel it and depress the pound
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:43.600]   or hash key. Once again it's far in one for questions. First question comes from the line
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.400]   of Malia Rakoff from Jeff Freese. Go ahead. Here line is now open.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:54.320]   Hi good morning everyone. That's on the progress and thanks for taking my questions.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:01.520]   To start off just wondering for AFM 24 I'm not sure how much you can say on this but just
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:07.040]   wondering if both patients in core two have been dosed and if you can talk more
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:13.360]   about the timing of dosing between patients and what the foresight activated can you
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:19.680]   provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward. Andrea can you take the question
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   please. Yeah so there were multiple parts of the questions I hope I got them all so the phase one
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:37.040]   study of AFM 24 as we said we are recruiting into second cohort we have not yet disclosed how many
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:46.800]   patients as you know it's a standard three by three design with a Bayesian dose modification
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:55.200]   but that's basically what it is. In terms of timing between the patients there is a mandatory
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:02.560]   eight day waiting period between patients so they cannot be treated all at the same time but will
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:10.240]   be staggered with eight day intervals and there was another part of the question around the
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.880]   four participating sites. Right yeah I'm just wondering if you can provide any more perspective
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:25.200]   about enrollment pace going forward. Currently the enrollment pace is as pre-spressified by the
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:32.640]   protocols also all sites are very active in screening patients and as we said all sites have
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:43.360]   already contributed patients. Got it okay great and then also for AFM 24 just checking if you
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.640]   can say more about the tumor types that you're screening for the study and if you can also
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.680]   provide more perspective into the checkpoint inhibitor and combo plans at this point.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:06.560]   So for the tumor types in the dose escalation part we are accepting all our patients with
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:14.880]   or all histologies that our EJFR are expressing and whereas a patient has exhausted the respective
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:22.160]   standard of care treatments. As Adi mentioned this is a wide variety of potential tumors
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:28.640]   probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal cancer and non small cell lung cancer
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:35.360]   and these are the two histologies where we would expect probably the majority of patients in the
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:44.160]   phase one having said that the dose escalation part would also be open for other EJFR expressing
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:52.080]   tumors like for example head and neck cancer gastric cancer or other solid tumors. Now once
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:58.880]   we have defined our dose limiting toxicities or if there are no dose limiting toxicities we have
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:06.560]   defined the recommended phase two dose we will enroll into tumor specific expansion cohorts
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:15.280]   and these expansion cohorts are currently in the process of being defined. Now for our PD1
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:24.720]   combination plans based on the interesting data we have seen with PD1 in combination with AFM 13
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:32.160]   which aren't referred to with a very encouraging complete response rate in excess of 40 percent
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:41.760]   we plan to have a combination with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor open rather soon probably
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:49.600]   in parallel to the last cohorts of the dose escalation of the single agent study so it will
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.520]   be more or less a parallel development that we are anticipating right now.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.120]   Great okay thanks for the additional perspective.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:15.520]   Any follow-up questions? We will now proceed to the next question. The next question comes from
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:21.040]   the line of Jim Breschenoff from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead Jim.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:28.480]   Yeah hi guys like congrats on all the progress maybe just a first quick question for Angus
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:34.960]   to start him off collaborative research revenues is that expected to be a stable number
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.000]   between the you know three to four million dollar level or is there any reason that might
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.320]   go up as programs progress and as we think about the milestone that got paid in the third quarter
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.840]   is it a simple matter to back out the assumptions around collaborative research revenues and
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   that will give us some sense of the milestone I'll give him that you can't say it explicitly.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:03.040]   Yeah yeah thanks Jim for the question so you know our our revenue numbers fluctuate from quarter
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:08.000]   to quarter you know based primarily on the number of hours that we're that we're working on the
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.760]   various genetic programs that are in progress I mean you can see just looking back at the last
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:20.000]   several quarters we've been you know fairly fairly range range bound and call it the 2 million to
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.680]   5 million zone you know when you see increases it's typically a result of quant and time milestone
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   payments that we receive so you know this this milestone payments that we discussed today
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:37.600]   that will that we'll get in the third quarter will likely increase our revenue in the third
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.840]   quarter and that would be sort of an add-on to the to the range you've seen over the last several
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.960]   quarters of that again kind of to the two to five million dollars two or two to five million euros
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:55.520]   rather got it okay that's that's helpful and then maybe just on cohort one for AFM 24 and what we
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:02.240]   might learn from that cohort can you remind us if you're doing pre and post biopsies and
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.440]   what kind of translational work you might be doing and you know how that might inform you
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:16.880]   know the ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:27.440]   we do a pre treatment biopsy post or untreatment biopsies are optional we do have a significant
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:35.040]   correlative science program looking at peripheral activation markers of nk cells as well as on
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:43.520]   cytokine profiles once we are in the expansion phase so we are recruiting into tumor specific
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:49.200]   cohorts i think this is the part where we will get most of the correlative science as we have
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:56.560]   a more homogeneous patient population we maintain our requirement for a pre treatment biopsy
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.760]   and we'll have post or untreatment biopsies in selected cohorts
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:10.720]   and then just you know given the comments on the variability and peripheral nk cell
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:21.440]   populations is there any sense in screening patients for their nk cell levels given that you
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:28.400]   know patients who screen low may not have adequate nk cells or macrophages to recruit or you feel
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.920]   like within the variability of an eight cell um in the blood that that you'll be able to
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:40.320]   have an effective treatment and it's not worth screening for that variable uh i think currently
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:47.840]   it would be uh premature to yeah depends on what you mean with screening so we are definitely
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:54.240]   determining the uh levels of circulating nk cells and also looking at some of their characteristics
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:02.560]   i think we currently do not have enough data to define a cutoff or a threshold
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:08.960]   and this may very well vary between uh tumor histologies and also be dependent on
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:16.800]   the infiltration of nk cells in the tumor micro environment uh variable which we have seen
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:24.320]   in our afm columbia study to have some impact on on the likelihood to respond to patient of
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:32.400]   patients so think in the beginning of the program we will be open for all comers we will assess all
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:38.640]   of these important biomarkers and then based on the activity data and the readouts that we are seeing
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:45.040]   we may modify as a program defining certain thresholds but currently i think it would be
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:52.320]   premature to do that and maybe just a final question just um the ambie anderson collaboration
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:59.920]   is focused on cord blood derived um nk cells is there any thought to other nk cell sources
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:07.120]   including um potentially ipsc derived nk cells um
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.760]   adi you want to take this question or should i take it no well i under why don't you go ahead
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:23.600]   okay uh yeah you're right ring cord blood derived nk cells is one source of nk cells and
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:34.960]   if you watch the field of nk cell um based approaches especially the the field around companies
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:42.800]   and institutes are providing different sources of nk cells there is definitely uh speed picking
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:50.560]   up and then there is a variety of options to to look at and this is what we do um not only from
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:41:01.200]   our side but we have also received proactive inquiries of potential working models together so
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:07.360]   we are looking at the entire nk cell field and then evaluate various options there
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:14.160]   great thanks for taking the question guys maybe as a quick comment so we see this um
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:20.560]   cord blood derived nk cells already quite advanced in clinical development so there have
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:28.640]   already been many patients treated while with the ipsc is currently there is still a the safety
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:34.160]   to be determined and obviously in combination we will learn more on their functionalities
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:42.080]   so this is somewhat uh yet uh to us on how functional an itc derived versus a peripheral
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:48.880]   in k cell is and it's good to see the first clinic data so we're quite uh not only happy but we've
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.600]   we've checked so many different options at the moment for nk cells and we're indeed very convinced
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:00.640]   about the activity of the cord blood derived cells from MD Anderson great thanks adi
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:11.760]   thank you for our next question comes from the line of iog from BMO capital the line is now open
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:18.960]   please go ahead hey good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my question this is ek on
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:26.640]   for doe kim uh just a couple regarding the BCMA and they engage her uh i understand that you
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:34.720]   have limited visibility on the entirety of the clinical bill pathway um but if you can provide
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:43.760]   any type of insight in terms of what genetic uh kind of has planned in terms of could it potentially
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:55.360]   pursue an accelerated pathway for the assets and secondly again you don't provide uh complete
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:00.960]   details on the exact milestone payments but if you can provide it some additional perspective on
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:10.720]   what the future milestones uh put asset might hold um in terms of uh you know phase two phase
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.240]   three things of that sort should we expect increasing size of value for each milestone
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:23.680]   payments uh that'd be helpful for us thanks adi maybe i take the question on the pathway and
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:31.680]   then hand over to you with the milestones yes please go ahead aunt so we are thanks for the
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:37.680]   question i mean as you already correctly say we cannot really speak in detail for genetic
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:44.080]   but we can share with you i think you're aware of course um licensing this molecule was a big
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:51.680]   part of the deal we did with genetic they're obviously excited about the strong differentiation
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:57.840]   potential of the molecule also demonstrated at ACR at the at the poster just to review again
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:04.800]   a very strong uh preclinical cell killing selective nosautica and release very good safety profile
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:13.440]   and good pharmacodynamic marker specific bcma plasma cell killing in the sino monkey so you know
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:20.640]   despite the also recent approvals of the you know income first encumbers in the space
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:28.400]   i would say that genetic shares are excitement with the differentiation potential
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:34.880]   in the way for a potentially best in class molecule maybe i i leave it there i think it's it's a
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:43.520]   it's a clearly um strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule will enable
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:49.840]   genetic and we as their partner to you know have a strong position in the space
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.640]   yeah regarding the financials so i just want to recall the deal uh when it was signed so we
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:07.360]   received 96 million in upfront cash and i uh and can get the total of more than five billion
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:14.640]   in milestones that are in different categories so there are a pre-tunnel mark there's a pre-tunnel
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:21.920]   milestone payment there are indeed multiple clinical milestone payments regulatory and cells
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:30.240]   milestones and on top we can receive royalties which as we described are on the higher end of
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:39.760]   what you would expect for the early nature of the license agreement beyond that we're not able
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:47.600]   to disclose any further details unless genetic would allow us or rush would allow us to do so
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:54.720]   usually and that's just a general statement is that the payments will increase the further
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:00.880]   the program progresses okay thank you for that and just one more quick question
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:08.480]   i think i might have misheard it this is in regards to AFM 24 i believe you mentioned that there was
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:17.600]   a patient uh that had increased in alpha 6 fiber kind levels that would resolve over 24 hours i'm
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:23.200]   just curious was that self resolving or did that patient receive and uh alpha 6 inhibitor
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:30.720]   yeah i can thanks for bringing that up and clarification so the transient alpha 6 increase
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:39.440]   was reported in the iron enabling synotox study what you you referring to the acr poster indeed we
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:46.560]   saw that with the dosing a kind of moderate peak that quickly went down was completely resolved
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:53.600]   without any any treatment obviously you know one doesn't do that in the because this is synotox study
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.240]   and again when we see this in the context because it was transient and fully reversed
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.520]   leads us to the conclusion which of course will be looked at carefully in patients
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:12.400]   that we should not expect any kind of cytokine release uh syndrome okay thank you for that
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:22.240]   clarification sure thank you next question comes from the line of gen from made in your company
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:32.960]   please go ahead the line is now open hello yes hello yes hi can hear you hi sorry that's
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:40.880]   my headsets fall out thanks for taking the questions my first question is that for the AFM 13
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:51.040]   in the for the registration study that the it's assignment two set up so what might be
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:59.360]   the threshold of ORR in the 40 patient and sort of internet readout before you can move forward so
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:03.360]   just curious what any information you can reveal on that front
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:13.440]   um i'm afraid we cannot give um a concrete response rate it's based also on the Bayesian design so
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:20.080]   there are some interdependence of response rates but we usually do not disclose thresholds but it's
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:31.120]   a classical simon two stage design okay no problem and also just curious in terms of AFM 24 that
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:40.240]   you are those escalating but at least based on the animal data is any thoughts where when you
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:49.200]   might start to see the potential effective dose to start i think currently it's not possible
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:58.000]   to predict when we will have the optimal biologically active dose um as there are a number of covariance
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:07.680]   like binding sites for cd16 binding sites for egfr and then distribution um and as you know the
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:13.760]   the animal models especially in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are very
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:21.440]   difficult to translate um the relevant talk species and after all that's only a talk
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:27.920]   species is the synomorgous monkey however we do not have any synomorgous monkey
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:35.040]   tumor models available so we cannot really bridge between what we see in the toxicology studies
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:42.240]   and then what we would see in terms of efficacy for for tumors so it will be something that we
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:50.800]   will have to define in our in our clinical program okay great maybe what sticking one last one last
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:59.440]   question here is that uh uh in terms of adaptive uh in case cell uh from the poplar uh not deriving
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:07.440]   case cells uh it first of all could that be potentially used in sort of tumor and any comments
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.520]   comments in terms of uh regarding that uh but uh part 30 uh this is as adi said
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:23.840]   something that we are actively looking into um we're starting out with lymphomas obviously
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:32.560]   with afm 13 targeting cd 30 but our vision is uh that also for afm 24 we will develop
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:40.560]   certain development options in combination with nk cells uh could be cord blood derived
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:46.560]   in case cells could be nk cells from another source uh that is something that we will define but
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:53.520]   the intention is also to to have a have a program where afm 24 would be partnered with
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:51:02.800]   exogenous nk cells okay great thanks uh appreciate it and congrats for another progress this far
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:16.320]   for the question at this time for any closing remarks please go out speakers um yeah thank
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:25.200]   you again for uh listening in and uh following our our updates um the uh the program is coming
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:32.160]   smoothly along despite that we are affected by uh by covid uh we have strengthened the team
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:38.640]   significantly in order to address any issues that may relate to the conductance of this clinical
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:46.480]   trials or uh to the uh interactions with the with the specific uh sites so we're very happy
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:53.280]   to be able to have been able to address any of the issues that have been arising and i indeed
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:52:01.040]   want to thank again uh the entire team here at afimet for managing all that through this difficult
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:08.960]   times uh we're quite excited uh that we can move forward uh these programs either as monotherapies
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:15.280]   and now looking at the different options of of combination as you've heard we focus on
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:22.160]   natural killer cells and checkpoint inhibitors in particular pd1 so pd1 so we feel that we have
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:28.880]   with the multiple programs addressing different targets we can provide a cadence of data over
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:36.960]   the next quarters and in years and uh very happy to report any additional updates as we move along
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:44.960]   thanks a lot again for listening in and uh all the best goodbye thank you for participating
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   in the august connect see you everyone thank you

[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.080]   I would like to turn the conference over to Dana Muinoto, Head of Investor Relations
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.220]   for Peer Grims Pride. Please go ahead sir.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.500]   Good morning and thank you for joining us today as we are operating in financial results for
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.060]   the third quarter ended September 27th 2020. Yesterday afternoon we issued a press release
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.480]   providing an overview of our financial performance for the quarter including a reconciliation of
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.320]   any non-gap measures we may discuss. The copy of the release is available in the Investor
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.880]   Relations section of our website along with the slides we will reference during this call.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.140]   These items have also been followed as aid case and are available online at www.scc.gov.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.060]   Presenting to you today our Fabio Sondri, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.960]   Mental Officer in Joe Wolbuzer at Commodity Risk Management.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.000]   Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to remind everyone of our safe harbor
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.040]   disclaimer. Today's call contains certain forward looking statements that represent
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.160]   our outlook and current expectations as of the day of this release.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.380]   Other additional factors not anticipated by management may cause actual results to defer
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.120]   material from those projected in these forward looking statements.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.480]   Very information concerning those factors has been provided in today's press release of
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.920]   NK in our regular filings with the SEC. I'd now like to turn the call over to Fabio Sondri.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480]   Thank you Dana. Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us today.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.280]   On the third quarter of 2020 we reported net revenues of $3.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:32.680]   of $305 million or 9.9% margin, 18% higher than a year ago and adjusted GAP EPS of 66 cents.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.760]   I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our global team for their continuing commitment,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.800]   dedication and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.200]   healthy by maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.440]   time. I could not be more proud of our team as they have continued to come together to
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.860]   support one another, our customers and consumers.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.480]   Faith is a condition of importance and our team members responded admirably to the unprecedented
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.560]   conditions, supplying products to our customers. We are continuously adapting our global operations
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.960]   to the change in channel demand while adjusting our operations to be able to maintain the
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.480]   operations at all our plans and minimize any significant disruption due to labor and health
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.700]   issues. We remain diligent in implementing precautionary, proactive steps to better safeguard the wellness
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.040]   and help of each team member while fulfilling our spatial duty as a food producer to consumers
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.520]   in every region where we operate. We incurred direct COVID-19 mitigation costs of roughly
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.720]   $27 million for the quarter and close to $77 million year to date. The direct costs are
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.520]   related to the extra cleaning of our production and common areas. The extra PPE and E including
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.640]   masks and face shoes that we are providing to all of our team members and the installation
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.700]   of physical barriers in our production areas. We also installed dual technology UV and bipolar
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.600]   ionization in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses. We are
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.720]   offering free life health online services that allow for virtual doctor visits and no cost
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.880]   and above all CDC guidelines. We removed vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.720]   benefits during community outbreaks. These figures include indirect costs there are more there
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.360]   are a lot of indirect costs there are more difficult to precisely quantify such as overall
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.680]   disruptions for operations less optimal mix and production efficiencies that are not included
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.520]   in these numbers. Also we are supporting communities with our home strong initiative. It is an example
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.040]   of how we value the importance role with playing the communities where our team members live
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.280]   and work. We understand the responsibility that comes with being a major employer in rural
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.600]   communities and it worked hard to contribute to the well being of those communities by not
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.120]   only providing game for employing opportunities but also participating in volunteers donation
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.400]   and sponsorship opportunities. This quarter we include $50 million in SCNA for this initiative.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.880]   Then to the specifics of our business despite continuing volatility and challenging marketing
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.000]   environments in Q3 and added operating costs we have continued to generate a superior relative
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.200]   performance to the competition and have remained resilient to market fluctuations. This is a
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.760]   reflection of our portfolio approach including the strategy on well diversified products
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.400]   broad geographical footprints and the relentless focus on key customers. For the full quarter
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.040]   operating performance both in US and Mexico significantly improved sequentially and Europe
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.500]   also continue to increase despite the challenges due to COVID-19. In Q3 we saw market conditions
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.120]   continue to recover across all of our global operations with the US and particularly Mexico
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.660]   experiencing the struggle rebound in performance relative to weak conditions during the first
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.920]   half of the year. We are pleased with the results especially when taking into account all the
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.600]   disruptions less than optimal product mix and added operating costs when compared to the
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.760]   environment in 2019. Despite continuing challenges in global market conditions due to COVID-19
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.160]   our consolidated results have also remained well balanced and the result of our vision
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.320]   to become the best and most respected company creating the opportunity for a better future
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.040]   for our team members. To support our vision we are continuing to implement our strategy
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.680]   of developing a unique portfolio diverse complementary business models. Continuing to relentless
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.720]   pursue operational excellence becoming a more value partner with key customers and creating
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.200]   an informed environment for safe people safe products and healthy attitudes. While market
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.000]   conditions in all our global operations are continue to improve during the quarter food
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.260]   service demand globally still has not reached prior levels and the environments are still
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.800]   quite challenging some sectors where we operate disruptions from COVID-19 have continued to
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.960]   present a significant challenge on each individual country's demand for protein consumption as
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:12.440]   well as for the flow of global trades and generate volatility far beyond normal seasonal factors.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.960]   We maintain our strategy will continue to improve the portfolio to better respond to individual
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.720]   market dynamics and generate a relative increase in performance over our peers. We believe this
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.120]   approach will give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to long run and minimize
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.840]   the full peaks and troughs of the commodity sectors. During the third quarter in the U.S.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.680]   we are continuing to see demand recovered at our fresh operations including from some sectors
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.840]   within food service with more states gradually losing travel and movement restrictions. Q and
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.120]   style volume has been especially strong and demand from our customers has been outperforming
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.160]   the industry. Similar to last quarter commodity large bird reboning was also again the most
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   challenge during Q3. Operationally however we continue to improve our relative performance
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.560]   versus the industry across all business units. We are continuing to adapt to the shipping
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.080]   channel demand by increasing our volume mix to key customer retailers. In addition, a
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.280]   large portion of our food service customers are also within the Q and style segment which
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.480]   has further dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models. Our portfolio of
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.880]   differentiated products along with our key customer model are giving us better installation
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.800]   against the volatility. We are also much better positioned to adjust products and channel
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:40.640]   mix even our presence across all bird sizes from small to large. Within those small birds
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.320]   and keys ready segments, market supply and demand was again very well balanced during Q3. Demand
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.200]   from retailers especially from our key customers was strong supporting improving performance
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.120]   of our keys ready business. Our market leadership in these categories and more differentiated
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.280]   product portfolio have continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive adventure versus
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:07.880]   the industry. While we commit to our key customer strategy has been reflected in the consistency
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.500]   for past results the value of this approach has never been more relevant to our growth than
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.560]   during the current times of great uncertainties and challenges. To further support the growth
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.960]   of key customers we are doubling our case ready capacity at our plant in Minnesota by increasing
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.240]   the number of heads processed at the plant while also raising the mix of more stable
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.720]   margin case ready products. With this addition we also expect to increase by 20% our production
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.840]   of our differentiated higher attributes just bear brand products. It is also supporting
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:46.120]   our conversion of one plant from the commoditized large bird deboning to a key customer QSR
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.680]   in the small bird segment. The strong relationships we have with key customers are giving us many
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.640]   opportunities to sustain our volume increase since this customer rely on us to satisfy
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.080]   their needs for growth. In addition many of our key customers maintain a leadership position
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.400]   in their respective categories. As a result we are direct beneficiaries of their ability
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.600]   to outgrow their competition. Beyond writing pure growth our key customer strategy also
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.920]   promotes trust enhances long term relationships and strengthen our margin structure. In the
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:26.240]   US prepare foods business revenue declined 23% on 26% less volume year over year. A large
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:32.680]   part of this decrease 70% of the volume was driven by schools remaining close partially
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:38.280]   upset by strength in the retail demand. On the other hand our margin from sales have improved
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:45.040]   29% driven by more favorable price and mix. We continue to simplify our portfolio to improve
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:52.000]   efficiencies and shift resources towards branded growth in the retail channel. Our pilgrims brand
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.440]   sales grew 52% and our just bear brand gained a new distribution resulting in dollar share
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:05.240]   growth in the retail channel. 32 code storage data at the end of August broiler inventory
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:11.840]   was up 2% from the close of Q2 but down 1% from the previous year. Like quarter inventories
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.040]   were up 10% compared to last year. This is not surprising considering the mixed simplification
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.320]   and doing to ongoing labor constraints seen during Q3 and overall lack of worldwide financial
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.360]   liquidity as a result of COVID 19. As some markets reopened and the pipelines are empty we are
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.240]   seeing some increasing leg quarter sales during October and our reduction in inventories
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:41.120]   and upward movement in prices. US poultry exports including pause were up 4.7% year over year
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:49.320]   throughout August. Ruller meat alone was up 3%. In contrast through Q3 our exports have
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.200]   increased by 14% year over year outpace in the market. China continues to be a significant
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.960]   growth driver and we believe the impact of ASF in South East Asia and now Germany can provide
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.360]   further support to export demand. As we approach the one year anniversary of China reopening
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.880]   to US poultry, producers are presented with a vastly different market landscape than a year
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.040]   ago. China has solidified itself as one of the largest export destinations for poultry
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.480]   second only to Mexico. China's present as a significant buyer keeps diversification of
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:31.080]   our export portfolio a high priority. We have added 95 new direct clients in 2020 and have
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.160]   also continued to diversify our product and destination mix. Sales of non-traditional
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:43.120]   export items are up 30% year over year which strengthens the cutout margin. We enter Q4
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:49.040]   with Optimus as we continue to place commodity items efficiently, leverage pilgrims overall
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.160]   portfolio diversity and prioritize exceptional customer service to meet the needs of our
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.440]   key customers around the world. After a very challenging first half in 2020 our Mexican
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.760]   operations delivered great results in Q3 and we recorded one of the strongest Q3 in the
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:10.760]   company's history despite the favorable mix impacted and added operation cost relative
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.480]   to the same period last year. More normalized economic activities and improved supply demand
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.160]   balance in the market are increased share of non commodity products and a very good operation
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.440]   of performance all contributed to the results. Although overall demand is improving we remain
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.640]   agile and are continuing to adapt our facilities by shifting production to those channels that
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.640]   our experienced better relative demand. The persons in Mexico explained some challenges
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.280]   especially in the value categories due to less traffic on retail combined with a contraction
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.240]   in the QSR volume but he began to see some signs of improvements towards the end of the quarter
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.920]   and we believe the positive trend can be sustained into Q4. We remain committed in low-term growth
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.080]   and demand prospects in Mexico we are continuing to invest in all the idea and premium pilgrims
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:05.560]   brand both in fresh and in prepared as well as seeing more market share in the modern channel
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:11.560]   which will bring more stable margins to our operations. Our European chicken operations
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:18.640]   delivered in Libet in Q3 that was 13% sequentially above Q2 with both volumes and revenue 7%
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.240]   and 18% higher respectively supported by our exposure to retail and continues recovering
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:31.080]   food service and QSR demand in particular. Relative to Q3 of 2019 Libet was still higher
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:38.720]   2% despite 8% lower volume and 5% lower revenue. In the evening of COVID-19 restrictions the
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:44.280]   introduction of UK government incentive directs towards food service as well as a consistent
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.640]   improvement in food service demand within continental Europe have all contributed to a better sequentially
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:56.280]   improved performance versus the prior party. They still have not yet reached prior levels.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.460]   Even during this challenging time we continue to be relentless in investing in innovation
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:06.240]   delivering labor and new improvements, driving better efficiencies, managing our cost base
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.520]   and offsetting cost increases to lean manufacturing techniques and capital investments around automation
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.760]   and process flow without sacrifices the health and well-being of our team members which remains
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.840]   a priority. We are committed to delivering the safest work environment possible and improving
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:28.600]   the quality of our products while achieving our sustainability agenda and bird welfare targets.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.400]   Our relative performance to the industry measure as the result of the last 12 months continues
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.720]   to show us improving and are pacing the average of the competition in Europe. For the next
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.500]   quarter we expect further improvements coming from the food service and QSR segments as
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:48.300]   these segments adapt to the situation in each country and we remain vigilant and prepared
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:54.320]   to react and adapt in case market conditions change. The performance of our nearly acquired
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:00.200]   European pork operations has continued to improve with EBITDA on an upward momentum. We have
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.240]   now been profitable on an EBITDA basis for the last six quarters in a row with margins also
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.280]   increasing on a consistent basis. The improvement in performance was driven by robust demand
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.640]   at retail partially offset by reduction in food service. Continuous strength in pork exports
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:21.920]   especially to China as well as the implementation of operation improvements and capture of synergies.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.680]   Exports to China remain strong in Europe 100% in Q3. Also exports to China have doubled as
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.360]   a percentage of our total pork sales and we expect demands from China continue to drive
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:39.800]   and strengthen our overall exports in the near future. All of our European fresh pork facilities
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.920]   are approved to export from China so we are well positioned to benefit from those opportunities.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.920]   We also continue to evolve in our strategy and we will significantly increase our volumes
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:57.640]   with a new key customer in the next quarters. Integration of the assets is on track to expectations.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.880]   Over the next few years we expect to generate an EBITDA improvement to achieve a level
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.120]   that is competitive with leading companies with similar portfolio. We have expanded our distribution
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.520]   capability for the newly acquired European assets through some recent wins to increase our retail
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.000]   exposure and strengthen our partnership with key customers. We are optimistic about building
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.480]   upon our operation improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint, extract
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.800]   best in class operational excellence, capitalize export to goods, optimize the portfolio of
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.600]   channels, segments and products as well as strengthening our growth business with key
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.880]   customers to drive innovation in value added and higher margin errors. We have a great team
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:46.760]   in Europe dedicated to generating the best possible relative results by focusing on factors
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:52.120]   within our control while ensuring protecting the safety and health of our team members.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:58.240]   Point prices has been rising since August driven higher by the combination of stronger than
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:05.320]   expected export demand and smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the US. USDA is projecting
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:12.280]   new crop ending stocks at 2.17 billion bushels versus 1.99 billion last year, which includes
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:19.760]   a 550 million bushels increase in export demand. The current corn crop is projected at 14.7
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:25.560]   billion bushels, the highest in four years and over 1 billion bushels larger than last
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:31.000]   year. Although corn prices have risen from the lows we saw in August, prices are very similar
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.400]   to where they were this time last year. Soybean prices have also risen since August driven
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:44.820]   higher by larger than expected export demand, primarily to China. USDA is projecting the
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.780]   current soybean crop at 4.3 billion bushels, up over 700 million from last year. Despite
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:56.760]   the large increase in production, USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 290 million bushels,
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.080]   the lowest level in four years. The uncertainty over the size of the Chinese import program
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.840]   is causing increasing uncertainty and volatility in the oil seeds market globally. Wheat prices
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.280]   in Europe has also risen recently despite the larger than expected Russian wheat crop and
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.600]   projected increased supply in other major wheat exporters like Australia. A slow start to
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:24.120]   the planting season in Russia and larger than expected export demand out of the US are contributed
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.680]   to the rise prices in the wheat market. On the chicken production, according to the USDA,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:36.200]   Q3 was down half of a percent relative to Q3 2019. As increased live weights did not offset
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.520]   head count reductions. The industry continues to maintain a larger layer flock with current
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:47.840]   levels 4.4 percent above last year, in line with the trends observed in Q1X3. The industry
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.720]   has also managed to reduce the average age of laying hands, promoting a younger, more
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.760]   efficient breed. This has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to manage supply of
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.440]   eggs in the short term while enabling growth in the long term as the demand environment
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.280]   improves. Overall, the trend has shown a slowing of
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.440]   poorly placement growth, which is in line with expectations given that most of the poorly
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:16.840]   placement increases in 2019 and early to 2020 were expected to be supportive of new capacity
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:23.600]   that has come online over that period. From Q2 to Q3, COVID-19 related restrictions
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:29.920]   have slowly been rolled back with many businesses and restaurants opening under modified environments
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:35.880]   to protect workers and consumer health. Throughout this process, consumers have proven highly
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.680]   adaptable to the new normal and have continued to modify their shopping and spending habits
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.560]   in response to the new normal environment. This new consumer environment favors the retail
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.760]   channel as many consumers are still required to work from home and choosing to limit exposure
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:56.600]   to potentially more crowded areas. As a result, retail demands for chickens, like that of
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.440]   all proteins, have remained supportive throughout the quarter. While food thefts demand still
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.720]   trail below years ago level, this trend has proven highly adaptable and continues to improve
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.480]   each month from the low points in April led by the QSR segment.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.160]   Entering Q4, the USDA expects production to be flat for the quarter on a year-over-year
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:25.560]   basis, before entry into Q1, in which the USDA expects oil production to grow 0.9 percent
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:32.320]   versus 2020. High unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute to a food microenvironment
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:38.240]   and the fallout effects of COVID-19 will impact the channels differently. We expect the restriction
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   of restaurant capacities, social distancing guidelines, consumer concern for individual
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.880]   health and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations to continue
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:55.220]   favoring the increased frequency of at-home meals. Since chicken continues to be one of
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:01.220]   the most affordable and versatile proteins, retail demand is likely to remain above year
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:06.960]   ago levels. When we expect overall food sales demand to remain more volatile and remain
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.480]   below year ago levels, at least in the near term, QSR's ability to adapt quickly to the
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:19.920]   new environment in a positive sign for the chicken industry moving from late 2020 to 2021.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.120]   Our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions while
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:31.040]   minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions. While we are already well balanced
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.200]   in terms of our birth size exposure, we will remain diligent in seeking opportunities
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.280]   to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.840]   by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers while optimizing
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:50.320]   our existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets. Our key customer approach
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.960]   is strategic and creates a basis for further accelerate growth in important categories
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.320]   by promoting more customized, high quality, innovative products to give us a clear, long
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.520]   term, sustained, competitive advantage while further improving the resilience to market
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:12.480]   filtration. With that, let's turn to additional details to our financials. Our FGNA in the
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.200]   third quarter was higher versus a year ago as we improved the efficiencies of our expenses
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.760]   but increased support for expanding the JustBear brand nationally and the investment for our
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.600]   new prepared foods products, both in the US and Mexico, as well as the inclusion of the
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   new assets in Europe. Also including in the report that FGNA is our $15 million contribution
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:38.520]   to the hometown strong initiative and the DOJ agreement. We will continue to prioritize
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:43.680]   our capital spending plan this year to optimize our product mix that is aimed at improving
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.080]   our ability to supply innovative last monetized products and strengthening partnerships
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:55.000]   with key customers. Even during these uncertain times, while we continue to evaluate all CAPEX
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.320]   projects and defer those we deem known essential, we reiterate our commitment to investing
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.960]   on strong return on capital employee projects that will improve our operational efficiencies
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.680]   and tailor customer needs to further solidify competitive advantage for customers. Our balance
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:16.560]   sheets continue to be robust given our relentless emphasis on cash flows from operating activities,
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.760]   focus on management of working capital and discipline investment in high return projects. Our liquidity
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:27.360]   position remains very strong with more than $1.3 billion in total cash unavailability. We
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:33.760]   have no short term immediate cash requirements without bonds maturing in 2025 and 2027 and
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:39.880]   our turnover maturing in 2023. During the quarter, our net debt was $1.9 billion, the
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:46.640]   lowest since 2016 and a leverage ratio for 2.5 times less than 12 months ago. Our leverage
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.880]   remains at a manageable level and we expect to continue to produce positive cash flows
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.120]   this year, increasing our financial capability to pursue strategic actions. We expect 2020
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:03.740]   interest expense of around $130 to $140 million. We have a strong balance sheet and a leverage
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:08.920]   that is within our target, which are supportive for us to act on great opportunities during
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.560]   these uncertain times. We will remain focused on exercising great care and ensuring that
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.920]   we create shareholder value by optimizing our capital structure while preserving the flexibility
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.400]   to pursue a growth strategy and we continue to consider and evaluate all relevant capital
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.680]   allocation strategies that will match the pursuit of our growth strategy and continue to review
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:34.240]   each prospect accordingly to our value creating standards. Operator, these conclusions are prepared
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:44.340]   and we will now begin the question and answer session. In the interest of allowing equal
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:49.560]   access, we request that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue for any follow
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:55.400]   up. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your substance phone. If you are using
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.600]   a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to minimize background
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:06.200]   noise. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. At this time we will post momentarily
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:17.080]   to assemble our roster. This first question is from Benjamin Toyler with Barclays. Please
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:32.160]   comment. Hi, good morning. My question is regarding COVID-19, how is your current level of absenteeism
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.480]   at plants? How has that evolved in recent weeks considering the continuously high number
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:45.020]   of cases in the U.S.? And also if you can provide some of the kind of a wrong rate of protective
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:51.640]   measures related to COVID-19 during the quarter and what do you see going forward? Thanks.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.320]   Thank you and good morning. First, as we face this global coronavirus pandemic, we have
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.520]   been guided by three principles. First, an uncompromised commitment to the safety of our
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.680]   team members. Second, recognizing and embracing our responsibility to provide quality food
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.840]   for the country and, of course, endeavoring to provide continuing employment opportunities
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.640]   and benefits for our team members during a time of unprecedented economic appeal. So the
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:24.480]   direct costs that we are related to the extra cleaning and in our production in common areas.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.920]   We also provide the PPE and including the masks and feed shoes to all of our team members
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.960]   and we install physical barriers in our production area and, of course, we are maintaining social
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:42.160]   distancing wherever areas we can. We do more than 10,000 barriers within the first 30 days
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:48.460]   of the pandemic and we continue to upgrade those barriers. We also install the dual technology
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:54.360]   UV and biconnery ionization in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:02.660]   viruses. As I mentioned, we are offering free live health online services for all of our
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:09.160]   team members that allow for virtual doctor visits at zero cost. And above all CDC guidelines
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.440]   we remove the vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.200]   community outbreak and that is creating some challenges to our operations because by removing
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:27.240]   those people we have less people at our plants. Yeah, the situation is very fluid. It varies
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:33.600]   from plant to plant but over the last months we have increased our staffing to close to
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:40.560]   levels that we were before COVID. So we are already running a much better mix that we were
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:50.360]   during the Q2 and we are seeing a very good increase in our absenteeism levels. As people
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:56.680]   are more familiar with what we are doing as we are gaining the trust of the entire communities
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:06.520]   people are less reluctant to return to work and with that we have been improving our ability
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:12.480]   to execute the optimal mix. Of course we are also working with our key customers to simplify
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:19.360]   our mix to create a more optimal footprint and with the footprint communication with them
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:29.160]   we are ensuring there are team members we expect to return to the optimal operation in this
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:39.480]   quarter. Perfect thanks so I'm going to work some new results. The next question is from
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:45.280]   Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal please go ahead. Hey good morning everyone. Good morning
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:53.800]   Ken. Just two questions. As you change your mix, what was the mix between big, small and
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:59.520]   medium say last year and then what do you think it's going to be now and then what do you
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:05.560]   think it's going to be in about a year from now as you adjust your product mixes. Yeah
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:11.520]   can we have a well balance between small birds, tree peg and large birds depoting? What we
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:19.320]   are doing is as the demand has been shifting to more retail we've been shifting our operations
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:26.440]   also with the growth of QSR we've also adapted those conditions. What we are doing for 2021
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:34.200]   is to first move that plant from big bird deboning to small bird deboning which will increase
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:42.000]   our presence in that segment. We are also doubling the capacity in our Minnesota plant
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.800]   to comply or support the growth of our key customers and adjust their brand which has
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:56.880]   doubled the sales in the online channel over this quarter. Looking into overall portfolio
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:05.680]   we move from 46% of our total sales in retail to around 51% just in 2020 with small changes
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:14.160]   in our operation. For next year expect 2% increase in that portfolio to the retail and
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:22.040]   1% to 2% increase in the small bird with those two conversions. Great. My next question is
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.240]   can you talk about the sustainability of the Mexican margins? Particularly I did see
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:33.120]   that there was a little bit of a FX benefit. How do you think about the Mexican operation?
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.600]   I think you did say that it's still continuing the momentum into the fourth quarter and how
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:45.400]   do you think about it for 2021? How do we frame it in our minds? Yeah sure. We've been talking
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.920]   about Mexico over the last year that they are very volatile quarter over quarter but
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.720]   they are more stable if you take a longer period of time or within a year. What happened in the
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:00.880]   first quarter or the first semester in Mexico was a complete imbalance during supply and
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:07.120]   demand so the industry increased supply during the first semester and at the same time demand
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:14.400]   because of the COVID-19 really create a challenging environment. As you remember in Mexico there
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:22.200]   was no support from the government with the COVID-19 like we had in U.S. in Europe. There
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:29.400]   was no governmental stimulus or unemployment and benefits. We created a sharp slowdown
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:37.720]   and recession in the region. It really affected the demand both in the food service and retail
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:44.640]   while in U.S. we saw an increasing retail compensating at least partially the shutdown in food services
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.800]   that didn't happen in Mexico and that's why the supply and demand was completely balanced.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:33:00.600]   As the industry adapted their supply for the Q3 and we adapted to that situation as well
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:06.600]   we reduced our costs and we also cut production. The supply and demand improved a lot and we
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:14.480]   saw the rebound in the food service and demand in Q3 and now we have very stable prices during
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:22.600]   this time in Mexico. We expect this to continue during Q4. Q4 has always been a stronger quarter
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:28.800]   for Mexico with the festivities. We don't know at which point that will be reduced because
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:35.480]   of the COVID restrictions. We've seen some increase in cases in Mexico so there could
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:41.020]   be some more restrictions in the Q4 but given the supply and demand situation that we are
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:48.840]   right now the results are sustainable. Now for Q1 we expect the industry to increase production
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:56.640]   to adequate supply and demand and the return to more normal levels. Mexico is really volatile
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:03.800]   quarter over quarter again but we expect to be very stable year over year. Of course our
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.200]   strategy is supportive of the growth to increase the higher margin differentiated products as
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:14.760]   well. We saw a little bit of impact in the prepare foods especially on the more affordable
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:20.440]   products during Q1 but we continue to invest and highly differentiated the pigments products
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.600]   continue to sell really well. Longer term despite the volatility Mexico is a growing economy
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:30.760]   and as the population increase their disposable income it leads to a significant growth in
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:36.040]   fuel consumption. Great I really appreciate the answer.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:45.280]   Thank you OK. The next question is from Ben Bienvenu with Steven Inc. Please go ahead.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:54.180]   Hey good morning. I want to ask you touched on it in your opening comments with ASF in
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.340]   China and Germany. I want to ask on Germany more specifically. I think that's a nice boon
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.400]   for the Tula business. Just curious on what you're seeing in that business both as it
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.300]   relates to the impact on the domestic market and then an uptick in potential demand from
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:12.320]   that market as well and how you think your position to capture that benefit.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:19.360]   Thank you Ben. The operations in Europe are more focused on the retail. So we produce most
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:25.200]   of our products in UK for the retail UK market and because of the high welfare we command
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:34.920]   the premium in that region. The big competition is on the food service sector of imported products
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:43.040]   from Poland and Germany mainly and Spain on the pork side. As the Germans had these issues
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:50.080]   with their production and because of the ban in China it actually increases the sales in
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:58.320]   the UK market. It also creates the opportunity for our UK products to be sold into China. So
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:06.480]   what we saw is that on the what we call fifth quarter products significant increase in pricing
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:12.560]   but on the normal products like loins and others we see the prices more stable because it's
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:19.160]   a zero sum game at the end of the day. So it increases the opportunity to China so that
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   was welcome. I think our sales have like we mentioned have doubled during Q3 and we've
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:31.000]   seen some very stable pricing but it also increases the competition in the food service segments
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:41.040]   in UK. Okay great. My second question is related to grain and apologies if I missed this in
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.200]   your opening comment I did hear your overview of the market. Could you talk about how your
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.320]   position relative to the market you know are you more hand and mouth at the moment? Do you
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.960]   have any basis secured? Any color you could offer there on how your position you know through
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.440]   the balance of fourth quarter and into next year would be helpful.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.320]   Hey Ben this is Joe. Thank you for the question. Obviously we've seen prices of corn and soybean
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   mill increase in the last few months which has been the result of a few factors for corn.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:13.360]   We've seen a reduction from the supply side with USDA reporting six million fewer planted
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.960]   acres than they originally estimated back in March. We also saw our final stocks for 2019
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.160]   end up being 200 million bushels less than was expected when the final counting was done.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.440]   On the current crop we actually for the acres of our planet see pretty good yields above
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:32.720]   trend line yields so it's not an issue on the supply side in terms of U.S. production. But
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:38.120]   on the demand side we've also seen much bigger exports demand primarily driven by China.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.320]   Still the USDA is projecting a carrier out of around 2.1 billion bushels and that includes
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:48.880]   a 30% increase in export demand from last year. So even if export demand ends up higher than
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.960]   what USDA is projecting corn stocks should still be in mind with previous years.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.520]   On soybean's USDA is projecting a 290 million bushel carryout which would be the lowest
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:03.320]   carryout in five years. This projection though includes a 31% increase in export demand driven
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:08.760]   by China. In addition to increase export demand Argentina which is one of the world's largest
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.320]   oil seed exporting countries is in the midst of the historic economic crisis which is causing
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.920]   farmers there to hold back available supplies from the market adding more pressure to the
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:23.100]   U.S. to meet this demand. We believe the market is likely to feel anxious about U.S. soybean
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:28.160]   supplies until there's a resolution to this currency situation in Argentina or in South
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:33.480]   American supplies can be available to meet this demand. In terms of how we're positioned
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.440]   we've always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive to the market conditions and the
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.280]   risk we see and we feel very comfortable with where we are in corn and soy. We do recognize
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.560]   the risks of soybean supplies in the U.S. and our positions reflect that.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:57.680]   Okay awesome thanks and best of all. As a reminder if you have a question please press star then
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:06.800]   one. The next question is from Michael Peacon with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.960]   Yeah hi good morning guys. Just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of you
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:17.920]   know the move I guess you know into retail and you know some of that Big Bird product is
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:23.400]   that being chopped up and put into trays and you know how is that impacting you know some
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:30.000]   of the margins on the commodity business? Yes Mike. There's a lot of product from the
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:37.040]   Big Bird especially during promotional seasonality during the summer that from the Big Bird's
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:43.560]   end up being put in the tray to be sold in the retailers. We continue to do that. I think
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:49.320]   the challenge to the industry is that we need to have the label available and the facilities
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:55.760]   available to do more of that and that's why the industry has not increased more the production
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:03.440]   to the tray pack as we want or as the demand continues to grow. It's also because of that
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:10.480]   that we are increasing the capacity in our Minnesota plant. So as of today yes we are buying Big
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.000]   Bird meat and we continue to put it on a tray especially during Saturdays and I think the
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.720]   whole industry is doing that. Okay great and then my second question is you know just looking
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.980]   at the you mentioned that your absentee rates are starting to go down and you're starting
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:32.840]   to get back to your normal mix. In terms of some of the deboned dark meat do you are you
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:38.280]   starting to return that to you know historic levels and what could that mean for the leg
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.960]   quarter prices which is seeing you know the most pressure. Can that help or you know the
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.760]   fact that China is taking more pork and that help leg quarters or why haven't leg quarter
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:52.800]   prices moved if there's more deboned dark meat potentially being produced and you know it
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:41:00.320]   seems like you know at the very least China is taking more US pork. Yes you're right Mike.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:06.560]   Because of the absenteeism and also the food service industry in US the industry produced
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:14.840]   3% more leg quarters in July and August than the same period last year despite a lower total
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:21.000]   production that put a lot of pressure in the leg quarter pricing. As we are seeing more
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.760]   the reopening of the food service and as we are seeing the absenteeism and the staffing
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:32.040]   of our plants increasing for us and for the whole industry we are seeing more deboning.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:37.560]   We are already at levels comparable to last year in terms of deboning which will reduce
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:43.880]   the pressure in the leg quarters. Of course China has been also more active in the leg
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:50.320]   quarter market over the last month and we are seeing that in the leg quarter inventory
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:57.080]   that was up on a sequentially basis up to August but we are seeing a reduction and also the
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:05.040]   inventory today is down 9% compared to the peak Q1 average that we have so those two factors
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:11.880]   can contribute to the reduction in the leg quarter production which is a commodity item as I mentioned
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:20.600]   and the China interest I think we saw over the last weeks although not today the increase
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:27.880]   in the oil prices and the reduction in the dollar which increase the availability of dollars
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:34.440]   from the developing countries which also increases the demand for leg quarters.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:40.160]   So what could help on the leg quarters going forward is both on supply and demand. On supply
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:46.360]   is exactly what you said last leg quarters because of the improvement in labor efficiencies
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:51.440]   and the more sales in the domestic market on the food service and on demand because of
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:56.760]   low prices and because of more available income in the developing economies.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:12.120]   The next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:19.280]   Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Fabio, just as I am thinking about
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:25.520]   it the small bird and resale channels obviously has been tremendously profitable for you guys
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:32.760]   during this time period and with the plant conversion coming but with commodity big bird
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:38.080]   remaining in the cutout value you have here remaining under such pressure just at what
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:43.880]   point does it make sense to start talking about converting another plant? Whether that's to
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:49.720]   retail or to small bird because it just seems like that big bird portion is not going to
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:56.360]   improve without more capacity either being converted or taking out of the market in some capacity.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:02.880]   Sure. Thank you Peter. I think the decision to convert the plant is a more long term decision
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.440]   and we always make those decisions combined with our key customer strategy. As we see the
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:16.200]   demand of these key customers growing we take action in our portfolio and that makes a lot
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:23.040]   of sense for us to do that conversion right now from that operation from big bird to small
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:29.120]   bird to support this growth. I think again you need to look into a more broader long
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:34.840]   term perspective. We continue to expect the food service sector to rebound. If you look
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:42.040]   at the food service sector today the food service restaurants are now 13% year over year
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:48.860]   and that is impacting the big bird deboning for sure while the Kfrs are up 9%. As we go
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:54.880]   through a more normal operations as we see maybe the development of vaccines we don't
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.800]   know when that's going to happen or we see more openings of the restaurants. We expect
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:07.420]   the food service restaurants especially on the full service to regain some market share
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:14.160]   that they are not operating today. So I think it's a long term decision and it's also a
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:21.360]   very difficult decision to move from big bird to a smaller because we have the growers and
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:27.920]   we have the feed mills. It's all built to that specific bird. Our plants in the United States
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:35.640]   are really customized to that specific segment. So any conversion it really requires significant
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:43.500]   capital and requires some significant changes in the overall supply chain both starting
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:50.840]   from the growers, your feed mills and your field operations. So it's a high capital investment
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:56.680]   that needs to be supported for the long run. So that's why we don't see a lot of conversions
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:03.840]   in our industry. Of course if this situation continues for a longer period of time you
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:10.200]   can see some conversions. I think also it's important to know that some other players
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.720]   don't have the key customer relationships that we have and moving from the big bird to
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:23.680]   the small bird or to the keys ready require a customer and a key customer to support and
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:29.840]   if they don't have those relationships it's harder for them to do some conversions.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:37.160]   That's helpful and then maybe just to follow up you know given where the balance sheet
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.760]   is now and something you talked about in your pair of remarks you know how should we think
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   about M&A potential maybe from a geographic perspective or does it make sense to get bigger
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:54.280]   in pork in Europe and going into 2021. Just any help there and then maybe you can also
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.840]   comment on any updates on your CFO search. Thanks very much.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:04.000]   Sure, in terms of strategy I think our strategy continues to save and our growth strategy
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.240]   continues intact and as we mentioned we have a very strong balance sheet. We look into increasing
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:17.840]   our preparedness operation and our branded operation to create a more balanced portfolio
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:23.640]   and we are also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more value from operational
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:31.160]   efficiencies. We are seeing targets both in the US and outside the US, geographical diversification
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:39.080]   and to growth in Europe and we will evaluate all alternatives to our value creation standards.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:48.680]   In terms of the CFO we are in the process of finding another CFO. We already engage recruiting
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   firms and we should have some news in the near future.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.360]   Great, thanks very much guys.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:04.840]   The next question is from Adam Sanderson with Goldman Sachsen Co. Please go ahead.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:09.840]   Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:16.320]   Hi sister, maybe first just a clarification or a little more detail on the expansion of
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:24.680]   the Minnesota plant for case ready and the conversion of the Texas plant to Smallbird from Big Bird.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:33.160]   What's the net impact on your production volume and what's the capital cost for those projects?
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:39.160]   In terms of total volume, I think we should be just a little bit up. We expect to be to
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:45.360]   grow in line with USDA expectations and the industry for 2021, which is a little bit lower
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:54.520]   than 1%. Yes, as we have more birds in Minnesota, but we also reduce the weight in our operation
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:49:00.200]   on the Big Bird that we are transferring into a Smallbird. So we expect to be for 2021 in
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:09.720]   line with those two. In terms of investment, it's not very significant to our total capex
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:17.400]   as the conversion of the Smallbird plant, it's not, it's a simpler conversion. Of course
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:22.440]   that QSR requires from the assigned which is portioning equipment and some marination
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:28.560]   equipment and we're going to invest in automation in that plant as well. Today is a manual ebony
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:35.500]   operation and we're going to invest in automated ebony. So the investment is close to $20 to
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:43.680]   $25 million in that operation and in the case of case ready operation is close to $70 million.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:49.120]   So overall, it is a total of $100 million that we're going to invest in those two conversions.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:55.940]   Okay, that's a helpful call there. The follow up was, I just want to make sure I have something
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:01.680]   right from the parent remarks that talks with the parent food business in the U.S. declining
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:07.960]   26% I think is what I heard and maybe hoping to expand it on that, that's a business that
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:15.000]   I think has had a bit more challenges over the years and just is, is it really just a question
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.240]   of returns of school and food service traffic or how do we think about that business or a
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:26.160]   margin profile moving forward? Yeah, that's exactly it. We, in our prepared
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:31.160]   food business, we have a strong brand which is the Pierce brand that is meaning a food service
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:38.880]   brand. We also are very strong in the school with our gold case brand. Both those segments
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:45.400]   are the ones that are most affected by the COVID-19. The noncommercial food service that
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:53.940]   includes schools were down 66% at Q2 and now they are down 43%. We are seeing some school
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:51:00.720]   reopens which could help, but it's a segment that is still down 40%. On what we call the
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.320]   commercial food service, which is the street business where our Pierce brand is a leading
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:16.180]   branding wings and chunks, we saw that at Q2 they end up 36% lower than the prior year,
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:21.640]   but they're rebounding and then today they are close to 4% lower than the same period
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:28.000]   last year. So the food service business has been recovering and with that our Pierce brand
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:37.320]   has recovered and our volumes, but the school system is still close to 40% lower than the
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:44.200]   prior year. And that's why we're investing in more retail branded business. As we mentioned
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:51.360]   our Pierce brand has increased more than 30% and we have been very successful in spending
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:56.480]   the just bear brand from the fresh category, but it's been very successful on the online
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:04.600]   segment and also on the higher attribute segment in our key customers to the pre-pair food segment.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:09.880]   All right, great. That's helpful color. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.880]   Thank you, Anna.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:18.840]   The next question comes from Carla Cazella with Safety Morgan. Please go ahead.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:25.200]   Hi. My question is regarding your leverage. The three times target, how comfortable or
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:30.280]   how high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional M&A and are you
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:36.420]   seeing any more M&A opportunities just given the volatility and worldwide protein market?
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:44.980]   Yeah. Thank you Carla. We set this target of two to three times because it's the best capital
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:53.440]   structure that can protect and reduce our interest payments while not creating any problem
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:53:00.600]   for our bonds and for our leverage. The two to three times is in normal operations. Of
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:07.560]   course, during some acquisition if we have a great plan on how to reduce that back we
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:15.720]   can go further. I don't think there is a number that is specific on where we go. I think it's
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:22.240]   more about what is the plan to leverage and of course the plan to leverage could include
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:27.760]   the issue of stock and that's why Google is a public traded company has that opportunity
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.680]   to use the stock as a currency not to increase the leverage to points where we don't think
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:39.960]   it is prudent in the case of significant acquisition that will be transformational for the company.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.800]   Okay. And just one last one.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:49.080]   No, sorry. In terms of M&A, yes, we are seeing more targets. Of course, the whole situation
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:55.760]   about traveling has created some challenges in terms of seeing and visiting assets, but
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:03.000]   we are seeing some targets that are still very interesting to us and could create a lot of
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.640]   value for our shareholders. Okay, great. And then just in the event that JBS is able to
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.840]   list the U.S. business, would that cause any need for changing your structure?
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:21.820]   Yeah, we don't believe so. I think JBS has said many times that they continue to support
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:27.320]   the parents to be a public traded company and just as I mentioned, it is a great way for
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:34.420]   us to keep our growth. We can use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:40.400]   and transformational event for parents. Okay, thank you.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:50.120]   Once again, if you have a question, please press star and one on your telephone.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:57.880]   Gentlemen, there are no more questions registered at this time. I would like to turn the conference
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:03.760]   back over to Fabio Sanri for closing remarks. Well, thank you all. We would like to reiterate
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:09.400]   our continued commitment to our valued team members, to provide them with a safe and healthy
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:14.840]   working environment while supporting our duty to maintain food production and supply to customers.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:20.460]   We are looking forward to closing 2020 with good results in spite of the volatility. Our
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:25.480]   diverse portfolio of differentiated products tailored to support our key customer strategy
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:31.160]   in conjunction with our broad geographic footprint. We continue to generate consistent performance
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:36.600]   and minimize margin volatility in challenging market conditions relative to competitors.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:41.160]   We will continue to seek new growth potential both organically and through acquisitions while
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.360]   offering even more differentiated products portfolio within our business to support key customers
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:51.600]   needs by cultivating a culture of constant innovation. We would like to thank everyone
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:56.280]   in the children's family, including our family farm partners, suppliers and our customers
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:01.080]   who make our business possible. As always, we appreciate your interest in our company.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.360]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:12.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.420]   You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.580]   >> Welcome to the Eversource Energy Q3 2020 Results Conference call.
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.060]   My name is John and I'll be over here for today's call.
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.000]   At this time, all participants are on the list in only mode.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.900]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.300]   During the question and answer session, if you do have a question, press star then one
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.500]   on your touch phone phone.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.280]   Please note that this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.700]   And I want to turn the call over to Jeffrey Cotton.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.220]   >> Thank you very much John.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.300]   Good morning and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.060]   I'm Jeff Cotton, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.360]   During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.220]   And as you can see on slide one, some of the statements made during this investor call may
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.100]   be forward looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.020]   of the U.S. private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.820]   The forward looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.660]   to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.760]   to differ materially for forecast and projections.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.100]   These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.720]   Additional information about the various factors
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.920]   that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on form 10K
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.260]   for the year ended December 31st, 2019 and our form 10Q for the three months ended June 30th, 2020.
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.500]   Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAP measures
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.800]   and how those measures reconcile to GAP results is contained
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.080]   within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10K.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.800]   Seeking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.620]   Also joining us today are Joe Nolan, our Executive Vice President
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.560]   for strategy, customer and corporate relations.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.240]   John Marrera, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory and Jay Booth, our Controller.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.640]   Now I will turn slide two and turn over the call to Phil.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.040]   >> Thank you, Jeff.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.800]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.680]   I hope everyone on the call remains healthy and that your families are safe and doing well.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.040]   This morning, I'll cover a variety of areas, review the results of the third quarter,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.840]   discuss recent regulatory developments including the acquisition of the assets
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.200]   of Columbia GAS of Massachusetts, provide an update on recent developments
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.680]   around our offshore wind partnership with Orsif.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.040]   I'll start with slide two, noting that recurring earnings were $1.02 per share
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.880]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of $0.98 per share in the third quarter
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.320]   of 2019.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.600]   GAP results which include a charge of $0.01 per share relating
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.840]   to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia GAS of Massachusetts told $1.01 per share
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.920]   in the third quarter of 2020.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:22.000]   In the first nine months of 2020, recurring earnings excluding Columbia GAS acquisition costs total $2.80
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.200]   per share compared with recurring earnings of $2.69 per share in the first nine months
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.280]   of 2019 and excluding the Northern Path transmission impairment charge.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.440]   GAP results for September of this year were $2.76 per share.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.280]   Turning to our business segments, our electric distribution segment earned $0.60 per share
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.400]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.720]   The low earnings were results of both higher storm restoration costs
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.680]   and property tax expense as well as the impact of sub-share dilution.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.320]   Our electric transmission segment earned $0.36 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.640]   with recurring earnings of $0.33 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.440]   Improved results were driven by the continued investment and reliability
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.600]   in our transmission facilities partially offset by shared dilution.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.360]   Our gas distribution segment lost $0.04 per share in the third quarter
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.880]   of 2020 compared with a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of last year.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.760]   Improved results were due to higher revenues.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.800]   I should note that because we didn't close on our acquisition
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.640]   of Columbia GAS of Massachusetts assets until October 9th,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.160]   the transaction had no impact on this gas segment,
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.080]   the segment during the quarter, each quarter this year we booked acquisition related costs
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.760]   at the parent and had segregated them for increased transparency.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.560]   Beginning in the fourth quarter of this year ongoing results
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.280]   of our new gas franchise which is named Eversource Gas Company
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.640]   of Massachusetts will be reflected in the natural gas segment.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.080]   Integration related costs however will continue to be recorded separately
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.120]   at the parent and excluded from our recurring gas earnings.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.040]   Our water distribution segment earned $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2020
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.560]   compared with earnings of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.680]   Improved results were due to a $3.5 million after tax gain
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.480]   on the sale of our Henum Massachusetts area facilities to the town.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:10.460]   Eversource parent earned $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020 excluding the Columbia gas
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.880]   of Massachusetts asset acquisition cost equal to our earnings in the third quarter of last year.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.260]   As you probably noted in our earnings release and can see on slide three,
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.440]   we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings per share guidance of $3.00 and $0.60
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.160]   to $3.00 and $0.70 and it is excluding the non-recurring costs related
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.520]   to the purchase of Columbia gas Massachusetts assets.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.600]   We are also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.060]   from our core regulated business through the year 2024.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.540]   We continue to be -- to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range largely
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.080]   due to the investments we need to make on behalf of our customers
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.960]   as we outlined for you earlier in the year.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.920]   As a reminder, while we fully expect the Columbia gas assets to be accreted
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.520]   to our earnings per share starting immediately in 2021,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.040]   we have not yet updated our long-term financial outlook to reflect the acquisition
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.480]   of Columbia gas assets in our capital, our cap backs that are our earnings growth.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.180]   In addition, as we disclosed previously, earnings
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.200]   from offshore wind would be incremental to our core business growth.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:40.180]   We'll provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecasts adding
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.520]   in every Swiss gas company Massachusetts projections and provide an update
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.840]   of our offshore wind partnership during our year-end call in late February.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.500]   From the third quarter results, I'll turn to slide four
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:03.940]   and our experience restoring power after tropical storm ETAIs ravaged Connecticut on October 4th.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.840]   We serve 149 cities and towns in Connecticut and every one
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.900]   of these communities suffered damage from ETAIs, much of it catastrophic.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:21.620]   As you can see on the slide, we had nearly 22,000 damage locations that we had
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:27.740]   to address and brought in an army of electric restoration and tree crews to restore power,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.420]   all the while working on the restoration in a pandemic setting.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:38.800]   The restoration process lasted nine days, meaning we completed our work one
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.680]   to two days faster than we had in the last two tropical storms that hit Connecticut,
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.700]   even though we had 30 to 35 percent more damage location.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:55.460]   And most importantly, we completed that work safely with no serious electrical contact
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.100]   and no COVID exposure among the enormous workforce we brought to Connecticut.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:07.840]   Just a tremendous effort by all of our employees from across all parts of every source.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:16.140]   At this time, we estimate that deferred cost across all three states will total more
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:23.160]   than $275 million, with a vast majority of that's incurred in Connecticut.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.040]   That figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.320]   We're still actively pursuing invoices from hundreds of vendors
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.260]   that assisted us during the statewide restoration effort.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.820]   Where we were setting new poles or hanging miles of new wires
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:48.020]   or replacing hundreds of transformers, these related costs ought to be capitalized.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:54.540]   The ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation of performance in safely
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.140]   and expeditiously restoring power to our customers is pending an ongoing review
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.500]   by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or PURO.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.980]   That review is scheduled to be completed in late April of 2021.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:19.200]   Sticking with our regulated business, I'll turn to slide five and a review
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.700]   of this year's distribution rate reviews.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.160]   This past Friday, the Massachusetts Department
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.900]   of Public Utilities issued its decision in the Ed Star Gas rate review that we filed last year.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.140]   It supports our continued investment in the Ed Star Gas system
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.640]   on behalf of our 300,000 customers.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.720]   The decision allows Ed Star Gas to increase distribution revenues
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.560]   by $23 million on an annualized basis.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.080]   The DPU approved an ROE of 9.9% and a capital structure
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.140]   with 54.77% equity.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:02.200]   It also permits us to implement performance based rate making for a 10 year term
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:09.820]   that with sounds operating performance by Ed Star Gas will target annual base rate increases
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.180]   of inflation plus 1.03%.
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:19.720]   This is an earning sharing mechanism that would return 75% of the benefit to customers
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.360]   should we see the ROE of 10.9% and sharing mechanism
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.820]   on the downside if our ROE falls below 8.4%.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.580]   Also exciting is the decision also approves our first ever geothermal pilot program.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:40.040]   Our other longstanding rate proceeding involves public service of New Hampshire.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.060]   In New Hampshire last month, we and all the parties
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.700]   to the PSNH rate case filed a proposed settlement in the rate review
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.360]   that is pending for nearly, you know, a year and a half.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:57.660]   You can see from the slide, we settled on a $45 million annualized rate increase
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:05.740]   that includes a 9.3% return on equity and a 54.4% equity layer.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:11.340]   Should regulators approve the settlement, the permanent increase would take effect
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.520]   in January 1st of 2021.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.020]   You may recall that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission allowed us
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:26.780]   to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately $28 million back in July.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:33.060]   July 1st of 2019, the final approved rates would be retroactive back
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.660]   to that date, 18 months.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:41.280]   We would recover that in a true up over the course of the year 2021.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.240]   We can settle, consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.220]   to PSNH's first general increase in about a decade.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:56.140]   And have asked the New Hampshire PUC to approve the settlement before the end of November.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.080]   From the rate review, reviews, I'll turn to slide six.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.520]   And our recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas in Massachusetts
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:12.160]   for $1.1 billion of cash excluding working capital adjustments.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.280]   Most of these assets were signed to Emersuas Gas Company in Massachusetts,
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.540]   a new subsidiary I mentioned that we formed in May of 2020.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.460]   As you can see on the slide, much of Emersuas Gas's service territory is adjacent
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.020]   to Endstar Gas or Yankee Gas Service Territories.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:37.360]   Additionally, Endstar Electric already provides electric service to about 20
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.120]   of the communities that Emersuas Gas serves with natural gas.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:49.140]   As a result, we expect to realize operational benefits for our newest 330,000 natural gas customers
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.380]   and the communities where they live.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:00.400]   To finance the transaction, we sold approximately $500 million of equity in June
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.300]   and we financed the debt portion of the transaction in August.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.460]   And again, we are very confident that this transaction will be accretive
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.840]   to our earnings per share in 2021 and incrementally accretive in the years ahead.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.880]   A critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.500]   to all stakeholders is an eight-year rate plan that we negotiated with the Massachusetts Attorney
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.900]   General and other key priorities prior to our filing
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.200]   with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.180]   The key elements of that plan are listed on slide seven.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.840]   It will allow us to make the necessary investments in our Emersuas Gas of Mass System
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.940]   and reflect those investments and rates in a reasonably timely manner.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.640]   We're thankful that the DPU approved the settlement and the acquisition very quickly.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.160]   Now that we have the key to the property and a long-term plan in place,
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.900]   we are focused on providing our new Emersuas Gas customers with the same high level
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:06.320]   of service that we provide our other 550,000 natural gas distribution company customers
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.180]   that we have in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:14.420]   As I noted earlier, we plan to integrate Emersuas Gas
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:20.160]   of Massachusetts into our updated 5-year projections that we'll provide you in February.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:27.740]   We continue to project approximately $3 billion of regulated company capital investments this year.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:33.920]   Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and the need to take crews off of capital projects
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.520]   for a significant part of August to deal with the aftermath of tropical storm Isaias.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.240]   Through September, our capital investments totaled approximately $2.2 billion.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:52.220]   That's approximately the same level as this time last year in 2019.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:57.160]   We made considerable progress on our transmission capital program in the third quarter,
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.880]   putting several projects into service at or below budget.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:08.760]   These benefits of lower cost will slow through to New England's electric customers.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:15.900]   From the regulated business, I'll turn to offshore wind partnership with Orsted on slide 8.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.800]   We've had a few developments since our July 31st earnings call.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:27.960]   The most significant development was that in August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:35.200]   posted a complete review schedule for our 130 megawatts south fork project on London Island.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.300]   The schedule culminates in a decision on a construction and operations permit,
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.380]   or COP as it's known, in mid January of 2022.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.160]   We are also making progress on the other permits.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.840]   In September, we filed a settlement proposal with the New York Department of Public Service
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.700]   to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the construction operations
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.960]   and maintenance of the project that lies within New York jurisdiction.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:12.780]   In October, several of New York State agencies signaled their support for this proposal
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.820]   by signing on to the agreement.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.400]   We've structured an agreement on host community payments
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.720]   in the necessary real estate rights with the town of East Hampton
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.940]   where the offshore cable will land and will be connected to the Long Island grid.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.240]   New York Public Service Commission citing here in for south fork is scheduled
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.740]   to commence the first week of December.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:42.620]   We continue to expect the state signing process to be completed in 2021
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.120]   before bone issues the COP.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:52.100]   Based on that schedule, we now expect the project end to service in the fourth quarter of 2023.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:58.480]   This is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our May and July earnings calls
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.520]   while we were still waiting for the review schedule.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:10.440]   Joining to our other project, you recall that we filed our bone application for Revolution Wind in March.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:17.120]   We expect bone to establish a review schedule for that project in the first quarter of 2021.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:24.360]   We do not expect to provide an updated in-service date for this project until the schedule is issued,
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:31.600]   but at this point it is unlikely that the project will end the service by the end of 2023.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.500]   Also, we filed our sunrise wind application with bone on September 1
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.220]   and expect bone to establish a review schedule for the project next year.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.060]   Once we receive that review schedule, we'll be able
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.660]   to better estimate a more up-to-date in-service schedule.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.300]   But again, at this time it would seem that the end of 24 in-service is not likely.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:19:01.580]   We're very optimistic about our offshore wind business and expect to have many opportunities
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:09.600]   over the coming months and years to expand our offshore wind partnership beyond the 1,714 megawatts currently
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.480]   on the contract.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   As we mentioned before, we have enough lease capacity to construct at least 4,000 megawatts
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.600]   on the 550 square miles of ocean tracks that we have
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.660]   under long-term lease off the southeast coast of Massachusetts.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:33.280]   To this point, on October 20th, we submitted a number of alternative bids
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.240]   into the second New York offshore wind IRSP, where the state is looking
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.820]   for between 1,000 and 2,500 megawatts.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.960]   New York State officials have indicated that they expect to announce the winners.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   Before the end of the year.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.120]   Our sunrise project, as a reminder, won the largest portion
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.520]   of New York's first IRSP last year, 880 megawatts.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:07.500]   Additionally, just last week Rhode Island Governor Gina Romando announced
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:13.400]   that her state will target early next year for issuing an IRSP to 600 megawatts
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:19.820]   of additional offshore wind. As you know, the majority of our revolution wind capacity,
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:25.120]   400 megawatts, will be sold to Rhode Island with the balance going to Connecticut.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.460]   Thank you very much for joining us this morning.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.680]   And I'll turn the call back over to John.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.800]   >> Thanks, Phil.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.720]   And I'll turn the call back to John just to remind you how
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.240]   to enter questions in the Q&A queue.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.440]   >> Thank you.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.560]   If you do have a question, press star then 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.860]   Once again, that's star then 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.900]   If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.860]   >> Thank you, John.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.220]   Our first question this morning is from Shah from Guggenheim.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.340]   Good morning, Shah.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.120]   >> Good morning, Jeff.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.720]   Good morning, Phil.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.440]   >> Good morning, Shah.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.160]   >> So a couple questions here.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.340]   I just feel some of your language around sort of the growth rate, you know,
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.680]   obviously which still excludes Columbia Gas and offshore wind.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.220]   Obviously, these are, you know, very creative and you're already conservatively kind
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.340]   of well within your band.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.280]   So should we sort of be thinking about these incremental items
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:31.080]   as potentially rating your growth rate to maybe 6% to 8% or something
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.820]   that will hit you to the top end and then sort of extend that runway
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.360]   with your current trajectory?
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.460]   I mean, the reason we'll ask is 6% to 8% seems to be sort
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.880]   of that new top quartile bucket in our space
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.260]   where 5% to 7% is becoming a little bit more typical.
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.940]   So curious how you're sort of thinking about this?
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.500]   Do you see value to be a talk to be in the top quartile
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.160]   or you don't think you need to reward it for it?
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.860]   So curious on that as we think about you layering its plan.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.160]   >> Sure. Sure.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.500]   Thanks for the question and I hope you've been doing well.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   Certainly the addition of Columbia Gas and we'll be additive
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.160]   to our existing forecast.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.340]   So we're working through all the details of that so we're able
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:22.020]   to provide you with a full update in February but we expect
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.880]   to get significant benefit from that franchise.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.220]   And as you say, we also expect as those offshore wind projects come
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.540]   on line to also be additive.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.140]   To remind folks, I know I said it but and you did
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:45.600]   that the 5% to 7% growth rate is from the existing core business
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.180]   which doesn't include Columbia assets.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.960]   It also doesn't include grid modernization activities
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.180]   that are currently pending in Connecticut
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:05.020]   and New Hampshire or AMI that could be a potential
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.880]   to move forward relatively soon in Massachusetts in terms
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.980]   of taking a look at that by the regulator.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.340]   So I see that we have a number of levers to grow
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.880]   and grow at even a higher rate than we expected before.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.200]   >> Got it.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.920]   That's helpful.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.380]   And then just lastly for me is can you just maybe talk a little
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:34.520]   bit about your expectations for the legislation in Connecticut?
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.680]   I mean the legislation that passed was more constructive
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.000]   than the draft legislation but obviously some disappointment
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.520]   with the refunds and penalties offset
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.760]   by the potential upside from like PBRs.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.660]   So sort of how are you guys thinking about this entirely?
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.880]   >> Sure. The energy legislation we've said consistently
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.000]   that PBR is a formula and a template
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.560]   that we think is effective.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.860]   We have PBR structures in other states and we think
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.480]   that having a robust discussion on PBR
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.600]   in Connecticut makes a lot of sense
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.480]   so we're very supportive of that provision.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.920]   You know, really, you know,
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:26.000]   the energy legislation directed Pura to evaluate that
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.360]   and open a docket by the middle of next year so June of 2021
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.960]   and it authorizes Pura to, you know, establish storm standards
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.280]   and potential penalties as you mentioned.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.040]   There is an increased potential of penalties.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.480]   Currently those penalties are two and a half percent
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.520]   of our distribution revenues in Connecticut
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.000]   and that goes up to 4 percent.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.500]   So, you know, it also gives Pura some additional time,
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.540]   you know, to review cases so, you know,
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.880]   which is also something that, you know, seems to be appropriate.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.720]   So the legislation as you indicated is out there
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.520]   and Pura is working through the details of it and we expect
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.200]   to be working through that in a constructive way with them
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.680]   over the next several months.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.560]   >> Got it.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.060]   Terrific.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.000]   That's all I had today.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.780]   Thanks, guys.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.720]   >> All right.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.120]   >> Thanks.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.680]   >> Thanks Sharke.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.440]   Our next question is from Steve Fleischman from Wolfe.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.600]   Good morning, Steve.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.580]   >> Good morning.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.940]   Oh, can you hear me?
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.760]   >> Yes, Steve, I can.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.640]   >> Yeah, great.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:46.760]   So just a question on the delays in your offshore wind projects,
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.740]   could you maybe talk to, I know we don't know the exact timing,
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:56.480]   but how should we think about the impact on the economics
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.720]   of those projects from delay or puts and takes
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.800]   and is it hurting the economics
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.600]   of the projects you already have signed up to?
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.640]   >> Yeah, thanks for your question, Steve.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.880]   And I hope you and your family are doing well.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:20.860]   I guess, to go to the puts and takes piece, you know,
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.480]   I don't think that folks should automatically think
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.520]   that schedule changes result in ups or downs.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:35.360]   There's some benefits or that people may not consider in that.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:41.440]   So certainly, if you are looking at adjusted schedules,
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.020]   you might be able to adjust your installation vessel
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.480]   optimization better, you know,
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.420]   the turbine sizes themselves are getting larger
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:59.480]   so you could move to larger turbine sizes if projects are due
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.260]   at a later time period versus an earlier time period.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:07.760]   And certainly, the cost supply chain and availability
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.080]   of materials and supply chain is only getting better.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.940]   So I would say that, you know, there's opportunities
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:21.320]   for improved cost economics as you move into a schedule
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.860]   that, you know, you may not think of, you know,
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.760]   I think people generally think of projects as, you know,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.000]   if it's a delay, it's a cost increase
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.440]   but there are other elements that work here
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:37.120]   on the offshore wind business that offset that.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.920]   >> How about any negatives, how about, like, do you lose,
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.560]   are you going to lose any tax credits or anything else?
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.360]   >> Yes, certainly.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.000]   >> Like, it's just time value?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.400]   >> Yes. In terms of the schedules we're looking at,
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.920]   we don't expect to have any impact on our tax assumptions
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.040]   but certainly significant delays.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.240]   Delays could have impacts on your tax assumption.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.720]   Delays could also have impacts on contracts that you have
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.760]   with counterparties but in our specific case,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.240]   so that's the general case, in our specific case,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.180]   we're confident that we have the ability to work within both
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.240]   of those the tax area and the contract area
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.360]   in an effective way with where we see the schedules going
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.240]   in the future.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.560]   >> Okay. Thank you.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.480]   >> Thank you.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.800]   Our next question is from Angie from Seaport Global.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.280]   Good morning Angie.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.240]   >> Good morning.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.640]   So I have a question about Massachusetts.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.400]   You know, they've had this very constructive decision
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.800]   for ENSOR gas but the state is clearly looking
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.360]   up to the future of gas LDCs
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.000]   and so how do you guys see it,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.360]   especially in light of the fact
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.080]   that you just acquired an additional gas utility
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.360]   in Massachusetts?
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.680]   >> Good morning Angie and thank you for your question
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.320]   and hope you're doing well.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.360]   You know, the way that I would position it
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.960]   or the way that I think people should think about it is
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.920]   that there's nobody, first of all, who's more aggressive
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.600]   in terms of looking at clean energy strategies
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.160]   and carbon reduction than ever sourced in terms
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.400]   of having carbon neutral goals like 2030.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:40.920]   We have worked effectively with all parties in all states
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.120]   but in Massachusetts where the Attorney General
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:49.440]   and others want to take a look at, you know, sort of the future
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.160]   or the outlook in terms of the gas business.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.200]   We've been working with these intervening parties
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.720]   for many years and we'll continue to work with them
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.160]   on what we think an appropriate strategy is there.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:12.120]   So this is a long-term outlook in terms of that the state wants
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.920]   to, you know, have aggressive clean energy
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.680]   and carbon reduction targets with wholly supportive of that
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.760]   and we look forward to working, you know,
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.480]   with all the parties there but we don't see it as a threat
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:32.280]   to the gas distribution business in the region at all.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:40.160]   >> Okay and in Connecticut, you know, this recent back
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.520]   and forth between you guys and Pora about the extension
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.960]   of the lack of basically disconnections on the back of COVID,
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.120]   I mean it sounds a bit concerning that Pora is pushing
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.880]   back so strong that they don't need to sign
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.680]   off on that extension.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.200]   I mean I would assume that it's an actual practice,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.320]   normal practice for a regulated utility to seek recovery
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.920]   of these, you know, under-recovered revenues.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.320]   I mean can you give us a sense, you know,
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.200]   how you see it in Connecticut given the latest, you know,
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.040]   legislative changes and also some deterioration
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.880]   and, you know, negative relationships in the state?
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:29.560]   >> Yes, so we are not doing shut offs across all,
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.000]   any of our franchises at this point and specifically,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.200]   you know, we're working, you know, we're working with customers,
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.600]   we're working with fuel agencies, assistance agencies
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.040]   on an approach here that works,
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.440]   that works best for customers.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.920]   We've also engaged with Pura as you mentioned
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   and other government officials, you know, on this issue.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.360]   So I'm confident that we'll get to a good place here,
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.800]   you know, nobody wants to burden customers with any more
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.120]   than we're all ready, all of us are burdened with
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:10.040]   in terms of the economic conditions and COVID, et cetera.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.480]   So we're working through the issue,
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.520]   we're working with customers as I say
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.560]   and some of the assistance agencies and I'm sure we'll get
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.920]   to a good outcome here.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.440]   >> Very good.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.040]   Thank you.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.520]   >> Thank you Angie.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.120]   Next question is from Julian from Bank of America.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.080]   Good morning Julian.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.520]   >> Hey, good morning team.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.320]   Thanks for the time.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.800]   I hope all of you are doing well
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.680]   and safe in families as well.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.800]   Perhaps just to pick up off of, or perhaps clarify if I can,
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.520]   some of the last rounds of questions.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.120]   When you talk about the 4Q roll forward,
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.480]   are you going to be rolling to 2025 and then more specifically,
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.320]   how do you think about including or excluding offshore wind
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.560]   in light of the uncertainty described?
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.160]   Should we expect that offshore wind should continue to be
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.880]   at least for those projects
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.480]   where there's an undetermined date to continue
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.080]   to be excluded there?
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.480]   >> Julian, thanks for your question and your comments
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.040]   that I hope you and your family are doing well too.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:20.280]   Just to clarify, our history has been to add another year
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.560]   into the outlook so 2025 would be that year
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.000]   since our forecast goes through the 2024 time period
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.600]   so that is something that you should expect to see.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.240]   And really our view on how to look at offshore wind,
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.800]   it doesn't change by any of the schedule items.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.200]   We talked about today, or we've looked at it
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:49.680]   as showing the core business as the driver
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.120]   and the foundational element of the growth rate
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.080]   and then to show that wind is attitude to that in what way.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.560]   So that would be the intent going forward.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.680]   I think that what I've been asked this question before,
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:11.480]   the answer is was and still is, as more years of wind come
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.200]   in to the actual results of that particular year,
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.160]   then to me it makes more sense to roll it all together.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.000]   But at this stage, the expectation especially
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.840]   in this upcoming February update would be
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.040]   to have the core business extend that through 2025
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:37.720]   and then show offshore wind in addition to that.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.520]   >> And if you don't mind elaborating a little bit further,
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.880]   I know that there's a certain degree
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.920]   of uncertainty on exactly the permming schedule
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.200]   that inhibits your ability to say when these projects
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.400]   in a region of service.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.120]   Can you at least try to put some more parameters
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.880]   around what each of these pieces of the process could take
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.080]   such that there's like a window if you will?
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.840]   It may be too early.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.040]   >> Yeah, so in terms of, you know,
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.400]   people have realized out there and we've been asked questions
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.320]   that I think you've asked us the questions in terms of,
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.160]   you know, with delays on vineyard wind and other things,
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.040]   there's been some delays in terms of bone notice
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:26.960]   of intent and to prepare their environmental impact statement
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.520]   and frankly, we would have expected, you know,
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:36.560]   our original schedule that some of these NOIs, you know,
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.360]   to prepare the environmental impact statement would be out by now.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.280]   So these are expected, I believe, you know,
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.240]   the plan schedule for reviewing and releasing these is underway.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.040]   So I wouldn't expect, you know, a significant change
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.040]   in the schedule, but at this stage, it would be prudent to wait
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.040]   to see the schedule that comes out of the bone before we commit
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.720]   to a final in-service day.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.520]   I wouldn't expect it to be significant.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.200]   >> Got it, excellent.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.320]   All right, I'll pass it from there.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.840]   Thank you so much, Steve.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.240]   >> Thanks, Julian.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.040]   Next question is from Durgesh from Evercore.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.400]   Good morning, Durgesh.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.920]   >> Hey, good morning, guys.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.520]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.640]   Just following up on, you know, the offshore wind here,
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:38.320]   what do you expect, you know, there's this EIS decision I suppose
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.520]   that is going to be out or EIS tape and rather this month
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.920]   or early December, what do you expect there
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:51.000]   and then how does that impact your future project timelines?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.960]   >> Yeah, the notice of intent, they contain a plan schedule,
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.160]   you know, that in the NOIs they have contained bones,
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.240]   plan schedule for reviewing each of the cops.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.000]   So that would be an important piece of information
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.280]   to have available.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.040]   So that's really what's included in that.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.560]   It's a plan schedule for reviewing the cop that comes
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.960]   out with the notice of intent.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.440]   >> All right, so I guess maybe I'm talking
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.760]   about the environmental impact statement.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.520]   Isn't there an environmental impact statement
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.280]   that Bohm is supposed to sort of put out here
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.400]   in the next few weeks?
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.840]   >> You're talking about the one for Vineyard, right?
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.400]   >> Yes, yes, yes.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.840]   >> Oh, okay, yeah, I'm not, I apologize.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.760]   You probably have to ask Vineyard Windham about that.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.600]   >> Okay, but that doesn't have a read-through for you
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.240]   or your offshore wind project?
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.800]   I guess that's what my question was.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:02.000]   >> Well certainly, all of the developers off the coast,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.600]   you know, we've been going through this cumulative impact study
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:12.000]   and looking at spacing and wind turbines and we came
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.760]   up with a one nautical mile by one nautical mile spacing.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.480]   So certainly, there could be components that come out
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   in any decision for Vineyard Wind that you'd have to, you know,
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.680]   take a look at to see if it has any impacts, you know,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.360]   to other developers including us.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.680]   But in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing,
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:41.480]   I think Vineyard might have a better perspective of that.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.440]   >> Okay, perfect.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.240]   That's all I had guys.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.480]   Thank you so much.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.280]   >> All right, thanks Dorgesh.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.240]   Our next question is from Jeremy from J.T. Morgan.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.520]   Good morning Jeremy.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.720]   >> Good morning, thanks for having me.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.920]   Just wanted to start off with what are the benefits
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:04.960]   of looping ConEd into the proposed Sunrise Wind 2 RFP here?
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.160]   Every source has the experience of building transmission
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.120]   and we're curious what additional competitive advantages ConEd
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.720]   provides here to this specific project.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.040]   Can you provide details on potential ownership
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.840]   interests for each entity and does ownership interest change
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.320]   once construction is complete and the project is in service?
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.040]   >> Thanks for your question Jeremy, hope you're doing well.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.280]   I guess I would say on the first part of the question,
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:38.480]   sort of obviously ConEd has local knowledge of New York
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.640]   and their service territory and the network and the operation
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:49.280]   of the transmission and delivery system that are valuable
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.000]   to any party if you're operating in New York.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.200]   So I'd say they bring a knowledge and skill set of the area
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:04.360]   that certainly we don't have as depth of knowledge
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.680]   as they would, so a certain skill set there
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.720]   that the local player would bring.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:19.160]   So in terms of what the components of a relationship would be,
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.440]   those things are all to be discussed as we move through
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.160]   but it's certainly beneficial I think to the project
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:32.040]   and have somebody with ConEd skill sets involved.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.920]   >> Got it and as far as potential ownership interest,
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.680]   is there any kind of thoughts on how that could develop?
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.960]   >> Not at this time, no.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.240]   >> Got it and then will the delay
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.520]   and offshore wind permitting have any impact
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.040]   on the current financing plans?
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.600]   Is it fair to assume the 700 million of equity
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.840]   and your current private plan moves to the back end here
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.720]   and how is offshore wind catbacks spending track,
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.400]   Peter Day versus the 300 to 400 million range
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.160]   that you expected?
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.800]   >> We haven't disclosed a range that we've expected.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.680]   We've talked about how much we expected to spend, you know,
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:28.600]   this year, you know, you know, just for the year 2020
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.920]   and it's tracking somewhat close
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.600]   that I'd say is probably a little bit under what we expected
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.720]   at this time.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:42.640]   In terms of the financing, you're right that we announced
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.320]   a year ago, you know, this $2 billion of equity need
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.160]   that would support the forecast and we issued 1.3 of that
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.120]   so this 700 million remaining that --
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.320]   and I would say the same thing as I've said all along
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:03.920]   as we'd be opportunistic and consider what our capital forecast
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.000]   are and what the market conditions are, you know,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.600]   as we look to fulfill the rest of that offering
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.960]   that we discussed.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.360]   >> Got it.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:16.920]   That's helpful.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.560]   I'll leave it there.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.640]   Thank you.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.440]   >> Okay, thanks Jeremy.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.920]   Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glen Rock.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.640]   Good morning Paul.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.080]   Good morning guys.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.600]   >> Good morning Paul.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:34.800]   I just wanted to follow up on the draft decision in Connecticut
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.640]   on Monday and what your thoughts were on it, any --
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.680]   if it were, in fact, to become a final order,
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.880]   what the potential impact could be?
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.760]   >> Are you talking about the draft information on rates
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.840]   or can you be more specific?
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   >> Sure, there was a draft decision on Monday
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.240]   in the per case associated with the rates, right?
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.120]   The rate review that was reversed,
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.680]   that proceeding, I can tell you the specific name.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.440]   >> No, that's okay.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.960]   You know, I just wanted to --
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.800]   I just wanted to be specific as somebody else mentioned
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.920]   has been a number of different --
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.920]   >> Yeah, I know you're a lot.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:30.480]   So this -- so as you recall, the purest suspended the rates
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.440]   that we had implemented over the summer, both we and UI,
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.640]   to take an additional look,
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.440]   I think this is what you're referring to.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.240]   So we did receive the draft order
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.240]   and really it's kind of hot off the press
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.600]   we're currently evaluating that
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.160]   and we're going to, you know, see what comments we might have
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.800]   and comments on the draft could do.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.960]   I think it's the 12th of November
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.120]   so we have some time to flush out anything.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.920]   But it's consistent with --
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.720]   on first flush, I'd say,
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.280]   it's consistent with the purest desire
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.360]   to have some rate changes, you know,
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.960]   instead of implementing rates at peak times of usage,
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.120]   maybe such as July implement them on --
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.760]   you know, change the time of it to implement it
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:25.200]   maybe in a -- in a shoulder month, like May or something,
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.400]   and move to annual reconciliation
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.360]   as opposed to semi-annual.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:34.720]   So this would, you know, it is delayable.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.440]   This could have -- effectively, this is a cash flow item
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:43.040]   and it could have an impact on our deferrals
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.840]   that we have in place there.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.840]   But, you know, I think it's generally consistent
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.960]   with the desire, as we said,
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.880]   to move off of these peak periods
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.280]   for making rate changes into shoulder periods
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.840]   and see what we've got from there.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.360]   But we're actively reviewing that last night and today
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.560]   and we will be -- and have any comments
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.680]   that we would have would do, as I said, on the 12th.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.760]   Okay. There was one part of it
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.800]   that would reduce the carrying charges
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.080]   from the -- from lack to a prime rate on a variety
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.640]   of reconciliation mechanisms.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.800]   Is there any -- do we have any --
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.240]   I know this is off the press and everything,
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.320]   but do we have any sort of forecast as to what the --
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.040]   those reconciliation mechanisms,
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.400]   like how much capital might be tied up in those?
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:44.920]   No. That is a point to the carrying cost at prime,
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:49.200]   which is consistent in some of the jurisdictions, I guess.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:55.320]   So, no, it's not a significant, you know, item,
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.560]   but it's certainly one that Pura had put out there
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.640]   in the draft is to recover the deferred balances
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:07.920]   with a prime rate versus a lack.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.320]   Okay. And then just -- we don't know
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   who the president's going to be at the same.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.880]   But if there was a change in administration,
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:22.240]   do you think that could have or not have maybe a significant
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.680]   impact on the OEM permitting process
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.880]   with respect to offshore wind?
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.480]   The -- the permitting process, I mean, when we meet
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:40.200]   with the BOM, you know, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.360]   you know, that people are active.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.720]   We're actively working.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:48.240]   We're actively having, you know, Zoom meetings or team calls
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:56.360]   or whatever the video capabilities are that we're using.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.600]   But, you know, we're actively working that
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.440]   and I can assure you that the people
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.400]   and the agencies are working full speed regardless
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.680]   of, you know, who's, you know, president
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.800]   or what the election results are.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.400]   But certainly, it would be good to have, you know,
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.440]   the results of the election.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.840]   I think we've all, as a country, you know,
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.000]   that the election results are something
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.680]   that we've all targeted out there.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.720]   And wherever you fall on the political spectrum,
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.880]   it's good to have certainty as opposed to uncertainty.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.280]   So I think we're all looking forward to what the final outcome
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.040]   is there so we can -- we can move forward.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.240]   >> Okay. So just for my clarity, the process
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.040]   of the BOM is pretty much the agency
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.720]   of the sort of the bureaucratic process that's going on.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.200]   Really, you don't see a significant change one way
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.680]   or the other, regardless of the outcome
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.960]   of the presidential election.
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.800]   Is that the right understanding there?
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.640]   >> Yeah, I'd say that the work
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   at the agencies is going on.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.680]   You know, they're, you know, we've been meeting regularly,
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.680]   going through questions, we're working
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.360]   through the various state agencies.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.640]   So no, I'd say that the work is continuing
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:18.360]   at the, as you say, the bureaucrat level.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.520]   >> Okay, awesome.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.160]   Thanks so much.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:21.960]   >> You're welcome.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.040]   >> Thanks Paul.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.680]   Next question is from Mike Weinstein
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.720]   from Credit Suisse.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.360]   Good morning Mike.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.800]   >> Hey, good morning.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.360]   Morning Phil.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.160]   >> Good morning Mike.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:33.960]   >> All right, good.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.520]   I hope you're doing well.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.600]   Hey, maybe you could just give a quick two second update
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.840]   on what you think the outcome at FERC might be
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.800]   for transmission ROEs and, you know, considering,
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.240]   I don't know if the election outcome maybe has any effect
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.920]   on any of this accelerating an outcome.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.280]   >> Well Mike, that's a very big crystal ball
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.360]   that you're asking me.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.960]   So, but again, thanks and I hope you're doing well.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.520]   Thanks for your question.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.960]   You know, it's, I wish I had a, you know,
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.080]   a better answer than to say that, you know,
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.560]   it's working its way through.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.440]   We don't really have a specific clarity
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.720]   as to when FERC might, you know, come up with something
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.480]   on the New England before pending New England cases
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.680]   and certainly impact of the election, one way or the other,
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.200]   what that could have in terms of commissioners
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.120]   and that type of thing.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.120]   So, you know, the only thing I know
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:48.560]   for certain is we're looking at our 10.57 rates
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:55.160]   and I'm deserving to that level and an 11.74 cap
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.160]   and, you know, we'll just have to wait and see
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.120]   when the final outcome we'll look at,
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.360]   but I don't really have any answer.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.840]   I know in years past when I tried to think
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.440]   that one was coming or it was going a certain way,
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.400]   it really hasn't materialized so I think it's best to wait
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:20.200]   for the final order comes out at this point or orders as it may be.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:25.160]   >> Right. And a bigger crystal ball question would be,
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.520]   you know, I know that Hydro Quebec has a pretty big long-term
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.240]   construction plan for, you know, hydro generation up there
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.000]   and I know that their long-term plans included lots
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.760]   and lots of northern past type transmission lines.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.760]   You know, do you think there's ever a time
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:46.000]   at some point where there might be another whack
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.440]   or another go at transmission
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.080]   at some point, you know, a big transmission project?
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.440]   >> I think a lot of that is dependent
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.720]   upon what the states want to get, right?
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.480]   So, these are going to be processes now that are driven
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.880]   by states clean energy policies and the states desire
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:11.080]   to have either offshore wind or solar or hydro in the mix
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:16.520]   so, you know, there are certainly, there's a lot of activity
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.800]   at the states now, I mean the states
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:24.880]   in our area all want aggressive carbon reduction targets
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.080]   so we wouldn't be asking the question to see a state,
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.880]   you know, want to, you know, contract for more of that
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.960]   but there's nothing planned on our end.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.880]   There's nothing that I see at this stage on the states agenda
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.880]   that would say that but when you say the word ever,
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.680]   you know, that's a long time.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.000]   >> So, it seems like the offshore wind program really is kind
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.960]   of supplanted that, at least at the time being.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:55.640]   >> Yeah, I think that's a good way of looking at it.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.160]   >> Okay, great, thank you very much.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.800]   >> Okay, thanks Mike.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.600]   Our next question is from Insu Kim from Goldman Sachs.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.640]   Good morning Insu.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.960]   >> Good morning guys.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.600]   My only question is and apologies if I miss this
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.880]   but could you give just an update on the Connecticut grid mark filings
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.600]   and any updates on expected decisions from the Commission
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.240]   and, you know, timing of investments, et cetera.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.480]   >> Thanks for your question Insu and I hope you
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.880]   and your family are doing well.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:30.360]   You didn't miss it, I mentioned, you know,
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.080]   in terms of what items could be additive to our five
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.160]   to seven percent core business growth rate I alluded
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.680]   to grid mark in Connecticut or New Hampshire
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:49.400]   or potentially additional AMI dockets in Massachusetts
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.240]   but there's really been no change there we,
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:57.800]   all the parties filed comments and plans back in July
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.160]   and certainly you can understand there's been a lot,
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.280]   there's been a lot going on and I think I may have said East IEAS was
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.960]   in October but we all know that East IEAS was in August.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:13.440]   So since August there's been a lot of, you know,
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.560]   there's been a lot of focus on storms and there's been a lot
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.040]   of dockets and as somebody else mentioned we have dockets going
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.760]   on in terms of moratoriums and whatnot.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.640]   So this, you know, the expectation was there was going
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:32.520]   to be another sort of go round and another process
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.760]   in Connecticut towards the end of the year.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.320]   I really haven't seen anything
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:41.480]   that would indicate specific schedule, you know, on that
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.840]   so I guess our best guess is still, you know,
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:48.840]   it's still in the pipeline and you may see more activity
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.360]   on grid lines there in Connecticut
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.760]   as we move over the next several months.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:59.560]   But in terms of being in our forecast, you know,
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:04.080]   I want to be clear that there is currently no, you know, zero,
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:08.400]   there's no grid line spending in our capital forecast
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.840]   for any, you know, grid line programs
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.720]   that haven't been approved like in Connecticut or New Hampshire.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.280]   So, you know, once they are approved
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:23.080]   and once we see what our role would be in them and once we see
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.280]   what that, you know, looks like then we have more confidence
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.880]   in putting it in the plan.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.680]   So that could be something we have information on
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.000]   by the time we get to the February update.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:41.120]   So, you know, we'll have to stay tuned on that.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   >> That makes sense.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:42.920]   That's all I had.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.600]   Thank you guys and stay safe.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.760]   >> All right, you do.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.520]   Thank you too.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.920]   Next question is from David Arkaro
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.040]   from Morgan Stanley.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.920]   Morning David.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.200]   Good morning, hi Jeff, hi Phil.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.160]   Thanks so much for taking my question.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.920]   >> Thanks.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:01.280]   >> And a quick follow-up on offshore wind, you know,
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.240]   in light of some of the recent delays,
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.560]   I was wondering if that changes how you're strategizing
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:11.120]   around other bids that you're putting into future RFPs,
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.440]   like baking in more contingency,
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.080]   anything that might give a greater level of comfort
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:20.640]   around the economic future project that you might win.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:26.440]   >> Thank you David for your comment and I hope you're doing well.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:31.280]   Certainly, every piece of information that you get,
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.240]   you know, and this isn't just offshore wind, you know,
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.520]   this is, you know, on all our business,
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.360]   but I'll focus on offshore wind since that's the question.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.960]   You know, every month it goes by, every quarter it goes by,
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:48.520]   we gain more insight and information about construction,
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:53.880]   about, you know, rates, about, you know,
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.800]   lots of factors, if all of those things,
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.880]   all of those things are factored into subsequent bids,
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.600]   so the information that we have available to us, you know,
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:07.720]   as we're moving into a bid, recent bid in New York is different
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.680]   than we had from bids that we made, you know,
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.920]   in Rhode Island or Connecticut or Massachusetts.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.720]   So every data point is important to us
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.920]   and we factor that into the next bid.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:25.120]   So I'd say that absolutely that schedules and how you make it
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:30.760]   through the citing process and all of that informs, you know,
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.120]   subsequent bids and so I can assure you
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.480]   that all those things get, you know,
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.240]   up to the minute attention before bid goes in.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.560]   >> Okay, got it.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.040]   That's helpful and I just wanted to touch on,
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.640]   just O&M costs and the O&M budget,
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.640]   could you remind us how you see that trajectory just
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.480]   for the overall business going forward?
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.080]   You've got a great track record of controlling O&M,
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:04.640]   so what are the key levers in your tool belt that you would focus
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:08.720]   on going forward for managing O&M?
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:13.880]   >> You know, we've got people processing technology, right,
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.640]   so all those things are levers to help, you know,
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.920]   our capital program as well as our operating program.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:28.200]   So, you know, we continue to implement systems and technology
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:32.520]   that improves processes that makes it more effective,
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.160]   you know, efficient and effective workforce.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:41.520]   So we have, you know, still a robust I'd say series
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.200]   of technology improvements.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:48.640]   If you, if you, I'll start off by just setting the space,
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.680]   in the guidance we gave we said that we expected O&M costs
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.160]   to be, you know, down this year and then just
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:00.720]   for the forecast period kind of flat going forward.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.280]   So how are we able to do that?
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.080]   It is by some of these technology changes
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:11.360]   and we've been implementing more productivity management tools
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:14.320]   and tools for our, you know, individual line workers
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.280]   and gas bidders and in the field to get their work,
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.160]   to update their work that we can then take that
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.000]   and automatically update drawings and files,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.880]   we don't need, you know, to hand it off to somebody.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.960]   So there's still these productivity technology changes
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.040]   that are happening some went in last year, some going
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.480]   in this year and more planned for next.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:44.760]   So that will be, I'd say the lever, the underpinning for us
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.320]   to have the ability to continue to improve processes
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:53.960]   and take unneeded costs out of the business.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.000]   >> Okay great, that's helpful.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.880]   Thanks so much for the call.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.400]   >> You're welcome.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.760]   >> Thank you David.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:03.160]   Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.720]   Morning Travis.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.760]   >> Good morning, thank you.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.960]   Quick clarification on the storm cost,
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:14.360]   that $275 million number if I heard you correctly,
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.120]   how much did you expense in the quarter
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.840]   and how much was either deferred or capitalized
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:27.320]   or will be pending the regulatory filing that you mentioned?
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:32.640]   >> Travis, that amount that you repeated was deferred,
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:36.320]   that's how much of a storm cost that we deferred
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:40.920]   in for tropical storm ethias
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:46.520]   and that was across all states but primarily in Connecticut.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:49.440]   So that's our deferral, that would be, you know,
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:54.040]   once the storm gets to a certain level it triggers a deferral.
[00:59:54.040 --> 01:00:00.080]   So we, that all is deferred storm cost right now.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.200]   In terms of, there are other storms, certainly we had,
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.520]   we had an active quarter for storms in general
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.920]   but there are other storms, other than ethias,
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.880]   that did impact the quarter.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.160]   I mean our storm costs were up, you know,
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.680]   about $10 million for the quarter
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.760]   that went through, you know, our O&M.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.760]   So for the quarter it's at that level
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:32.240]   and then the 274 or 5 that you mentioned is deferred across the system.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.800]   >> Okay, great, that's very helpful, thank you.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.200]   And then a quick follow-up to the discussion
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:41.080]   on the Connecticut legislation and there's some language in there
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.920]   as I understood it's about the general assembly having some
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.840]   review power there, what's your thought in terms of the scope
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.200]   of what the general assembly separate
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.200]   from Pura could do in terms of either taking back some earnings
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.240]   or rate changes, stuff like that,
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:04.080]   separate from what's going on in the Pura?
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.360]   >> Well certainly the general assembly can enact legislation
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:14.280]   that it feels is appropriate in any matter so, you know,
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.120]   I do think specifically to the energy legislation
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:23.120]   that was enacted recently in Connecticut
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.920]   that most, you know, things all were, you know,
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.040]   for the most part moved to Pura, you know, so the regulator.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.920]   So I guess I'd look at it as the legislation would provide the intent,
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.840]   the framework, the direction and then Pura is the one
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.320]   who's going to be implementing, you know, they're going to be the ones
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.520]   who evaluate the performance-based rates.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:52.040]   They'll be the ones who initiate the storm, you know, standards
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.000]   and things like that and look at, you know,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.600]   should there be penalties or should there be food, you know,
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.200]   penalties and things like that so I think that effectively,
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.280]   you know, the general assembly can certainly enact any
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.520]   and all legislation it feels it should
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.400]   and the way that this legislation seems to have turned out was
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:23.080]   that the implementation of that legislation is in the hands of Pura.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.280]   >> OK, so the potential for any or the risk for any kind
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.160]   of clawbacks would likely go through Pura instead of going
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.320]   through the general assembly based on that cannot get legislation
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.480]   that you talked about, right?
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.400]   >> Yeah, as I say, you know, the Pura, the dockets are active
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.040]   and will be active over, you know,
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.200]   there's a certain time date that the legislation has given Pura
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.280]   so I would expect that Pura will have the pen on this.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.520]   But again, as I say, you know, legislation can always be enacted
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.840]   in any area.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.280]   >> Yep, yep, OK, great, appreciate.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.000]   >> All right, thank you Travis.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   Our next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.360]   Good morning, Andrew.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.400]   >> Hey, good morning.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.840]   Thanks for squeezing me in.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.800]   First question is, with the two rate cases now completed,
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.000]   can you remind us which subsidiaries might be next
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.680]   to file general rate cases?
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.640]   We have plenty of regulatory items, of course,
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.080]   with grid mod and other initiatives,
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.560]   but for general rate cases?
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.960]   >> Well, according to the requirements in Connecticut,
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:46.040]   Connecticut could be an area that is required to file
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.120]   by the existing framework that's there and that would be
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.400]   something that would be sort of a, you know, next year sort
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.880]   of event, but other than that, we're pretty much
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:03.280]   out of the regulatory arena.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.760]   >> OK, great.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.280]   Then on offshore wind, can you just thinking, sorry,
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.720]   can you share your latest thinking
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.720]   on how big you're willing to let that business get?
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.560]   You talked a lot about the opportunities
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.480]   that you're pursuing beyond the three existing projects.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.560]   Any thinking as far as from an earnings mix perspective
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.360]   if there's a limitation or will you plan
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.520]   to just bid, bid, bid and get as many projects
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.120]   as your leases will support?
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.240]   >> Well, I want to be clear on this because I think
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:39.160]   it's a very important point that bid-bid isn't that strategy.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.280]   Our strategy is to have a financial discipline
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.080]   about growing that business in a way
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.280]   that provides appropriate levels of return
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.720]   that benefit our shareholders.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.320]   So just by winning a bid, you know, doesn't do it.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.880]   It has to be, we have to and we continue
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.560]   to maintain financial discipline in terms
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.800]   of the amounts that we bid and the return that we're looking for.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.920]   So as long as the returns are at an appropriate level
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.800]   for that business, it makes sense to make the bid,
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.880]   win the bid and expand the business there.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:25.520]   What we've said is our tracks, what we own off the coast
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.600]   of what we have access to in terms of the lease area,
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.080]   you know, we could do about 4,000,
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.480]   at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.000]   So there's kind of a, you know,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.360]   that's the maximum capability that we have
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.400]   so it's not an infinite growth type of thing
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.360]   and we had indicated that when leases were available
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.480]   that they're not in our region
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.560]   and we were not interested in them.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.240]   So leases in our region, like the ones we're involved in
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:01.440]   are good, but on the lease area, you know, that's not for us,
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.320]   you know, the parts of the mid-Atlantic, et cetera.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.760]   So we're constrained by the lease area and we're guided
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:16.480]   by the financial discipline on our bids and our returns.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.520]   >> God, if that's really helpful,
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.440]   I guess I should have said bid, bid, bid responsibly.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.800]   >> Okay, well, yeah.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.320]   >> Thanks a lot guys.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.880]   I hope you stay well on your thing.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.440]   >> All right, Andrew, thank you very much.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.440]   That sort of wraps up today.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.040]   If you have any follow-up questions, please give us a call
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.360]   or send us an e-mail and we look forward to speaking
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:45.600]   and seeing many of you during the virtual EEI conference next week.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.560]   >> And thank you ladies and gentlemen,
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.080]   this concludes today's conference.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.280]   Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.160]   >> Thank you.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.120]   >> All right, thank you.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SAG 3rd Quarter 2020 Earnings
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.320]   Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.840]   conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at the time. If anyone
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.640]   should require assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your touchstone
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.400]   telephone. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Thank you. I would like
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.680]   to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Brandon Freight. Please go ahead.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.240]   Thank you, Grace. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review SAG's 3rd
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.840]   Quarter 2020 financial results. On the call today, we have Krista Herm, Chief Executive
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.740]   Officer and Taylor Smith, Chief Financial Officer. Following Chris and Taylor's prepared comments,
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.820]   we will open the call for a question and answer session. Our 3rd Quarter Earnings Press Release
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.560]   was issued today after the market closed at approximately 4.05 p.m. Eastern Time. As a
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.960]   follow-on to the Earnings Release, we published a supplemental financial information on our
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.840]   Investor Relations website. We also furnished this document to the SEC Enformer. You can
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.720]   find all our Earnings documents on our Investor Relations website at SAG.com in the quarterly
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.680]   results section under the Financials tab. We are recording this call and a broadcast of
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.760]   the conference call will be archived at the SAG Investor Relations webpage under the Events
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.040]   tab for one year. Before we begin, we would like to remind everyone that the prepared
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.520]   remarks contain forward-looking statements and management may make additional forward-looking
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.480]   statements in response to your questions. These statements include, but are not limited to,
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.040]   our outlook for the company and statements that estimate or project future results of
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.040]   operations for the performance of the company. These statements do not guarantee future performance
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.200]   and speak as of the date hereof. For more detailed discussion on the factors that can
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.280]   cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.000]   we refer all of you to the risk factors contained in SAG's annual report on Form 10(k) and quarterly
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.920]   reports on Form 10(q) by the Securities and Exchange Commission. SAG assumes no obligation
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.120]   to revise any forward-looking statements that may be made in today's release or call.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.640]   Please note that on today's call, in addition to discussing the GAP financial results,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.080]   we will discuss the adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP financial measure. Explanation of SAG's use
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.400]   of this non-GAAP financial measure in this call and reconciliation between GAP and non-GAAP
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.040]   measures required by SEC Regulation G is included in SAG's press release today, which again can
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.200]   be found on the Investor Relations website. The non-GAAP information is not a substitute
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.600]   for any performance measure derived in accordance with GAP, and the use of such non-GAAP measures
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.640]   has limitations, which are detailed in the company's press release.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.360]   Now I begin the call over to Krista Herman. Krista?
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.240]   Thanks Brendan, and thank you to everyone on today's call. We hope you and your families
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.960]   continue to be safe and healthy. Firstly, let me start by thanking our entire SAG team across
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.360]   the globe. I am extremely plowed to see how our teams reacted through the quarter and
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.600]   never last sight of serving our consumers and partners with quality products that protect
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.400]   and enhance their devices. Over the course of the third quarter, it was pleasing to see
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.980]   our results improve significantly compared with the second quarter and exceed our expectations.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.480]   We are encouraged by our recent performance given the challenges we continue to face from
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.640]   the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy. Our work over the past several
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.320]   months, which has included reducing expenses, adapting our operations to the current retail
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   environment and aggressively managing inventories has put the company in a much stronger financial
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.360]   position and provided the business with good momentum as we head into our busiest selling
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.040]   season. Looking at our third quarter in more detail, as we discussed on our Q2 call in August,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.800]   we saw a significant sequential uptick in sales through in June for both our protection and
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.640]   power categories as several of our larger customers reopened our doors and resumed more normalized
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.100]   store operations, with some sales through weeks even exceeding last year's levels. This trend
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.600]   continued into July and consistently improved throughout August and September. While our
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.400]   online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced earlier in the pandemic, when
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.520]   much of the brick and mortar was closed, it was still up nicely from a year ago and expanding
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.880]   this channel continues to be a priority for us. With respect to our overall performance,
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.080]   Q3 revenue came in at $150 million compared to $147 million in the year ago period, a decrease
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.680]   of 21%. This represents a nice improvement from the 28% year-over-year decrease in revenue
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.920]   we reported in the second quarter. Despite the roughly $32 million drop in revenue compared
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.180]   with the third quarter last year, combined with some gross margin headwinds from higher
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.520]   freight expenses, we delivered adjusted EBITDA up $15 million. Thanks to cost saving measures
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.440]   we enacted early in the pandemic. Taylor will go through in greater detail on the balance
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.080]   sheet, but I wanted to share a few highlights. Despite significant market pressure from
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.700]   COVID-19, our account receivable, DSO has improved compared to last year, inventory declined compared
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.360]   to where we ended Q2, we generated positive operating cash flow and we continued to reduce
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.600]   our quarterly net debt balance on a year-over-year and sequential basis. By taking quick decisive
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.120]   action back in April and more recently working closely with our retail partners under store
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.640]   reopening efforts, we have been able to successfully navigate through incredibly challenging market
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.380]   conditions, ensuring the financial viability of the company and position ourselves to exit
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.520]   these difficult periods as a stronger more nimble organization and now provide some additional
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.720]   color to our categories. Starting with protection, we continue to build on our overall digital
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.200]   wellness strategy. For a few years now our hero screen protector has been VisionGuard, a
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.080]   product that reduced exposure to high energy visible blue light that can have damaging
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.720]   effects without changing the screen colors or the peak resolution. We have now sold over
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.480]   10 million units with this technology. In addition, all invisible machine screen protectors produced
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.740]   this year and beyond now also include antimicrobial technology. This includes our entire lineup
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.320]   for the new iPhone 12 which is now available in stores. Earlier this year we introduced
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.360]   our newest product geared towards our digital wellness strategy, a UV phone sanitizer which
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:17.060]   works with all mobile devices and kills up to 99.9% of staff in E. coli surface bacteria.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.840]   Our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retailers and our
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.480]   consumers and has led to increasing sales through and greater shelf space with many of our accounts.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.440]   We've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to protect cases with good success starting
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.180]   with the Samsung Galaxy S20 launch earlier this year and right through to the recent iPhone
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:44.320]   12 launch. All Gear 4 protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology. The combination
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.120]   of disenhancement benefit and Gear 4's differential D3O impact technology is driving excitement
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.640]   amongst consumers especially as awareness of the brand and products grow from our efforts
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.520]   to expand distribution. With the new iPhone 12 Gear 4 is now available and growing across
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.080]   all of our carrier partners. This expanded distribution accelerates to momentum Gear 4 brand and I'm
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   excited to see it continue to grow through 2021. In our poll category Mofi launched many exciting
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.800]   new products during Q3 including the introduction of a new line of wireless charging solutions.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.300]   These innovations are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.360]   devices in one central location. In addition last month we launched a new Mofi juice pack
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.640]   connect. This new product represents an evolution of our popular juice pack allowing users to
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.080]   easily charge their phone on demand using a detachable battery feature that is not device
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.560]   specific and is used with or without the consumers normal phone case.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.520]   Our Halo brand continues to perform well on QVC which has been a productive partnership
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.080]   and channel particularly given the number of consumers spending more time at home. Q4 is
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.960]   a busy time for our brand for QVC and HSN with a number of earrings planned during the holiday
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.440]   period. Looking ahead with the majority of our US partner doors now open and weekly sales
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.080]   will continue to improve combined with solid direct to consumer trends we feel optimistic
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.240]   about our prospects for the remainder of the year. While there's still a good deal of uncertainty
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.640]   about how the virus will impact shopping behavior this holiday season including the effect on
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.920]   several countries in Europe that have recently implemented lockdowns we believe we are well
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.320]   positioned to capitalize on demand regardless of which channel our consumers choose to engage
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.800]   with the brands. We are currently planning four quarter revenue to increase from third quarter
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.080]   levels and continue improving on the year over year declines we have experienced the past
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.400]   two quarters even as we are facing tough comparisons in last year's record Q4 sales.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.920]   I am confident the long-term course we have set for the company our efforts around antimicrobial
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.720]   UV sanitization and blue light protection are driven by our belief that consumers will increasingly
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.600]   look for solutions that will henge their digital wellness. We also believe another consumer
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.920]   priority will be increased productivity and comfort from home. We will continue our focus
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.160]   on enhancing technology in our lives to accomplish these growing needs. While it remains difficult
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.180]   to know when conditions will fully normalize and what impact COVID-19 will have on the global
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.520]   economy and our industry I am confident that we have taken the right steps to emerge from
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.680]   the pandemic as a stronger company. This includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.080]   product and categories and simplify our core lines of business. As a more nimble company
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.520]   Zach can better serve its retail partners and core consumers capitalize on the tailwinds
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.320]   from the multi year rollout of 5G with the margin benefits from our branding category
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.640]   consolidation and generate increased value for our shareholders. I will now hand the call
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:38.240]   over to Tanner. Thanks Chris. Since many details of our quarterly financial performance were
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.520]   included in the supplemental financial information issued earlier today I would just like to take
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.240]   a few minutes to add some additional comments on our third quarter financial performance.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:55.280]   Q3 net sales decreased year over year by approximately 21% to $115 million. After exiting a very difficult
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.600]   second quarter we saw good momentum throughout the third quarter as retail outlets continued
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.120]   to reopen and allow a more normal in store shopping experience. That being said the residual effects
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.160]   of COVID-19 combined with the delay of the launch of the new Apple devices which pushed
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.240]   some orders into Q4 made it a difficult year over year compare. Overall we are pleased
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.160]   with the momentum and sell through improvements we saw at retail which enabled us to increase
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:26.480]   sales by almost 50% on a consecutive quarter basis from $77 million to $115 million. Q3
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.880]   gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased year over year to 33%. There were a number of
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.400]   puts and takes that impacted gross profit during the quarter including a benefit from net lower
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.360]   duty rates and expected duty refunds which I will discuss in more detail in a second. This
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:47.600]   benefit was offset by higher expedited air freight and increased air freight rates along
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.520]   with the sale of excess inventory at margins that were lower than our historical averages.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.000]   On the subject of duty refunds, in early August we received an exclusion notice that duties
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.320]   paid on certain products imported from China starting in late 2018 may be subject to refund.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.960]   We worked closely with our customs broker to begin submitting refund documentation to U.S.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.440]   Customs. This work is ongoing and given the volume of imports from China since late 2018
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.760]   we'll continue throughout the fourth quarter. Based on the work completed to date we recorded
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.240]   a refund receivable at quarter end of approximately $5.4 million for duties paid that we expect
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.440]   to be refunded. The income statement impacted this receivable offset by the balance sheet reduction
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.280]   from duties previously capitalized in inventory and then sold in Q3 2020 was a net income statement
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.400]   benefit of $1.7 million or approximately 140 basis points to gross profit margin during
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.000]   the quarter. As I mentioned there is still quite a bit of work left to do during the
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.320]   fourth quarter to complete our remaining refund submissions and we'll provide an update
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:54.240]   on any additional refund upside on our next call. Q3 operating expenses decreased 29% or
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.800]   approximately $12 million compared to last year. The decrease was due primarily to the
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:04.280]   various cost cutting measures we implemented as a result of the expected COVID-19 impacts
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.500]   on demand. Over the last several months we've made the conscious decision to bring some
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.560]   individuals back from furlough to support fourth quarter product launches and customer care
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.940]   but we continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:24.380]   time. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million versus 21 million in the prior year period. The decline
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.600]   versus last year is linked to decrease sales and reduction in overall gross profit margin
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.880]   for the reasons I mentioned. These items were offset by the decreases in operating expenses
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.920]   that I just discussed. Turning to the balance sheet compared to a year ago accounts receivable
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:44.600]   decreased 33% to $91 million due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.080]   However, our DSOs improved significantly from 87 days to 73 days. The quality of our receivables
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.760]   remains very good. Inventory was $80 million compared to $94 million at the end of the
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.940]   first quarter, a reduction of approximately $14 million. During the third quarter we took
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.320]   a conservative approach to inventory as we closely monitored retail sell through, customer
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.920]   forecasts and customer inventory levels to ensure we didn't overextend on inventory purchasing.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.680]   As a result we did incur some incremental expedited air freight charges due to increased demand
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.760]   at the end of the third quarter as retail sell through improved. At this point we will continue
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.100]   to closely monitor the factors that influence our purchasing forecasts but we'll continue
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:30.160]   to plan conservatively due to the continued uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.340]   At the continued headwinds from COVID-19 during the quarter we generated a third quarter operating
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:39.520]   cash flow of approximately $9 million compared to -11 million in cash from operations during
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:46.160]   the prior year period. Net debt which is consolidated debt less cash decreased to $81 million compared
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:52.820]   to $97 million in Q3 last year and $85 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. As
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.000]   we discussed on the last call during April we amended our credit facility to increase
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   the total amount available under the line of credit from $125 million to $145 million. This
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.200]   expansion combined with the loan received under the CARES Act the Q2 restructuring and cost
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.240]   counting initiatives we've undertaken gives us confidence that we'll successfully navigate
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.840]   the headwinds the COVID-19 has put on the business. The capital allocation focus throughout the
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.800]   remainder of 2020 will remain on funding working capital needs and continuing to service our
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.280]   line of credit. As we look to the fourth quarter of 2020 we definitely have better visibility
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.080]   now than we did when we last spoke in August. However COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.000]   around worldwide retail demand. Given this market uncertainty we will not be providing annual
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.880]   guidance at this time. However given our current view of customer orders and positive retail
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.400]   sell-through trends we expect strong sequential net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth over the
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.920]   third quarter. We expect 2020 year to take gross margins to improve during the fourth quarter.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.360]   Though as I mentioned we'll see some pressure over the next few quarters compared to historical
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.760]   averages of mid 30s as we sell through our excess inventory. We expect total operating
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.560]   expenses to be in the same range of high 20s to low 30 million dollars for the fourth quarter.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.360]   No different than for many other companies COVID-19 has been extremely disruptive to our
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.320]   business. However with the steps we've taken to restructure the business reduce fixed costs
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.920]   and insuradical liquidity I'm confident the likes of this period impacted by COVID-19 is
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.540]   a much stronger company than when we entered. With that we will now open up the call for
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:32.080]   questions. Thank you ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.440]   start in the number one key on your touchstone telephone. Again that is start in the number
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.760]   one key on your touchstone telephone. Your first question comes from the line of Elliot
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:49.280]   Alper from DA Davidson your line is open. Great thank you. Thanks for the info on just the sequential
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.920]   sales in the fourth quarter I guess. Could you talk about any trends quarter date specifically
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:00.520]   and specifically geographic sales mix or you seeing any material changes with sales and
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.680]   geographies that have lost restrictions compared to those that have more? Yeah just a couple
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:12.280]   of notes you know with the Apple launch happening a little bit later than we had experienced
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:18.880]   previously there was maybe five million dollars of sales that shifted from Q3 into Q4 which
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   obviously benefit kind of the sequential look at revenue. Overall though we're seeing really
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:32.600]   good sell through of the phones that seem to be doing very successful in market and obviously
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:39.760]   we're benefiting from that so Q4 starting off really really well. In terms of geos no material
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:46.640]   change in geo expansion Chris mentioned or geo mix Chris mentioned on his and his prepared
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.000]   remarks that we are definitely seeing some headwinds at least in terms of shutdowns in
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.280]   some of our international locations. However the wireless dealers in those locations have
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.040]   been deemed as essential and so those have remained open and so kind of remains to be seen as to
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:08.080]   how that's going to impact demand but I think overall we're definitely seeing some strong
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:14.360]   signs that we're kind of getting back to a more normal Q4 experience though obviously
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:23.240]   COVID remains a bit of a cloud over everything. Okay great and then aside from the Apple launch
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.520]   shifting into the fourth quarter can you talk about the holiday season and kind of what
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.280]   may be different this year versus historically and kind of any implications that may have
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.720]   on the December quarter. Yeah the one thing that we are starting to see is obviously the
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.000]   Black Friday seems to be more some retailers are taking strategy we're just spreading us
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.600]   out over a number of days over the month so that's something that's going to be different
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:52.800]   I think we're still going to see a pretty strong online attachment from both side dot com and
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:59.600]   obviously through Amazon. But we're very I would say optimistic about the sell through
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.840]   the early sales through on our screen protection and cases are quite strong and that's given
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.240]   that we still have a number of other devices to take the market actually this week so
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:17.520]   overall I think we have some good runway for the holiday season Elliot. Okay great thank
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:25.440]   you. Thank you. Thanks Elliot. And once again in order to ask a question please press start
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.640]   then the number one on your touch down telephone. Your next question comes from the line of
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:36.400]   Matt Dean from Titan Capital Management your line is open. Great thank you. I was hoping you
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.320]   could put a number on the expediting shipping cost that you incurred in the third quarter
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:48.560]   just to give us some better idea how much housing can those work. Yeah it was between two and
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:55.120]   three million dollars and you know as I mentioned in my prepared remarks you know we really it
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.640]   was a bit of a balancing act with inventory where we're trying to run it down and you know
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.260]   as sell through picked up at the end you know we did have to move quickly and unfortunately
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:09.520]   resulted in some some expedited air freight charges. And for the fourth quarter are you
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.840]   expecting that to reoccur or is it have you caught up and you feel like you're in a better
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:22.000]   place now. Yeah it's a great question you know I think we're still probably chasing a little
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.960]   bit of demand you know the one thing that's also kind of impacted us no different than
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.000]   every other company that's importing from overseas is just generally freight rates have increased
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.600]   kind of globally and so that's that's also impacted but I think there's probably going to be a little
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.560]   bit of that you know as I mentioned it's a bit of a balancing act we definitely wanted to
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.880]   be careful you know given the pandemic and how much inventory we were planning and you
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.560]   know fortunately or unfortunately we've seen some some upsides which is great but we've
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.420]   had to chase those and so I think we're probably still chasing a little bit which will impact
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:02.920]   some of our Q4 sales and then also obviously the spend on freight. Great. Also wanted to
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:08.200]   ask if I could really quickly about the tariff situation and now with the Biden presidency
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:16.400]   I know you've been moving some production out of China does that change your view on moving
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.880]   production out of China or how are you thinking about this new regime? Yeah I think Matt it
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:30.000]   doesn't change our strategy ultimately we're looking to diversify across our CM base and
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.400]   make sure that we're setting the company up for continued business so we're still following
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.720]   the strategy you know we've had a very good quarter where we've now successfully have piloted
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.800]   both screen protection and wireless power outside of China so it gives us that ability to be
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:52.280]   able to shift our supply chain when needed. Obviously China still a big part of our strategy
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:57.160]   but what I like is we're not just looking at it from a tariff perspective now we're really
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:06.940]   looking at it from a business continuity perspective. Great thank you both. Thanks Matt. Thanks Matt.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:21.440]   Thank you once again in order to ask a question please press start in the number one on your
