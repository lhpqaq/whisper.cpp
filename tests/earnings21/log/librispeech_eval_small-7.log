[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monroe INX Earnings Conference Call
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.840]   for the third quarter fiscal 2020.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.600]   At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.960]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960]   time.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.600]   If anyone should require assistance during the call, please press star zero on your touch
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600]   tone phone.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.320]   As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded and may not be
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.720]   reproduced in whole or in part without permission from the company.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.460]   I would now like to introduce Ms. Maureen Mulholland, Senior Vice President, General
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.560]   Counsel and Secretary of Monroe.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.560]   Thank you.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   Please go ahead.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.560]   Thank you.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.040]   Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning's call.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.680]   Before we get started, please note that as part of the call this morning, we will be
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.140]   referencing a presentation that is available on the Investors section of our website at
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:02.080]   corporate.monroe.com/investors/investorresources.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.280]   If I could draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two of the presentation,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.600]   I'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.280]   statements about Monroe's future performance.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.240]   Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.060]   The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monroe's filings
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.960]   with the SEC and in our earnings release.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.320]   The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.560]   whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560]   law.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.840]   Additionally, on today's call, management statements include a discussion of certain non-gap financial
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.860]   measures, which are intended to supplement and not be substitutes for comparable gap measures.
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.200]   Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable gap measures will be included
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.600]   as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.480]   With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer,
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   Brett Ponton.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   Brett?
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.960]   Thank you, Maureen, and good morning, everyone.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.400]   I'll get started today with a brief overview of our third quarter results followed by an
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.720]   update on the progress we've made on our Monroe Forward Strategy.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.800]   As illustrated on slide three, we reported comps down 0.9 percent in the third quarter
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.360]   as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.000]   In October and the beginning of November, we performed well against difficult comparisons
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.840]   in the prior year.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.440]   All weather conditions towards the end of November and in December caused a slowdown
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.360]   across our core northern markets.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.720]   These conditions have continued into January, with our comparable store sales down 4 percent
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.680]   during the month.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.080]   We do not like talking about the weather; however, it is impossible to ignore the impact it has
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   on our business.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.360]   While we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter, we are executing well
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.320]   against the areas within our control.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.680]   In particular, we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and our confidence
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.760]   we are on the right path.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.000]   We are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   deliver strong results, no matter the external circumstances.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.560]   Moving on to our performance by category in the third quarter, we were down 1 percent
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.040]   year over year in tire comparable store sales.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.040]   As higher ticket year over year was offset by decline in tire volume.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.480]   We experienced more normalized retail pricing this quarter and are focused on further refining
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.920]   our tire strategy to drive strength in our largest category.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.040]   Importantly, we are on track to roll out our tire category management and pricing system
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.080]   beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.520]   approach to real-time pricing.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.080]   I'll provide more details on this shortly.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.600]   Turning to our service and repair categories, we saw a 3 percent decline in brakes year over
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.480]   year, falling short of a difficult comparison in the third quarter last year.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.720]   In maintenance, we were flat while front end shocks were down 1 percent and alignments
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.440]   decline 3 percent year over year.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.640]   Overall, our southern markets outperformed our northern markets as expected given the
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.840]   mild winter weather conditions we faced in this region.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.400]   New stores added $22.7 million in revenue during the quarter, including $20.7 million
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.880]   from recent acquisitions.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.960]   Regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter, we saw a decline of 20 basis
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.760]   points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.160]   sales, which resulted in higher fixed cost as the percentage of sales.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.320]   Our variable margin, on the other hand, expanded due to lower year over year material cost
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.880]   as the percentage of sales, while slightly higher than the prior year quarter technician
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.360]   labor as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.880]   This is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.000]   We identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.160]   action to drive improved results.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.280]   We will have additional opportunities to continue to improve results in this area as we implement
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.800]   our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.160]   which would be critical for us to seamlessly adjust the changes in demand dynamics without
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.800]   sacrifice and sales.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.280]   I'd now like to turn to the progress we've made in our Monroe Forward Strategy, beginning
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.880]   with our store rebrand and re-image initiative on slide four.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.080]   This initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.680]   standardized in-store operating procedures, which we call our Monroe Playbook.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.120]   Additionally, we are rebranding select stores to a tire-oriented spanner where targeted
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.720]   demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.080]   service revenues.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.480]   During the first half of fiscal 2020, we finalized the transformations of our first group of stores,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.880]   which includes 44 locations in Rochester, New York and Mid-Atlantic, as well as the second
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.200]   group, which includes 43 stores in our southern markets.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.600]   During the third quarter, we continue to scale this initiative across our base and move forward
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.760]   with the transformation of 74 stores in four markets and 42 of our recently acquired California
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.400]   stores.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.840]   We have completed the transformation of the 74 stores and have substantially completed
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   our California stores, which are being rebranded under our Tire Choice Auto Service Center
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.000]   spanner to drive higher awareness for tires.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.440]   Turning to slide five, I'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.160]   rationale as we transform our store base.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.480]   As many of you know, we operate in two store formats, our service brand stores, which generate
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.640]   approximately $600,000 per store in annualized sales, and our tire brand stores, which generate
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.040]   approximately $1.2 million per store in annualized sales.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.480]   Prior to any rebrand activity, we operate 555 service brand stores and 734 tire brand
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   stores.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.200]   As we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores, we are prioritizing
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.000]   the higher volume tire brand.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.920]   Throughout this process, we will be consolidating our regional brands, focusing on shifting
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.600]   our service brands over the tire brands.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.760]   The lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.680]   While we speak to re-imaging stores, this primarily means modernizing the appearance
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.960]   of our stores with no associated brand change.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.080]   As we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re-imaging stores, we are leveraging
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.520]   our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.240]   Looking at the bottom left of the slide, you can see here the progress we have made so
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   far.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.400]   We are very much in the early endings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.080]   completed out of our portfolio.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.680]   We separated these stores out between comp stores and non-comp stores, which helps us
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.960]   to evaluate their performance post-refresh.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.600]   Of our approximately 900 comp stores that we set out to transform, we have completed
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:49.280]   134 stores, and of our approximately 150 non-comp stores, we have substantially completed 69.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.120]   As we move forward with expanding this program across our base, we will continue to prioritize
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.200]   those markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.680]   our approach we measure in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.520]   Through the end of this fiscal year, we are focusing on finalizing the transformation
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.880]   of our recently acquired California stores while starting the transformation of approximately
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.440]   80 more stores that will be completed in Q1 of FY21.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.400]   Moving on to the performance of the stores we've completed so far to help provide some
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.720]   additional granularity, we've separated out how rebranded stores have performed versus
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.640]   the stores that have just been re-imaged.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.160]   Importantly, this data only includes comp stores that have had a full quarter of performance
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.240]   following the completion of their transformation.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:48.800]   This is how we will speak to this performance of our transformed stores moving forward.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.720]   As you can see, and in line with our expectations, we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   stores.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   This shift optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sales without sacrificing
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.840]   our service revenues.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.720]   The stores that have been re-imaged were slightly down as these are located in our northern
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.000]   markets, which were impacted by the mild weather conditions I mentioned earlier.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.120]   We believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.760]   to come with a streamlined brand portfolio.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.800]   The 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation, given
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.960]   they have not had a full quarter post transformation yet, but we are still seeing early signs of
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.560]   strength to these stores and are pleased with the results.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.880]   While we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base, the sustained
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.720]   performance we have seen at the stores that have completed the transformation today underscores
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.080]   the impact of this important initiative.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.320]   Turning to slide 6 and the remainder of our Monroe Forward initiatives, I would like
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.600]   to focus my discussion on the initiatives that are top priority, which we believe will
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.760]   be critical to supporting our broader strategy.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.600]   In a third quarter, we began modernizing our store IT infrastructure at all of our approximately
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.040]   1,300 locations.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.560]   This new infrastructure enables state-of-the-art technology, including our new digital phone
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.600]   and texting system, which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.120]   This system will allow us to better track customer execution, driving a more consistent
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.720]   phone strategy, and improved conversion.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.480]   Our store infrastructure modernization will be completed by the end of the first quarter
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.840]   of fiscal 2021, allowing us to leverage our new phone system, which will be critical to
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.040]   driving traffic to our stores.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.360]   Another priority for us is the optimization of our entire category management.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.600]   We are on track, and by the end of this fiscal year, we expect our new pricing software will
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.240]   be operational.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.440]   We believe this will be critical to driving long-term margin expansion by providing improved
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.040]   visibility into demand dynamics, allowing us to better refine our assortments, and execute
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.840]   our strategy to become the number one destination for tires at any price point.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.240]   Finally, we are right on track to roll out our cloud-based store scheduling model pilot
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   by year-end.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.600]   Gaining real-time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.320]   and strategic, ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales or overstaffed when there
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.360]   is a lack of demand.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.400]   Regarding our other teammate initiatives, we have rolled out the Monroe University Program
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.720]   to all of our teammates and are continuing to expand and enhance the course content.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.560]   We have also implemented mandatory onboard training to ensure that everyone who joins
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:51.200]   our team is trained on our Monroe playbook operating procedures in order to provide a
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.080]   quality five-star experience to our customers.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.000]   Moving on to slide seven, while we are very focused on the rollout of Monroe Forward, acquisitions
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.240]   remain a cornerstone of our gross strategy.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.800]   During the quarter, we closed the previously announced acquisitions of three companies,
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.080]   one with 14 locations in Las Vegas, Nevada, and four in Boise, Idaho, as well as two companies
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.320]   that include nine stores in Northern California, further solidifying our growing position in
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.480]   the Western United States.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.960]   Our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts as well as benefit
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:31.040]   from the high concentration of vehicles in this market and the potential long-term consumer
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.080]   shift to ride sharing.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.920]   The acquisition in Nevada and Idaho, which are new states to Monroe, is expected to add
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.960]   approximately 20 million in annualized sales, represented sales mix of 75 percent service
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.120]   and 25 percent tires.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.560]   The acquisitions in California are expected to add approximately 25 million in annualized
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.420]   sales, represented sales mix of 55 percent service and 45 percent tires.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:04.000]   These acquisitions are expected to be diluted to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.120]   Overall acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.560]   120 million in annualized sales.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.920]   We operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.160]   and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.760]   M&A targets.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.960]   We currently have over 10 NDA signs with opportunities ranging from five to 40 stores, which we believe
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.480]   will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.640]   expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.080]   Further, by continuing to execute our Monroe Forward initiatives, including our new brand
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.720]   standards and operating procedures, we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.880]   and efficiently.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:00.560]   Lastly, we open one greenfield location during third quarter, bringing our total greenfield
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.240]   store openings to seven in fiscal 2020.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.320]   In conclusion, we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.640]   our business.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.680]   We are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.480]   a platform capable of delivering sustainable, long-term growth.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.920]   We are not there yet, nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.840]   transformation, but we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business,
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.080]   make any appropriate course corrections when necessary, and executing well against the
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.320]   areas within our control.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.120]   I'd like to thank the entire team at Monroe for their exceptional work as we execute this
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.760]   strategy, as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.880]   With that, I'll turn the call over to our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.560]   and Treasurer, Brian Deembrosia, who will provide additional detail on our third quarter
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.440]   financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.840]   Thank you, Brett, and good morning, everyone.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.080]   Turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter, sales increased 6.2 percent
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:15.680]   year-over-year to $329.3 million, driven by sales from new stores of $22.7 million, including
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:22.880]   $20.7 million from recent acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.040]   of approximately $0.8 million.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.080]   Same-store sales in the quarter were down 0.9 percent year-over-year.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:37.480]   The third quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days in line with the previous year period.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:43.000]   Growth margin decreased 20 basis points to 37.8 percent in the third quarter of fiscal
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.200]   2020 from 38 percent in the prior year period.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.600]   This decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.680]   of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:04.240]   However, as Brett mentioned, we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.160]   costs as a percentage of sales.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:14.560]   Operating expenses for the quarter increased $5.5 million to $92.8 million, or 28.2 percent
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:21.440]   of sales, as compared with $87.3 million, or 28.1 percent of sales for the prior year
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.680]   period.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.920]   The year-over-year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net news stores.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:35.440]   Our operating income for the third quarter was $31.6 million, which increased by 2.8
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.800]   percent as compared to operating income of $30.7 million for the same quarter last year
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:48.000]   and decreased as a percentage of sales from 9.9 percent to 9.6 percent.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.200]   That interest expense for the third quarter increased $0.2 million to $7 million as compared
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.920]   to $6.8 million in the same period last year.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.160]   The weighted average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.240]   approximately $112 million as compared to the prior year period.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.600]   The increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease debt recorded in connection
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.920]   with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions and green field expansion, as well as an increase in
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:24.440]   debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisition.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.520]   The weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:34.040]   140 basis points year-over-year due to lower LIBOR and prime interest rates, as well as
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.960]   lower borrowing rates associated with new leases.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.640]   Our effective tax rate was 24.1 percent for the third quarter compared to 15.3 percent
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.680]   for the same period last year.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:51.960]   The year-over-year increase is primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit adjustment
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.280]   we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change, which
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.920]   was related to certain deductions that the IRS accepted during the examination of our
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.320]   fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 tax returns.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:13.720]   That income for the third quarter was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the prior
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.320]   year period.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.400]   Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 56 cents compared to diluted
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.400]   earnings per share of 61 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.520]   Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is a non-gap measure, for the third quarter
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.800]   of fiscal 2020 was 60 cents, which excludes from diluted earnings per share three cents
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.720]   of costs related to Monroe Forward Initiatives and one cent of costs related to acquisition
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.040]   due diligence and integration.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.760]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 57 cents in the third quarter
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.880]   of fiscal 2019, which excluded one cent of costs related to Monroe Forward Initiatives,
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.800]   one cent of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs, and six cents
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.320]   benefit from the one-time income tax adjustment.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.600]   For more information on this non-gap measure, please see the reconciliation of adjusted
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.520]   diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.080]   Lastly, we opened one Greenfield location during the third quarter.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.720]   As a reminder, Greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.640]   of one-to-four store operations.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.400]   Greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately $1 million each in annual
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   sales.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:39.760]   As of December 28, 2019, the company had 1,289 company-operated stores and 99 franchise
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:47.960]   locations, as compared with 1,186 company-operated stores and 99 franchise locations as of December
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.520]   29, 2018.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:57.240]   During the third quarter, we added 27 company-operated stores and closed none.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.400]   Turning to Slide 9, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.000]   as we execute our growth strategy.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.280]   Our capital expenditures were $42.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, of
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:17.480]   which approximately $18 million was related to investments in our Monroe Forward Initiative.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.820]   We are pleased with the progress of our Monroe Forward Strategy and we continue to expect
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:28.720]   an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.920]   to support investments in story image and technology.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:38.720]   Additionally, accretive acquisitions support our growth strategy.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:45.320]   During the first nine months of the year, we spent approximately $104 million on acquisitions,
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.880]   including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our Greenfield expansion strategy.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.000]   As Brett mentioned, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.400]   represent an expected $120 million in annualized sales.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.720]   I'd like to provide some additional clarity here.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   The $120 million in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.320]   have been fully integrated, which as we've stated in the past, is usually in year three
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.280]   post-acquisition.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.520]   During years one and two following the acquisition, we typically see a step down in sales given
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.300]   the process of onboarding new stores to our model.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.420]   Moving on, we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:33.640]   our dividend program and paid approximately $22 million in dividends in the first nine
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   months of fiscal 2020.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.560]   Finally, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.160]   to support our strategic growth initiatives.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.920]   We entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.160]   covenants.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:54.480]   We generated approximately $125 million of cash flow from operating activities during
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.280]   the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and debt under our revolving credit facility increased
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.120]   by approximately $59 million.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.400]   Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide 10.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.600]   We have updated our fiscal 2020 comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.680]   1% to flat to reflect the impact of our year-to-day performance.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   Based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:31.400]   closed acquisition, we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1,275 million
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:40.960]   to $1,290 million, an increase of 6.2% to 7.5% as compared to fiscal 2019 sales.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:49.480]   This compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1,295 million to $1,315 million.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.160]   Our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.720]   2020.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.560]   Given the impact of our year-to-day performance, we expect fiscal 2020 earnings for diluted
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:12.520]   share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 representing a decline of 5.1% to 0.8% year-over-year
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.120]   compared to $2.37 in fiscal 2019.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:23.440]   This compares to the previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.55.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.560]   On an adjusted basis, which is a non-GAP measure, the company expects diluted earnings per share
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:38.600]   to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 representing a decline of 1.7% to growth of 2.5%, which
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.520]   excludes from diluted earnings per share, Monroe Forward initiative costs, and acquisition
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.200]   due diligence and integration costs.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:53.240]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.39 in fiscal 2019, which excluded
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.120]   Monroe Forward initiative costs, non-recurring corporate and field management realignment
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:03.680]   costs, acquisition due diligence and integration costs, and the benefit from the one-time income
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.160]   tax adjustment.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.280]   Acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be diluted to earnings
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.880]   per diluted share during the year.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.840]   At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect an operating margin of approximately
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:24.720]   10.2% interest expense to be approximately $29 million, depreciation and amortization
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:31.480]   to be approximately $65 million, and EBITDA to be approximately $196 million.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.040]   We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million this year.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:42.200]   This guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and is based on 34 million
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.040]   diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.480]   As always, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or Greenfield store openings.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.520]   I'll now turn the call over to Brott to provide some closing remarks before we move to Q&A.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.840]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.200]   We are making solid strides in the execution of our Monroe Forward strategy, in particular
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.320]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.440]   The strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore our
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.840]   confidence in this initiative.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.000]   The store rebrand and reimage program is further supported by our technological investment
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.920]   requirements, which we believe will help drive long term margin expansion.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.680]   In summary, we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   making the appropriate course corrections when necessary, and executing well against
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.520]   the areas within our control.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.440]   We are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   ahead.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.280]   With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   Thank you.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.240]   At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.600]   If you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.520]   A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.440]   You may press star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.340]   For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.520]   before pressing the star keys.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.320]   Once again, that is star 1 to register questions at this time.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.360]   Our first question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.560]   Please go ahead.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.560]   Good morning.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:22.360]   I apologize for focusing on the weather here, but I want to dive deeper into sales trends
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.360]   in the quarter.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:33.480]   You made some comments suggesting that to the degree to which weather impacted the business.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   What that negative point 9 comp would have been had the weather cooperated and some of
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.600]   the metrics you are seeing that really suggest the underlying business is trending better
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.440]   than what we saw in the weather affected fiscal Q3?
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:57.400]   I will take the first part and I will let Brian take the second part of the question,
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   Brian.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.920]   When we look at the performance in the quarter, as we talked about our northern markets certainly
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.280]   underperform the southern markets and give you a little more granularity on that, certainly
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:15.120]   our stores up in the northeast and the Midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   to weather conditions like you have in the northeast certainly underperform.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.620]   I think it is difficult to say what we would have done.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:29.080]   Certainly I think we were expecting positive comps in the quarter.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:35.960]   Our internal expectations would have been closer to plus one to plus one and a half assuming
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.160]   normalized weather conditions that we have seen in the past.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.960]   We felt really good coming out of October/November given the strength of last year's performance
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.880]   that we were topping against and didn't get the cooperation from the weather in December
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.080]   that we were certainly expecting.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:59.760]   As I made the comments in my prior remarks, we certainly don't like talking about the
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:05.840]   weather, Brian, but we can't ignore the fact that when 50% of our business is tires and
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.800]   we have a high concentration of stores in the northeast and the Midwest, we are going
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.760]   to have outsized exposure to our account performance.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:20.720]   Brian, would you mind restating the second part of your question?
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   I think you covered, Brian, maybe I'll just follow up question if I could.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:33.360]   The adjusted guidance, you mentioned so in January you did a negative four.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.280]   If I'm doing the math, it looks as though the adjusted guidance would suggest some type
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.200]   of pickup then in business in February/March.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.120]   I guess the first question is that assumption correct?
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.960]   The following question is, I know we've seen this before with your business, but at what
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:55.720]   point does – because clearly we have potentially a long time in the winter, the weather could
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   still come.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.160]   But is there a point at which in the quarter where the weather just comes too late?
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:09.920]   Yeah, so Brian, your assumption is correct regarding the implied comps.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:16.800]   So if you think about Q4 at the midpoint of, let's say, down point five, for the full
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:23.160]   year, down point five, that implies Q4 of down two, which would be about February and
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.080]   March being down one in order to get to that down two.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.280]   So that's the dynamic at the midpoint, so there is an expectation of a pickup in February
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.780]   and March.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.640]   Brian, maybe just a comment on the second part.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.560]   As we get deeper into the fourth quarter or fourth quarter, the second half of the quarter
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:48.840]   in particular, I think we become less sensitive to the weather as you transition out of say
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.360]   pure winter conditions into spring.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:58.560]   Certainly, I think the later in the quarter you get snowfall certainly doesn't have the
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:04.040]   same impact on tire demand like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.560]   October or November.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.520]   Consumers are pretty frifty with their money, and I believe you get snowfall late in the
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.520]   season.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:18.360]   They have a tendency to forego that purchase and push it out until next season in particular.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.880]   The other thing to call out as well is, if you look at our historic performance at the
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:30.360]   company, December and January have always been the most volatile months that we had to contend
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:36.480]   with, and I think what we've seen in past performance here, trends coming out of December
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:41.240]   January don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring month.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:48.920]   So given the mild December, January heading into the balance of the quarter, we feel pretty
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.120]   good about the guidance range we provided.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.400]   As Brian said, our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our comp sales guidance, it
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.120]   assumes run rate coming out of January, which we certainly believe we're going to be better
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:05.320]   than that as we roll into FY21.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.360]   I appreciate all the color.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.360]   Thank you.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360]   Thank you.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.240]   Our next question is coming from Jonathan Lamers of BMO Capital Markets.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.360]   Please go ahead.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.360]   Thanks.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:26.000]   Brett, looking at your slide on the store rebranding, the 18% performance of the rebranded
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.720]   stores, I think it's good.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.600]   I'm curious, from your analytic model, how many years should it take a rebranded store
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.600]   to reach projected run rate sales?
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:48.640]   If you look at the top quadrant of that slide, Jonathan, we've shared with investors the fact
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.880]   that our service stores do roughly $600,000 in revenue and our tire stores do $1,000,000
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   too.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.240]   So in the case where we're rebranding a service store, you're working off a base on average
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:05.640]   of $600,000, and if we've seen, I'll call it double digit comp improvement off of that
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:12.240]   base, you can get to implied numbers certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:20.000]   to the full maturity, equally in the average sales performance of our tire branded stores.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.440]   That's one of the things that's encouraging about the strategy for us is not that it's
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:30.840]   just a one-time step up in sales, this creates the opportunity to create multiple years of
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:39.100]   sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning, our brand related tires, starts to mature.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:44.120]   Keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.280]   So if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires, we won't be relevant
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.560]   necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.880]   So to put that on a timeline, if you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.480]   out to average sales performance of a tire branded store.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:09.520]   Okay, so just to circle up on that, for the stores where you're rebranding, there's nothing
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:17.520]   about their market, like you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.360]   to your existing tire brand stores of the 1.2 million, is that correct?
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.560]   Yeah, as a general statement, that's correct.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.920]   I think certainly you're going to have markets that will exceed the average and you'll have
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:35.340]   some markets that will be lower than that, and that's part of the choices that we make
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.640]   using the analytic model.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.480]   But on average, as we look across our, I'll say the opportunity stores, that being the
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.280]   5.55, I think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.960]   of the 1.2 over time as they mature.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:35:02.000]   Thanks, switching gears, Brian, how much of a headwind to that revenue from acquisition
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.280]   were the conversions of the 42 California stores this quarter?
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:13.000]   Yeah, I mean, we had some disruption there.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.920]   I would say we haven't really quantified that from a sales standpoint, but that's a great
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.360]   point, Jonathan, in that we have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the Monroe
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:32.440]   Playbook, and then shortly thereafter, in this case, about six months, get the reimage
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.920]   in-store brand standards in place.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:42.640]   So those, in Q3, the 42 California stores went through that, and they're substantially
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:49.720]   through that as of the end of Q3, but we haven't quantified it, but it certainly had some impact
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.520]   on their sales performance in the quarter.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:59.840]   Okay, and that $1.8 million charge from the Monroe Forward Initiative this quarter, what
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.480]   was that for?
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:09.560]   Yeah, it was all related to the store rebrand and reimage, and it falls into three primary
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.840]   buckets related to that.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.920]   The first is non-capital items that we send to the stores.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:24.120]   So as we think about updated safety chains, updated bay banners, updated point of sale
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:31.120]   marketing materials, all of these things to get the store initially to the standard that
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:37.400]   are not capital in terms of the actual work and construction done on the store, that's
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.800]   the first bucket.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   The second bucket is non-capital work that's actually done.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:51.960]   We get into these stores and we identify non-capital repairs, demolition, as well as some of the
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:58.560]   fixed versus replace items, for example, stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.560]   a new floor.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.480]   Those are things that make sense economically, but you get different treatment from expense
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.720]   versus capital for, so that's the second bucket.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:13.360]   And the third is just right off of existing leaseholds in the stores, anything from counters
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:19.000]   to maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition when we initially
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.960]   branded the stores over to a Monroe brand.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:27.240]   Those are the three primary buckets that the Monroe Forward Initiative costs consist
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   of.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.840]   Okay, thanks for your comments.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.840]   Thank you.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.960]   Excuse me, our next question is coming from Brett Jordan of Jeffries.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.960]   Please go ahead.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.960]   Hey, good morning, guys.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.960]   Morning, Brett.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   Hey, back to slide five.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:49.440]   I guess if we look at the 18% growth in rebranded stores, if we really sort of look at the comparable
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.440]   growth there, you know, X the new product lines you're adding, how's the service comp
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.400]   against the service comp in those stores?
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.600]   Are you seeing, you know, a pickup as you change the brand?
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:05.040]   Yeah, maybe just to clarify though, Brett, I think we're actually not adding any new
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.920]   products to the service menu.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.920]   Right.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.120]   But you're adding tires to the store, right?
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.200]   Yeah, it's just mixed, right?
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:17.360]   So even our service stores today sell tires, it's only 15% of their mix.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:23.600]   So we're certainly seeing growth, more outsized growth in their tire sales, and we've had
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:29.360]   success in maintaining the rate of growth that we've seen on the service side.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   Which has been part of our thesis is, hold on to the service business that we've enjoyed
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:41.120]   that's high margin, and then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on tires and
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.560]   drive the growth through the tire category.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.960]   We're seeing growth on both sides.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   Okay.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.600]   And I guess we look at the reimage, how does that compare to, you know, comparable service
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.080]   stores in the network that hadn't been re-imaged?
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.920]   I guess sort of looking at it again, sort of apples to apples, you know, against the
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.920]   old stores.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.440]   Yeah, I think if you can figure out which stores we're talking about there, the 30 stores
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440]   are Rochester.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:12.560]   And I think the Rochester stores certainly have been performing quite well relative to
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.920]   what our expectations were on re-image.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.520]   We certainly didn't expect to see double digit growth rates out of our re-image store when
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.760]   we set out to do this initiative.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:27.360]   So we were seeing a more positive growth out of the stores up until the last quarter, given
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.760]   the exposure that we've had to the weather in the north.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:35.400]   But compared to other stores, we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a customer
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:41.040]   service point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers, facing
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.360]   similar, I would say, market backdrop from a weather point of view.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   Okay.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.880]   Could you give us, I guess, sort of the spread between the Southern Store Cop and the Northern
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.120]   Store Cop, you know, how big of a delta was it?
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.320]   I mean, it was a couple hundred basis points of performance.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Okay.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.760]   And I guess for housekeeping, could you give us the monthly?
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:16.360]   Yeah, so we were, one second here, Brett, we were down 1.2 in October, down 1.7 in November
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.480]   and up 0.4 in December.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   Okay.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.440]   And then one, just this is starting to add the question, on the supply chain side, I
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.240]   mean, just to throw the virus into it since that's popular these days, you guys do a lot
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.520]   of direct sourcing, you know, the white box product out of China, do you see any impact
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.960]   on supply chain from what's going on?
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.240]   We haven't seen any to this point, Brett.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:46.320]   We're obviously working through contingency plans, which we have had to develop actually
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:53.040]   related to the tariff issues, so we feel pretty confident that through the network of, you
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.600]   know, multiple supply points, that we'll be able to overcome any particular issues coming
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.600]   from the virus.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.120]   That's right, I had to get my first virus question in there.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.600]   Yeah, I'm sorry, Brett.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   Go ahead.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   I said no, it's joking.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.880]   I said I had to get my first virus question in there.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.880]   I guess.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   All right.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   Thanks a lot guys.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.880]   Keep on.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.880]   Okay.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.880]   Thanks, Brett.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:20.080]   Thank you, our next question is coming from Rick Nelson of Stevens, please go ahead.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   Thanks.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.080]   Good morning.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.080]   Good morning.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:33.920]   Follow up on the weather last year, I think December, January, you also pointed to mild
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.920]   winter weather.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:41.760]   Do you think this year was incrementally worse than the prior year?
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:48.120]   I think if you look at, you know, analyst reports that we've seen talking about, I guess,
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:53.920]   the impact that the mild winter has had on not only our category, but any other retail,
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:42:00.760]   like the data would indicate that this has been more mild, certainly versus last year.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:06.080]   I think we look at precipitation, which is very important for us as a form of snow with
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:12.640]   our tire business, certainly it's been a much more mild winter this year, relative to last
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.640]   year.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   Thanks.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:23.500]   And Brett, any updates on your partnership with Amazon, what you're seeing there on the
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:35.800]   install side and how you think your tire prices compared to theirs and the tire category overall
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:42.680]   are curious about what happened with units in the period and market share?
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.680]   Yes.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:54.840]   So, let's start with units, where units were down to average selling price was up one for
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.840]   the quarter.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:00.560]   How that compares, we don't have a lot of syndicated data, of course, we can look to
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.960]   and give you definitive on that, we lean on, I guess, our channel checks and information
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.640]   from our tire manufacturers that have good visibility across multiple brands and feels
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:18.200]   like similar to other companies that have exposure to the North, particularly Northeast,
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:24.700]   to the degree that we do feel like we are probably in line with what we picked up through suppliers
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.200]   and others.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:32.200]   As it relates to Amazon, I think we're still pleased with our relationship with them as
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.600]   well as other online tire retailers.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:43.280]   We will eventually expand the relationship in FY21 to include all stores.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:50.080]   We talked about last quarter, our priority has been what I mentioned on today's call,
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.800]   completing the tire category management pricing tool, as well as the labor scheduling tool
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:00.640]   that are just for our organization on a higher priority at this stage than expanding, but
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.200]   we are committed to expanding that relationship going forward.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.800]   Related to tire pricing, as you know Rick, I mean the tire category is very complicated.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:15.120]   You have over 30,000 SKUs that you need to manage effectively across multiple markets
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.840]   and one of the reasons why we've invested in the tire category management tool is to
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.960]   do a couple of things.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:27.800]   One is to give us much better visibility into demand dynamics defined by elasticity, down
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:34.120]   to a SKU level, and by having that visibility, it's going to create a much more granular
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.360]   approach that we're going to use for pricing.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:43.440]   It will allow us to price at the SKU level in our industry with the intent being strike
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.560]   that right balance between driving the right price to drive unit volume while preserving
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:55.040]   and expanding our tire margins through a right mix at right price.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.200]   I'm encouraged we're in pilot form of that now.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.600]   We will be operational by Q1 of next year, fully operational.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.800]   The rollout of that's pretty small in scale because we control our pricing centrally, so
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.160]   a small team of people will be trained up on using that system.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.080]   So between now and Q1, we'll be testing in parallel to make certain we're confident
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.760]   with the results that we're seeing from the system.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.760]   That makes sense.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   Thanks for the call.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.760]   Good luck.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   Thanks, Greg.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   Thank you.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:32.880]   Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.040]   one on your telephone keypad.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.440]   Our next question is coming from Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   Please go ahead.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   Hi, good morning.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440]   Thank you for the question.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.440]   Morning.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   I wanted to go back.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:50.640]   I know in the prior quarters, when you started rolling out some of these store refreshes,
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.920]   you called out a hit or headwind to comps during that quarter, really just from distraction.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:00.640]   You know, it makes sense as you're in there kind of reworking and revamping the stores.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.720]   I believe you said it was about a 70 basis to find hit last quarter.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.880]   Did you quantify that this quarter, or is there a way for you to kind of break that
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.120]   out or just whether overshadow that?
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:18.520]   Yeah, I think we said last quarter, Stephanie, that we walked everyone kind of through the
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:25.640]   seven step process and talked about how we were retooling it to take a lot of that work
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.080]   or almost all that work off of the store team.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.800]   So we were able to effectively do that in Q3.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.000]   We didn't expect that we were going to have to talk about a headwind, and we really don't
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.640]   have to in terms of from disruption related to the store reimage.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:46.680]   I think the California stores on the West Coast maybe saw a little bit more in disruption
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:52.720]   just because we did put a little bit more on them based on their lack of proximity to
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.800]   our core resources that are doing the reimage.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:01.120]   But for the 74 comp stores, those were largely, I would say, undisrupted.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.520]   Great, and then just as a follow-up, when we look at the tire category in general, what
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:11.640]   are you seeing from this over in an inflationary environment, I know it was inflationary earlier
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:17.200]   this year, kind of reviewing how you saw during the quarter and your expectations going forward
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   as well.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   Yes, Stephanie.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:27.240]   When you look at, go back to Q2, one of the things we commented on was just we saw some
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:32.960]   inflationary pricing on, let's say the top end of the product category with more premium
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:40.640]   brands, and the first part of the second quarter, we didn't see a lot of movement on the low
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.360]   end brands, if you will, opening price point brands.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.800]   We saw that change exiting Q2 and into Q3, and I think as you saw and we made the comments
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:56.520]   in our prepared remarks, we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across all
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.760]   price points.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:05.120]   And to that point in Q3, I think our expectation for Q4 is pretty stable environment around
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.120]   pricing.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:11.880]   We don't expect meaningful material changes in the next quarter.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:19.600]   I think we're very focused now on now optimizing our internal pricing relative to the market,
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.320]   leveraging the category management pricing to what we talked about.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.320]   Great.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:30.400]   And then just lastly for me, kind of a more high level as we think through the strategy
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:36.360]   to expand just your tire services at some of those, the mixed changes at your service
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   stores.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:42.800]   Does that just by nature put you a little bit more susceptible to changes in weather on
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   an annual basis?
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:49.200]   To your point, you said on this call that it is the tire category that if it's a more
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:54.400]   mild weather where you don't really see the volume during that period.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.840]   So, does this mean that, you know, in these conversations going forward, weather could
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:02.680]   have a larger impact or similar to what we saw this year that may be in prior years?
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.240]   So maybe your thoughts on that at this high level would be great.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   Thanks so much.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   Thanks, Stephanie.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:14.520]   I think, you know, strategically, I would start with this, they are strategy of mirrors.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:19.880]   We like the business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that's focused
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.600]   on tires and full service.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:26.880]   I think you're not going to see us migrate to a tire only category as a broad sweeping
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.560]   strategy for all the reasons you just mentioned.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.200]   We like diversification in the services.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:37.240]   We like being very relevant on frequently purchased items like scheduled maintenance
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.040]   for cars and certainly brakes and other undercar services.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:47.560]   I think as we increase our total business, certainly we're going to pick up a little
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:53.960]   more exposure to tires as we convert more stores in the north, I think, to that.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:59.040]   However, I think our broader company strategy is diversifier store footprint.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:03.920]   More into the south and out west and certainly in those regions of the country, you don't
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.680]   see, I think, a level of volatility that comes with the tire business like you would find
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:15.640]   in the northeast and midwestern markets.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:21.800]   Great, that's everything for me.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   I appreciate it.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.800]   Okay.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   Thanks, Debbie.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   Thank you.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.720]   Our next question is coming from Scott Stumber of Steel King.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.720]   Please go ahead.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.720]   Good morning.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.920]   Thanks for taking my questions.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   Morning, Scott.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:41.920]   Following up on that last question about high level, about weather, and I know the goal
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.240]   here was with all this heavy lifting that you're doing right now on all these new processes
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:52.320]   to get to the point where I guess we're not talking about weather having worked, whether
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.720]   it does not really deliver all the quarter from a common perspective.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.520]   Could you talk about, I mean, just broadly speaking about how long do you think that
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.040]   will take for us to get to that point where weather could be a headwind, but it's not
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:09.640]   going to be a determinant whether you're positive or negative from a common standpoint?
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:17.600]   Yeah, I think given our exposure to the northeast, as long as our store concentration is heavy
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:23.480]   in the Midwest and northeast inherent in that, as we pick up exposure, I think, to weather.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:27.200]   Obviously, we don't like to talk about sky, as you said.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.640]   Our strategy is to diversify the footprint, keep continuing to grow down south, and that's
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.920]   reflected by our acquisitions.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:39.480]   We continue to build out Florida and have expanded now into Louisiana and Tennessee.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:45.680]   And certainly, out west is reflected of that desire to create more or less volatility in
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.640]   our business due to the store footprint.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:57.320]   Now in our core store markets, we don't accept internally the volatility in our business,
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:03.840]   and we're invested in technology, as we talked about, to help us better execute in stores
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:09.880]   through better trained people, executing better on the phones with our phone upgrade that
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.520]   we're currently doing.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.080]   All of the initiatives under Monroe Forward are designed to drive performance in our stores
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.080]   regardless of weather.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:22.360]   So I think we'll help neutralize some of the impact that we see from the volatility that
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:26.320]   comes with snow and colder temperatures.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.520]   Got it.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.520]   And just a last question.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.440]   I know that there are certain things like tires that we'll see an immediate impact from
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:42.240]   weather, but more on the side of mechanical parts, typically, you could see an impact
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:49.640]   from warmer weather or colder weather, a few quarters down the road.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.200]   Is there a chance that we could see an extended negative impact on the mechanical parts side
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   in the next couple of quarters?
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.200]   And that's all I have.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.200]   Thanks.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.200]   Thanks, Scott.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:05.360]   I think, as we commented in the quarter, our brakes were down 3 percent in the quarter.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.160]   Certainly we're up against a strong comp from last year, but also, I would say we do sell
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:14.800]   a fair share of brake services through tires, because if you take the consumers' tires off
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:20.000]   their vehicle, it gives you the chance to inspect their wheels, their brakes, and we do see
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.600]   some nice demand for conversion from tires into brakes as a result of that.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:32.900]   As it relates to the downstream effect, I think certainly more harsh winners have a tendency
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.320]   to tear up things on the vehicles.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:41.480]   However, I will say one benefit of having a more mild winner is usually that it leads
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.200]   to spring coming sooner.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:48.080]   It opens up a window, I think, for an extended spring selling season.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:55.240]   So we feel like we're well positioned, I think, coming out of the winner, given our strengths
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:54:00.000]   in how we perform historically in the service categories, and given the emphasis that we
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:06.240]   place on good, better, best packages in store, I think we feel confident that we'll be well
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.880]   positioned going into the spring selling season.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.880]   Got it.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:11.880]   That's all I have.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.880]   Thanks.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.880]   Thanks, Scott.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.880]   Thanks, Scott.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.880]   Thank you.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:21.360]   At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:25.120]   Thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest and support in Monroe.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:29.040]   We believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy and drive long-term value for
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.040]   our shareholders.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:32.920]   We look forward updating you on our progress next quarter.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.160]   Have a great day.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.240]   This concludes today's event.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.400]   You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   Good morning and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 General Electric Company Earnings Conference
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.640]   Call.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.160]   My name is Brandon and I'll be your operator for today.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.360]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.100]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session during which you can dial star one
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.760]   if you have a question.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.320]   Please note this conference is being recorded and I will now turn it over to Steve Winiker,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.680]   Vice President of Investor Communications, you may begin sir.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.680]   Thanks Brandon.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.600]   Good morning and welcome to GE's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.560]   I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO Larry Kulp and CFO, Carolina Dadekapa.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.880]   Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880]   on our website.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.120]   Note that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and are based on our best
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.000]   view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.840]   As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840]   world changes.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.720]   With that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.240]   Steve, thanks.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240]   Good morning everyone.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.200]   We hope you and your families are healthy and safe, our thoughts are with all of those
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.680]   affected by this global pandemic.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.560]   We recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.360]   On behalf of GE, I want to express our gratitude to those on the frontlines in the medical community,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.400]   many of whom were privileged to call our customers, working tirelessly to protect all of us.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.400]   Thank you.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.000]   When we last spoke during our Outlook call in March, we were encouraged by the continued
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.760]   strength in aviation and healthcare and the progress made in power and renewables.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.560]   In the eight-week sense, the world has fundamentally changed.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.480]   As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly, hitting hard and hitting fast.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.600]   While this is an earnings call, our goal today is to provide you with the most current and
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.160]   relevant information we have, and as always, to be as open and transparent as we possibly
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.160]   can.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.800]   So forgive us if we run a little long today.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.840]   The COVID-19 dynamics at GE, like the economy at large, are fluid and still evolving, but
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.760]   clearly challenging in the near term.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.240]   With that, I'll start with our response to COVID-19.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.120]   Carolina, who is joining our earnings call for the first time, will cover the financials,
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.480]   then I'll wrap with a more in-depth view of our current operations.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.840]   Moving to slide two, during this unprecedented time, we're focused on three areas.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.360]   First, the health and safety of our employees and our communities.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.800]   We established a COVID-19 task force that is working to ensure we're doing everything
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.120]   in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with various government directives
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.400]   and medical advisories in real time.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.680]   To that end, we've encouraged those employees who are not directly performing customer-facing
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.780]   essential jobs to work from home wherever possible.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.040]   But given the mission-critical work we do at GE, not everyone can stay home.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.720]   I'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.320]   unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers, supporting essential services
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.160]   like hospitals, power generation, airlines, and national defense.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.640]   We're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.360]   This includes temperature screenings, face coverings, and gloves as necessary, and physical
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.120]   distancing, all keeping with national, state, and local guidelines.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.720]   I'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.680]   We recently established an employee relief fund, and more than 75 senior leaders across
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.920]   GE have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.320]   Our second priority is continuing to serve our customers.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.040]   In healthcare, we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.660]   and treat COVID-19 patients, including respiratory CT monitoring solutions, X-ray anesthesia,
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.080]   and point of care ultrasound product lines.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.960]   Already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.320]   end of June.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.160]   Healthcare's digital and AI solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.920]   at once and automate wrote tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.820]   on life-saving work.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.120]   Across all of our businesses, we're in constant communication with employees, customers, suppliers,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.560]   and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.600]   Our third priority is preserving our strength.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.520]   First and foremost, sound liquidity is crucial, and solidifying our balance sheet remains
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.440]   a key focus.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.200]   With the recent closing of the biopharma transaction, we've received $20 billion of net proceeds.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.160]   This provides GE with optionality to protect our company and remain flexible, and importantly,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.920]   we've retained a $17 billion leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem striving
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.160]   for precision health.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.440]   Preserving our strength at a time like this also requires a different operating model.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.160]   Here I draw on my experience as a CEO managing through 9/11 and the global financial crisis.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.840]   There are three steps in this model.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.960]   Embrace reality, redefine winning, and execute the plan.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.240]   Easy to say, hard to do.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.080]   Starting with embrace reality, this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.720]   and remains uncertain.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.680]   For us, it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation, and we may
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.600]   be for a while.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.120]   We wish it were otherwise, but that's not our reality.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.080]   Next, redefine winning.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.800]   We came into 2020 with a plan that defined winning as profitable growth, margin expansion,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.280]   and cash generation.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.320]   Now, we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.280]   Let me share some ways we're doing this.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.360]   While safety has always been a top priority for GE, COVID-19 has reshaped our safety agenda.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.800]   In terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and decriminal margins
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.400]   in the second half, our key focus areas.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.880]   And in healthcare, we clearly didn't come into the year expecting to increase our ventilator
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.080]   production fourfold, but we will.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.120]   And finally, execute the plan.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.880]   We're moving with speed, discipline, and intensity to improve our cost structure, targeting more
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.400]   than $2 billion of cost actions and more than $3 billion of cash actions.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.040]   And this is where LEAN is particularly relevant, from daily management to traditional Kanban
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.320]   systems which help reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools we're rolling out
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.440]   across GE.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.640]   Let me share a recent example from gas power.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.680]   In our Greenville facility, the team used LEAN to cut the distance that a single part
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.960]   travels during production from three miles, yes, three miles, to a mere 165 feet, flashing
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.880]   the time it took to make that part by 42%.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.920]   These are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.560]   environment.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.160]   So that's our approach here.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.480]   We're facing the pandemic head on while continuing to execute our long-term strategy for GE.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.360]   Moving to slide three, you'll find a snapshot of our first quarter results.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.640]   And Carolina will take you through this in detail, but first a few top-line thoughts.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.840]   As I noted, we entered the year with momentum.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.840]   However, as COVID-19 continued to spread globally, and I'm not going to sugarcoat this, we got
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.480]   hit hard in some of our highest margin parts of our best-performing businesses.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.640]   This is especially true at aviation services, where COVID-19 caused a rapid decline in commercial
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.240]   aviation demand, and even essential travel became difficult in the second half of March.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.200]   A similar situation also transpired at power services, where travel restrictions caused
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.120]   by COVID-19 impacted our field personnel.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.440]   And across all of our businesses, we started to see some project fulfillment and execution
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   issues.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.480]   At the same time, healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.600]   in the fight against COVID-19.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:38.440]   Taking a step back, about 80% of our roughly $400 billion backlog is in services, which
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.640]   have a long time horizon.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.680]   And while services have been hurt in the near term, those capabilities remain one of our
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.120]   greatest strengths.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.240]   They keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships, especially through
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.280]   periods of volatility.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.160]   So in the spirit of embracing reality, let me frame for you what we're seeing right now
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.960]   at a high level, and then I'll do a deeper dive after Carolina reviews the first quarter.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.520]   In aviation and at GCask, airlines are conserving cash, not flying the planes they have, limiting
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.520]   maintenance spare, spend where they can, and all the while deferring orders in many places.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.840]   No one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume, but the reality
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.600]   is likely it's not soon.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.080]   So we're redefining winning.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:31.000]   The margin expansion in 2020 to improving our decriminal margins this year requires we
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.600]   aggressively adjust our cost structure.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.960]   That's what winning looks like for aviation, and they're moving forward with a comprehensive
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   plan.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:44.200]   To be clear, we'll get back to targeting those 20% operating margins post pandemic.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.960]   In healthcare, we've been on the front lines, combating COVID-19 since the early days in
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.840]   Wuhan.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.720]   This is fundamental to our mission.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.760]   While we've seen demand surge for certain products, other products, including those in
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.640]   our high margin pharmaceutical diagnostics business, have been negatively impacted as
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.960]   multiple procedures are deferred.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.280]   Healthcare is likely to rebound faster than aviation, but we're still fast tracking additional
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:18.720]   cost out actions, targeting an incremental $700 million since Karen and the team spoke
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.240]   with you in December.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.040]   In power and renewable energy, the impact of COVID-19 has been more limited to date.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.840]   Specifically at power, we're experiencing outage delays and restrictions in field service
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.520]   travel and we're monitoring new unit orders and services.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.240]   To offset this, we're further right sizing the cost structure and in power, we already
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   reduced headcount by 700 in the first quarter.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.920]   Now clearly across GE, there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.600]   point, including the full duration magnitude and pace of recovery across our end markets
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.400]   operations and supply chains.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.840]   We're also monitoring how the resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.760]   and our runoff insurance business.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.720]   Let me tell you what we do know.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.200]   The second quarter will be the first full quarter with pressure from COVID-19.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.920]   We expect that our financial results will decline sequentially before they improve later
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.760]   this year.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.040]   The bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead, but this too shall pass.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.480]   I'm confident the underlying reset we took over the last 18 months to focus GE's portfolio
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   and instill a greater focus on customers and lead give us a running start for what we face
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   today.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.880]   Moreover, I've seen our response to COVID-19 signs of how we're moving faster to change
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.600]   GE for the good, more to re-work to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.760]   in aviation, travel restrictions spurring on the use of remote digital technology to
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.480]   complete fieldwork and renewables, and more capital discipline across the board, with new
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:08.600]   leaders assimilating faster and with real impact, healthcare comes to mind.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.960]   So all of this in combination with the planned actions we'll discuss later are accelerating
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.680]   our transformation of GE.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.840]   With that, I'll turn it over to Carolina, but before I do, let me say how pleased I
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.520]   am to have her on board.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:26.120]   In two short months, it's clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.480]   operational bias reaction and executing with speed.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.600]   Thank you, Larry.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.120]   I'm proud to join my first earnings call at CFO of GE and help lead this company forward.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:47.480]   As you noted, we're operating in unprecedented times and we're focused on, first, keeping
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.720]   our financial position strong and safe with a keen eye on leverage and liquidity, as well
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.760]   as cash flow and capital discipline.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.840]   While GE's actions over the last couple of years have put us on stronger footing ahead
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.480]   of this situation, we will do more.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.760]   Second, working with our businesses to take the right action, not only to help mitigate
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.200]   the impact of COVID-19, but to serve customers better, operate smarter and more efficiently
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.240]   and integrate lean more holistically.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.600]   While Larry and I are focused on the near term, we're also managing for the long term.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.520]   We're working together to reduce complexity at GE and build a lean culture that delivers
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.520]   sustainable earnings and cash flow generation.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:35.440]   Today, my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.060]   help you see what I see across the businesses.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.400]   With that, let's turn to slide four.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.520]   This was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated, taking
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.280]   it from the top.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.640]   First quarter orders were down 3% organically or down 4% ex-biopharma.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.240]   Growth in power and healthcare was offset by double-digit declines in aviation and renewables.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.280]   Both equipment and service orders were down low single digits.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.720]   I'll cover this by business shortly.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.320]   Industrial revenue was down 5% organically or down 6% ex-biopharma, with equipment revenue
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.720]   flat and services down 9%.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.280]   Both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID-19.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.280]   Adjusted industrial profit margins were down 450 basis points organically.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.400]   Most of the dilution came from aviation and renewables, with the aviation impact mostly
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.520]   driven by COVID-19.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:40.800]   Now let's discuss the EPS Watt, starting at continuing EPS of 72 cents.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.560]   There was a 75 cents gain primarily related to the 11.5 billion off-attacks gain from
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.740]   the biopharma sale, which also included one cent of tax benefit in geotapidol.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.960]   This was partially offset by a 4.6 billion off-attacks loss on our remaining Baker-Huge
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.280]   stake, which we measure at fair value edge quarter.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.720]   On restructuring and other items, we incurred two cents of charges.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.640]   This is principally related to the reduction of aviation's U.S. workforce.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:17.300]   Lastly, non-operating pension and other benefit plans were a six-cent head within the quarter.
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.720]   Excluding these items, adjusted EPS was five cents.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.080]   As described earlier, our earnings performance was materially impacted by COVID-19 and other
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.080]   market dynamics.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.520]   This was primarily in aviation and geocapital with negative marks and impairments in both
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.820]   G-CAS and insurance, as well as higher credit costs.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:44.000]   We estimate the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from COVID-19, roughly 700 million.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.480]   Drivers included lower aftermarket sales, project delays, and supply chain constraints.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:55.160]   This impact is higher than anticipated at the March Outlook Hall, reflecting the rapid
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.400]   global progression of the pandemic, while our prior forecast largely reflected the slowdown
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.560]   in China.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.800]   Our focus on addressing this pandemic is global.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.360]   We're targeting more than two billion of costs out this year.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.800]   While this may not affect the full impact, we're rapidly addressing both cost and cash
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.000]   and making our businesses more agile and customer-focused over time.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.400]   I can tell you from my experience that as these programs build momentum and the company
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.640]   leaders begin to see how powerful results can be, they tend to extend beyond their stated
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640]   goals.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.240]   With just what I have seen so far, I'm encouraged that we can have some of that fail experience
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   achieved.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.920]   Moving to cash, as many of you know, the first quarter is typically low for our free cash
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.920]   flow.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:48.480]   This year, we're impacted by our usual seasonality, but also COVID-19, especially in aviation.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   Industrial free cash flow was a use of 2.2 billion.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.520]   That's one billion worse than prior year, but notably excluding aviation, each industrial
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:04.800]   business improved free cash flow versus last year, turning to the key drivers in the quarter.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.400]   Starting with net earnings, if you exclude the biopharm again and the market on our baking
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:15.320]   hubs investment, income depreciation and amortization total 700 million.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.960]   That's down 900 million versus prior year.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   Working capital, negative 2.6 billion, with a significant use of cash, down 1.1 billion.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.560]   Let me take it through the main factors.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:33.600]   First, we had the net inflow in accounts receivable, driven by seasonally lower volume in gas power
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   and renewables.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:40.520]   Second, we had an outflow in accounts cable, driven by a lower volume in aviation and higher
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.440]   disbursements related to prior year material buys in renewables.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:50.760]   Third, we increased inventory to support an expected second and third quarter volume ramp
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.680]   in onshore wind and shop output declined in aviation.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.400]   Fourth, progress collections.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:02.280]   They were a use of cash as new orders and milestone payments were more than effected by burn down
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.360]   of prior progress payments in power and renewables.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.920]   Lastly, we also spent about 600 million in gross capital.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.720]   We don't track now to reduce 25% of our capital spent this year.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:21.560]   For cash flow in total, we estimate the first quarter impact from COVID-19 of around 1 billion,
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.040]   the majority of which was felt in aviation.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.080]   As we look forward, we expect continued free cash flow pressure.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.640]   We're targeting more than 3 billion in cash action.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.160]   However, over time we know that each business can be a better cash generator as we improve
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.520]   execution.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.800]   Moving to slide 6, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.360]   Largest milestone in the quarter was closing by a pharma.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:55.240]   With 20 billion of percent, we ended the quarter with 33.8 billion of industry cash up approximately
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.360]   16 billion sequentially.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:04.600]   TA capital ended with 13.5 billion of cash, down approximately 5.3 billion sequentially,
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.720]   driven by contractual maturity.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.640]   We continue to hold a liquidity balance covering 12 months of G-debt maturity.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:18.760]   We've recently taken actions to enhance and expand our liquidity and pay down debt.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:24.400]   On April 17, GE entered into a three-year, 15 billion syndicated revolving credit facility.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:32.040]   This was a planned refinancing of GE's prior 20 billion syndicated revolver credit facility,
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.440]   including bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of 20 billion in total credit
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.440]   lines.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.080]   Following the sale of biopharma, we also improved our liquidity profile in April.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:50.400]   We reduced our near-term debt maturity by issuing 6 billion in GE debt in April and subsequently
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.080]   tendering for 4.2 billion of debt.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.800]   We plan to use the remaining 1.8 billion of proceeds to further debt reduction, and the
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.440]   combination of transactions will therefore be leveraged neutral.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:10.880]   The industry has no debt maturity in 2021, 1.9 billion of maturity in 2022, and 900 million
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   in 2023.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:17.280]   At GE Industrial, we reduced debts by approximately 7 billion.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:23.160]   We reduced commercial paper used by 1.1 billion in the quarter, and we paid 6 billion of the
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:28.280]   intercompany loan from GE to GE capital in April, using proceeds from biopharma.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:35.000]   At GE Capital, we reduced debt by 4 billion, so we reduced external debt by 10 billion
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.560]   yesterday, including 4.7 billion of maturity in the quarter, and an additional 5.4 billion
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:48.400]   of 2020 maturity, tendered in April, offset by GE's 6 billion repayment from the intercompany
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   loan.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:56.520]   Our financial policy goals remain, maintaining a high cash balance, achieving less than
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:03.840]   2.5 times net debt to EBDA at GE Industrial, and less than 4 times debt to equity at GE
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:10.640]   Capital, accrediting in the single A range, and reinstating a dividend in line with peers
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   over time.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.640]   We remain committed to achieving our leveraged targets, but we now expect to achieve those
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:23.360]   targets over a longer period than previously or not due to the impact of COVID-19.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.520]   Next on slide 7, we'll discuss industrial segments results.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   Starting with aviation.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.160]   As we've noted, our first quarter results were materially impacted.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.760]   Orders were down 13 percent organically, with both equipment and service orders down.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.720]   Equipment orders were down 27 percent, primarily driven by commercial engines business due
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.520]   to the max grounding and the COVID impact.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.040]   Service orders were down 4 percent, primarily driven by commercial services, partially offset
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.880]   by military, which one new fighter and helicopter service orders from the US DOD.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.160]   Service orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders, which were up
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.400]   60 percent year over year.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:13.560]   Backlog of 273 billion was flat sequentially and up 22 percent versus prior years, primarily
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.720]   driven by long term service agreements.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:22.320]   This included roughly 200 LEAP 1B unit order cancellations in the quarter.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.520]   Revenue was down 11 percent organically.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.600]   Equipment revenue was down 17 percent, we shipped 472 commercial install and spare engine units
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.440]   this quarter, down 37 versus prior years.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:44.200]   Sales of 272 LEAP 1A and 1B units were down 152, and CFM 56 units were down 98 units.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:51.800]   Service revenue was down 8 percent due to commercial services down 11 percent.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:58.480]   This was driven by lower spare parts shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of COVID-19.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.920]   Total military revenue was down 7 percent, with 146 engine units shipments down 9 percent,
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.920]   and this was driven by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound material aid, partly
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.680]   assessed by the advanced programs growth.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.600]   Operating profit was down 39 percent organically, primarily on lower volume and negative mixed
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:26.280]   pressure in commercial services from the impact of COVID-19 and lower spare engine units.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.440]   Segment margin contracted 650 basis points organically, but this was primarily due to
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:37.080]   COVID-19 impacting our commercial businesses in both engines and services.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:44.320]   We continued 737 MAX grounding, the non-repeat of prior year favorable contract adjustments
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.160]   and the first full quarter of revenue from our aerodrivetive business now that we have
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.120]   deconsolidated Baker-Fuse.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:56.200]   To add a bit more color, COVID-19 represents just over half of the year-over-year margin
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   difference.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:03.040]   737 MAX timing, considering install and spare engine volumes and supply chain excess costs
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:08.040]   represent additional 20 percent of the world.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   Moving to health care, which performed well.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.360]   Orders were up 9 percent organically, equipment orders were up 14 percent, and services were
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.360]   up 1.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.160]   Health care orders excluding biopharma were up 6 percent, driven by a surge demand related
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160]   to COVID-19.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.680]   This was partially assessed by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:34.360]   to COVID-19, examples like MR and intervention in health care systems, as well as contrast
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.800]   media and nuclear tracers from a suitable diagnosis.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.240]   Life sciences orders were up 10 percent.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:48.600]   Backlog was 17.4 billion, down 6 percent sequentially and down 3 versus prior year due to the sale
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   of biopharma.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.480]   So excluding biopharma, backlog was up 1 percent sequentially and 4 versus prior year.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.160]   Revenue was up 2 percent organically and 1 percent excluding biopharma.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.720]   Health care systems revenue was up 2 percent with services and 3 percent with equipment
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   flat.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.640]   Life sciences was up 4 percent.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:16.160]   Operating profit was up 10 percent organically, segment margin expanded 140 basis points organically
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.440]   or 30 basis points excluding biopharma.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:24.040]   This was driven by volume and cost productivity, or fed by price and logistics pressures from
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.840]   COVID-19.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.920]   Next, on power, we had mixed results with equipment, top line strengths, or fed by challenges
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.240]   in services.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.120]   Orders were up 14 percent organically.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.920]   Gas power orders were up 8 percent, with equipment orders up 37 percent largely due to one-term
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.920]   key orders.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:49.080]   We booked 2.2 gigawatts of orders for nine gas turbines.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.020]   Gas power service orders were down 3 percent with contractual services down and transaction
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.480]   and upgrades roughly flat.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.480]   Powered portfolio orders were up 27 percent with strong equipment and services orders
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.640]   in spoon and power conversion.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.280]   Backlog closed at 85 billion, flat sequentially and down 1 percent versus prior year.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.400]   Gas backlog was 71 billion of flat sequentially.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.120]   Revenue was down 12 percent organically, largely driven by services.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:25.320]   Gas power revenue was down 12 percent, gas power equipment revenue was up 4 percent organically
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.360]   on higher H-Turbine mix.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:33.520]   We shipped seven gas turbines versus nine gas turbines in the first quarter of '19.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.840]   We helped our customers achieve commercial operations on over 32 units, translating
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:44.000]   almost 4.7 gigawatts of new power added to the grid.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.160]   Gas power services revenue was down 19 percent.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:53.280]   As outage is this and transaction stays pushed out of the quarter due to COVID-19 and we
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.360]   had lower revenue on higher margin upgrades.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.960]   Despite this, services would still have been down in the quarter.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:05.120]   This was driven by supply-based constraints on hot gas part parts and outage costs overall
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.560]   pressuring our CSA margin rate.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.080]   Power portfolio revenue was down 12 percent.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.400]   This was driven by lower volumes across the subsegment.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.800]   In steel, we had lower services, back low convertibility, in nuclear, the decline was
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.720]   driven by outage timing and in power conversion we refined our sales parameter focused on
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.120]   higher margin market segments.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:36.240]   Operating profit was down 239 million and segment margin contracted 570 basis points organically.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.400]   While gas power fixed costs were down 9 percent sequentially and 16 versus prior year, this
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:48.760]   was more than a set by lower service volume and additional costs from COVID-19 disruption.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.040]   Next on renewables, continue revenue growth was more than a set by fulfillment and execution
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.680]   issues impacting profitability.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.520]   Orders were down 11 percent organically.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:06.600]   Equipment were down 11 as we cycle a stronger US PTC and services were down 23 percent.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:12.680]   A positive spot in the quarter was international orders which were up 11 percent.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:18.720]   Backlog of 26.5 billion was down 4 percent sequentially but up 5 percent versus prior
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.760]   year.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.680]   Revenue was up 28 percent organically.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.520]   This was mainly driven by onshore wind up 60 percent.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:34.240]   Onshore equipment revenue was up 81 percent with the new unit turbine delivery of 731 more
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:40.960]   than double prior year and repower kit delivers of 219 up 40 percent.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:46.320]   Onshore services revenue excluding repower kits was up 15 percent.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:52.360]   Onshore order pricing index continues to stabilize at 1 percent in line with recent trends.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.960]   Grid revenue was down 8 percent mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones driven
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.640]   by COVID-19.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.000]   Operating loss was down 115 million.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.840]   This was driven by supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 fulfillment delays and the
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.920]   non-recurrence of non-cash gain from offshore wind contract termination in the prior year.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.440]   This was partially upset by higher onshore wind volume.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:23.120]   Pegment margin contracted 210 basis points mainly driven by the same items mentioned
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:30.680]   above and the range of execution issues we are fixing at grid and hydro.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.840]   Moving to slide 8 starting with GE Capital.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.800]   In the quarter adjusted continue operations generated a net loss of 118 million.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.640]   This excludes the impact of the capital loss tax benefit utilized against biopharm again
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.480]   resulting in 88 million of earnings.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:55.040]   Compared to prior year which excludes the U.S. tax reform benefit continuing net earnings
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.440]   was unfavorable by 154 million.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.760]   This was due to negative marks and impairments at GCAS and insurance lower gains and lower
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.160]   earnings from a smaller asset base.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.680]   This was partially upset by lower excess interest costs and SGNAD.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.760]   We ended the quarter with 101 billion of assets excluding liquidity.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.800]   This was done 1 billion sequentially primarily driven by GCAS due to asset sales depreciation
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.760]   and collections partially upset by new volume.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.840]   Final assets were flat sequentially as the decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:36.680]   by higher market rates was upset by the annual insurance with capital contribution.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:42.160]   Supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continued to migrate to MUFG.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:48.240]   As noted earlier capital ended the quarter with 13.5 billion of liquidity.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:54.560]   Capital also ended with 54.5 billion of debt which was down 4.5 billion sequentially driven
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.400]   by debt maturity.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.760]   This continued operations generated a net loss of 164 million which was unfavorable versus
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.760]   prior year by 200 million.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:11.200]   We still plan to provide the required support to GE Capital in line with insurance tax door
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   funding.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:18.120]   Next, just like our businesses corporate needs to adjust to our new reality and we are continuing
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:24.520]   to take additional structural actions to rationalize costs and reduce the size at corporate.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:31.240]   Coming at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were 374 million 8% higher but that's primarily
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.720]   due to higher intercompany profit elimination which will partially upset by better digital
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.920]   performance from continued cost reduction actions.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:46.080]   Functions and operations were 25% lower primarily driven by GE Digital's improvement.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.240]   You can see from digital performance that the focus cost reduction programs are gaining
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.240]   traction.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.920]   We continue to right size our functional cost across GE and push more accountability into
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.420]   the division.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.720]   Larry and I are conducting cost and cash reviews of each of the businesses with fresh eyes
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.120]   in the current environment so you can expect that there will be more to come.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.120]   Stay tuned.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:15.960]   I have spent most of my career in leadership at lean decentralized companies.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:21.200]   Fundamentally, I believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers business
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.560]   businesses to take the right actions quickly.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:29.880]   This type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with COVID-19
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.640]   but also to be prepared to pivot to growth.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.520]   We're working toward this goal and there will be more to come.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.400]   With that, back to you Larry.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.360]   Carolina, thank you.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.560]   There's no question that COVID-19 is putting real pressure on our businesses.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.840]   Given that so much has changed and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:01.600]   from COVID-19, I'd like to spend some time here discussing second quarter trending based
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.360]   on what we're seeing through the month of April.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.320]   Starting with aviation on slide nine.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.160]   Of all of our industrial segments, this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.660]   severely.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.520]   The rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.920]   airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:29.080]   We'll cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail, but on the
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.960]   other end of the spectrum demand for our military business remains strong.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.480]   To that end, we rebalanced some of our capacity to meet this increased demand.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.120]   To offset some pressure in the commercial business, we're taking several steps that
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:49.120]   while painful preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:55.560]   We've previously announced $500 to $1 billion in costs and cash actions and we've now increased
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:02.880]   this targeting more than $1 billion in cost actions and more than $2 billion in cash actions.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.880]   This will be achieved through different initiatives, some of which have been completed, others
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.040]   in flight as we speak.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.880]   These include a 10% reduction in aviation's total U.S. workforce and furloughs impacting
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:22.600]   50% of its U.S. maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufacturing.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.000]   We'll continue to monitor and potentially extend as required.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:35.520]   We're also focused on reducing the discretionary and cap expand and optimizing working capital.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.800]   I know aviation's decremental margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.640]   and Carolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.100]   While we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the second
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:53.440]   quarter, our expectations are that the cost actions we're undertaking will improve decremental
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.680]   margins in the back half of the year.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.480]   While there are many uncertainties, I expect that we will exit the year with a much lower
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.240]   decremental margin than what you saw in the first quarter.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.800]   So make no mistake, thriving improvement here is our number one focus.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.680]   As we think about the full year, we're tracking travel restrictions, carrier and passenger
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.000]   behavior, disease countermeasures and freight demand, all of which will impact aircraft
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.400]   departures and revenue passenger kilometers.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:27.760]   While we're seeing an unprecedented decline in 2020, we're taking action and David and
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:34.760]   the team are working proactively with our customers to navigate through this crisis.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.920]   So spending a little more time on commercial services, which represented $3.3 billion of
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.680]   revenue in the first quarter, let's go to slide 10.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.420]   As you can see on the left side, departures across the full industry were strong in the
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.200]   first quarter before rapidly declining in mid-March.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.920]   As we look at it this week, focused on the GE and CFM fleet, global departures are down
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.160]   approximately 75%.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.840]   Roughly 60% of the CFM fleet is parked today.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.120]   In line with this, we're also seeing significant headwinds in global shop visits, which were
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.080]   down low double digits in the first quarter as airlines defer short term maintenance and
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.960]   we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better, with some potential to moderate
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.440]   in the latter half of the year, depending on the variables just outlined.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.240]   Based on what we're seeing through the month of April in the second quarter, we're seeing
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:31.600]   shop visits down roughly 60% and CSA billings down roughly 50%.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.920]   Additionally, we expect this significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.160]   to pressure our CSA margins.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.720]   That said, when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time, GE is well
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:51.440]   positioned with the largest and youngest installed base of all engine manufacturers.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:59.520]   Additionally, roughly 62% of our GE CFM fleet has seen one shop visit or the last and this
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.280]   will generate demand upon recovery.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:08.040]   We have more narrow bodies that are 10 years or younger than the narrow body installed
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.920]   base of the rest of the industry, and when we see a pickup and air travel demand, we
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.320]   expect narrow bodies will recover most quickly.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.080]   Overall, it was a challenging quarter and we're expecting additional pressure here
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:26.400]   in the second, but our cost action will alleviate some of the pressure in the second half of
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   2020.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:34.880]   Moving to commercial engines, which represented $1.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.280]   In light of COVID-19, airframers are producing at a lower rate.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:43.120]   Based on what we're seeing through the month of April, in the second quarter, we see installed
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:49.440]   engines down roughly 45% and spare engines down roughly 60% year on year, attributable
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.160]   to the delivery deferrals in addition to the already planned lower production rate on
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.440]   the 737 max.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.680]   In the near term, we're rightsizing production capacity and actively managing the supply
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.840]   base.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.840]   We have very strong relationships with the airframers and an attractive value proposition
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.600]   is evidenced by a multi-year backlog.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.080]   As you'll see on the right, we have strong positions, sole source on two of the biggest
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:19.200]   new engine entrants, and a 65% win rate on the other.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.760]   While we acknowledge there's pressure on near term demand for new aircraft, these stats demonstrate
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:29.040]   the customer see the value of GE technology.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:35.000]   We're taking the right actions to be well positioned for the post-pandemic world.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.880]   Moving to healthcare, which consists of healthcare systems and PDX.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.200]   In the second quarter to date, we're seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.560]   in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 within healthcare systems.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.520]   Now, these product orders, including ventilators, have increased one and a half to two times
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:59.020]   versus pre-pandemic levels, but at the same time, we're seeing reduced demand for other
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:04.560]   diagnostic products as certain procedures are deferred or canceled around the world.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.840]   To be clear, these other diagnostics are still essential and often associated with saving
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:16.440]   lives in areas including oncology and cardiology, but are currently deprioritized.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.520]   PDX is a similar story.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.920]   This is a high margin business made up of contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.840]   with procedures that are being deferred or canceled right now.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:35.160]   Several HCS product lines and most PDX is down as much as 50% versus pre-pandemic levels.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.400]   While these dynamics vary by country, there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.160]   experience different stages of the virus.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:48.120]   Taking China, for example, as hospitals come back online, we're seeing a ramp in previously
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:53.800]   deferred procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:59.320]   Care is accelerating its planned transformation to expand margins post-biopharma by reducing
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:06.440]   headcount, fixed costs, discretionary spend, and marketing spend, prioritizing R&D, deferring
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.920]   CAPX, and optimizing working capital.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.920]   Looking forward, we're most focused on the following indicators for healthcare, hospital
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:20.720]   admission and occupancy rates, an increase in non-COVID-19 procedures, changes in hospital
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:26.960]   CAPX budgets, government spending on healthcare broadly, and development of COVID-19 test treatments
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.760]   and vaccines.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.280]   Based on our experience in China and the market in April, we expect to be down in the second
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.840]   quarter with potential recovery afterwards.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:44.040]   COVID-19 has highlighted the need to build and truly invest and scale a new digitized
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.800]   infrastructure and quickly.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.080]   We're committed to our investments in our digital Edison platform and solutions like
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:56.520]   Neural Virtual Care Solution, which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous ventilated
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.800]   patients simultaneously, helping to expand their capacity while reducing their risk
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:05.200]   of exposure.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.480]   As our digital healthcare journey continues, we're at the center of an ecosystem striving
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.760]   for precision health.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:18.000]   I'm very proud of the work our team is doing to combat COVID-19.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.840]   Moving to power on slide 13, we'll talk to the current trending in the second quarter
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:29.200]   to date in dynamics of gas power and power portfolio.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:33.520]   Starting with gas power equipment, while we're monitoring and managing supply chain disruptions,
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:40.080]   as of today, we still see a path to 45 to 50 gas turbine deliveries this year, but our
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.800]   orders profile and therefore cash down payments worth several hundred million dollars are
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:51.120]   likely weaker due to IPP pressures in the U.S. and Mexico as we expect that deal financing
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.240]   will become harder through the year.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:00.520]   Additionally, with oil price pressure impacting Middle East and SSA investment, including
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:06.360]   demand for new LNG, we are expecting a longer road to normalization.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.240]   Ultimately, we're sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin of creative
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.960]   backlog with disciplined execution.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.320]   In services, approximately 20 percent of planned averages are shifting from the first half
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.280]   of this year due to COVID-19 field labor constraints.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.680]   We're also seeing pressure on upgrades, primarily in the Middle East, where low oil prices are
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.160]   impacting customer budgets.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:36.560]   We are seeing GE gas turbine utilization in the U.S. up mid-single digits due to low gas
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:42.640]   prices in the ship from coal, but utilization globally is down low double digits due to
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.840]   lower electricity demand.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.920]   Within power portfolio, our steam business is most impacted.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.680]   Factory closures pressured our steam operations, including one facility in Wuhan, which was
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.120]   closed for approximately eight weeks in the first quarter.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:02.680]   Today, we're back up to more than 70 percent of capacity.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.360]   The global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in India, driven by government
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.360]   restrictions.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.320]   Overall, we're seeing about 30 percent of outers shift from the first half of this year
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:19.480]   to the second half, with another 10 to 15 percent pushing into next year.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   Our power businesses are taking several measures to offset these pressures.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:30.520]   In the first quarter, we reduced headcount by 700, notified approximately 1,300 contractors,
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:35.760]   implemented a hiring freeze, and in line with the demand profile, we are taking even further
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.480]   actions.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:44.600]   This will serve to reduce fixed cost in 2020 and drive benefits in 2021.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.800]   Looking forward, we're tracking a number of items, including timing of our gas turbine
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:53.440]   new order closure, service outages and volume, wheat utilization is the energy mix, and our
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.800]   fuel prices are impacting each region differently, supplier impacts, and project execution, billing
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.440]   milestones, and customer collections.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:08.840]   We're targeting to have our accelerated cost out measures drive organic margin expansion
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.600]   despite these demand changes.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:18.000]   Moving to slide 14 on renewables, there was a limited impact of COVID-19 in the first
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.720]   quarter, and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.320]   As we've said, we think about renewables in three distinct operating pools.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:33.720]   Starting with onshore wind, while we continue to deliver at record levels in the Americas,
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.560]   we are seeing supply chain disruption at our LM wind facilities, and we're monitoring
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.520]   key commercial milestones such as permitting and financing, which could potentially cause
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.000]   timing delays.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.280]   In offshore wind, certification for our industry leading turbine, the HolyotX, remains on track.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:59.480]   We're also on plan to start delivering on our 80 unit 6 megawatt commitments to EDF.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.760]   After completion of this project in 2021, we expect to start shifting production to the
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.760]   HolyotX.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:10.520]   We're also monitoring financial closure of 2020 deals.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:15.960]   Grid and Hydro, our two turnarounds, are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.840]   of our grid facilities now operating below full capacity, and at grid automation, we're
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:26.280]   also impacted by lower book to bill order conversion.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.640]   Across all three of these pools, we're increasing cost down and restructuring, and we've identified
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.440]   several hundred million dollars of additional actions.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.080]   Longer term, a lower cost structure will benefit renewables.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:43.360]   Relating to the global supply chain, we're focused on the safe reopening of our plants
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:48.800]   globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.960]   Looking forward, we're expecting a larger impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter,
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.920]   and by business, we're tracking 20 and 21 demand impact on progress collections and potential
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:04.880]   site delays in onshore wind, the risk of financing delays associated with deals at offshore,
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:11.920]   project site delays at grid and hydro, and the backlog at grid.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.080]   On slide 15, within GE Capital, our GCAS and insurance businesses are where we are feeling
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.400]   the largest impacts, so I'll keep my comments focused there.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:26.680]   First, GCAS is better positioned today than in previous downturns, with better asset quality,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:31.480]   less customer concentration, and more geographic diversity.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:37.160]   That said, we're preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments, as well as lease restructurings,
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:42.440]   and we've had approximately 80% of our customers seek short term deferrals.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:47.840]   As you may have seen, we've agreed with Boeing on a rebalancing of our 737 match order book.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:54.680]   Second, at insurance, market and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.360]   portfolio and reinvestment yields.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:03.600]   Therefore, we're deploying capital to capture market dislocation investment opportunities.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:08.880]   We're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.480]   And similar to the industrial segments, we're implementing incremental costs and cash actions.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:18.520]   Looking forward, we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales at GCAS and
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.600]   insurance.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:25.320]   Our seasoned teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.280]   So, to close, our priorities are clear.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:34.820]   We rapidly mobilized our team in the face of COVID-19, with our top priority being the
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.720]   health and safety of our employees.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:43.360]   And overall, the priorities we reviewed with you at the outlet call remain intact.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.680]   We're facing into our near term realities while continuing to manage GE for the long
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   term.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:55.200]   When the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century, our team is rising to the challenge
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.240]   with humility, transparency and focus.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.560]   We continue to deliver value for our customers, enabling air carriers to transport essential
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:11.520]   goods supplying vital health care equipment and keeping the lights on.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.280]   And while there are many unknowns, there will be another side.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.120]   Planes will fly again.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.800]   Health care will normalize and modernize.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.280]   And the world still needs more efficient resilient energy.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.400]   At the same time, we're embracing this new reality.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.920]   We're redefining winning and we're executing our plan.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:38.640]   The costs and cash and actions we've taken you through this morning are a major result.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.560]   These moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multi-year transformation to make GE a
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.680]   stronger, numberlier and more valuable company.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.360]   And I am confident that GE will emerge stronger.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.800]   With that, Steve, let's go to questions.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   Great.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:49:01.760]   Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.480]   again and ask one question and a follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.400]   Brandon, can you please open the line?
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.040]   Yes, thank you, sir.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.160]   We'll now begin the question and answer session.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.560]   If you have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.880]   If you'd like to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.280]   If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up your handset first before dialing.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.320]   Once again, if you have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.600]   And from vertical research, we have Jeff Sprague.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.880]   Please go ahead.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:35.880]   Thank you.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.880]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   Help everyone as well.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.800]   Thanks for all the great details.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.200]   Good morning, Jeff.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   Good morning.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on how you kind of view the asset
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:55.120]   quality of the contractual service agreements and the like.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.840]   There's a lot of assets there.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:02.560]   Obviously, there's at least a temporary impairment of cash flows.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.080]   How does that test work?
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.440]   Have you done it yet?
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:13.320]   And are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should be thinking about?
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:27.080]   Jeff, I think if we look at the service backlog, broadly just under $325 billion for the company,
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.160]   the vast majority of that $234 billion is in aviation.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.880]   I suspect that's where you're most focused.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:44.280]   We go through those backlog reviews and the CSA reviews on a regular basis.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:51.560]   What we've done here over the last, we call it the last seven, eight weeks, is really
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:59.520]   tighten and quicken the review process that we do with the businesses, both at aviation
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.520]   and at GCAS.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:08.000]   What we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest and, if you will, most accurate
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.440]   information possible with respect to customer risk given everything that's going on.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.920]   So we do that on a regular basis.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   We did that at the end of the first quarter in closing.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:30.040]   Much as we do every quarter, clearly, we've got a fluid situation and I think the modest
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:35.000]   charges that we took, the modest changes in the first quarter, clearly are going to play
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.080]   out as we go through the course of the year.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.880]   We can't really scope that for you today.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:47.880]   If you look at the CSA book in aviation, for example, as we went through the mechanics
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:54.520]   of the future billings, the future costs related to those billings, based on the information
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:00.680]   of the time, it was really just $100 million adjustment, non-cash, of course, which is
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:04.740]   why you see a little bit of the earnings, cash dynamic.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:12.000]   Certainly as we go forward, we're going to be updating those adjustments and, again,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.320]   we would expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines are doing with
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.320]   their planes.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:24.440]   But I think it's important to keep in mind, again, these are 10 to 15 year agreements
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:32.240]   as you know, and those adjustments are taken in the context of that particularly extended
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.480]   time period.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.240]   Great.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   Thanks for that.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:41.120]   Just as a follow-up, if I could, I know you don't want to get real precise on guidance,
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:47.480]   but you are pointing us to a further decline in cashflow in Q2, which isn't surprising
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:54.240]   quite frankly, but could you bracket that at all for us, what we should expect for Q2
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:00.660]   and any high-level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint?
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:10.000]   Jeff, I think that we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and didn't want to
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.540]   take an attempt at framing formal guidance here today in light of all of this flu and
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.440]   all of it is still evolving here.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:24.840]   I think the tack we took was really to try to share as much with you as we possibly could
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:31.280]   in terms of the April detail of business by business and acknowledge that we're going
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:37.720]   to see a more challenging second quarter here given the full impact of COVID and the like.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.120]   But beyond that, I think that's really where we are.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.520]   We know we've got to get to work on the cost and the cash actions.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:51.400]   That's why you see us doubling that activity and aviation, stepping it up elsewhere around
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.400]   the company.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:54:00.480]   So, the $2 billion of cost, the $3 billion of cash will clearly help us later on in the
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.960]   year as those actions take root.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.520]   But for today, I think that's really what we're -- that's what we know and that's what we're
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.520]   comfortable sharing.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.520]   All right.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   Thanks.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   Best of luck, Larry.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.520]   Thanks.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.520]   From Morgan Stanley, we have Josh Pokers-Winsky.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:23.520]   Please go ahead.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:28.520]   Josh, your line is open.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.520]   Josh.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.520]   It might be on mute.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.520]   Josh, you might be on mute.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.520]   Josh, are you there?
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:43.240]   Why don't we -- Brandon, let's move on and come back to Josh.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.240]   Okay.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.960]   Next question we have from Bank of America.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:46.960]   We have Andrew Olden.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.960]   Please go ahead.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:48.960]   Yes.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:49.960]   Good morning.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.960]   Can you hear me?
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:53.960]   Andrew.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.960]   Yep.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.960]   Andrew.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.960]   Very well.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:58.960]   Just a question.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:54:59.960]   I can hear you.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.920]   Thank you so much and good luck to everybody.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:12.040]   So, run rate minus 60% in terms of shop visits, 5% on CSAs, do you think you continue to trend
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:17.040]   at this level in the second quarter, or is there more downside?
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:25.720]   Andrew, the -- I think you're referring to page nine and the slide deck.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.720]   Deviation.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:34.600]   What we're seeing here -- yeah, I think this is what we're seeing right now, right?
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:42.000]   And given what the carriers have said publicly what they're doing, you know, we think these
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.800]   are -- these are good likely near-end run rates to share with you.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:53.400]   Again, we're not trying to offer up a definitive view as to the next several quarters, but
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:58.760]   this is -- you know, this is what we're seeing right now in the second quarter for sure.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:06.480]   And my follow-up question on spare engine sales, I think, minus 60%.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:11.840]   Have we lost these, or will these come back when the situation normalizes?
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:17.400]   Maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.880]   the next couple of years.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.440]   Thank you so much.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:34.360]   Andrew, we were ramping spares with both the LEAF 1A and the LEAF 1B as the narrowbody
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:42.720]   market was taking off, typical early in the life of an engine activity.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:50.120]   We are clearly seeing that soften, not necessarily going to zero as preparations are being made
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:54.640]   for the return to service to the max, right?
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:59.040]   I don't think that opportunity is lost, but I think, like much of what we're seeing in
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.840]   aviation broadly, it will be pushed out for a few years.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:09.960]   And again, I don't think we're taking a definitive view as to what year, what quarter things
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:18.520]   get back to, if you will, a normalized 2019 level, but we recognize the discussions out
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:23.680]   there about this being a multi-year recovery, gradual, slow.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   I think we're embracing that reality, and that applies really across the portfolio, both
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:36.320]   on the OE side, as well as the aftermarket spares included.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.320]   Thank you very much.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.320]   Follow the detail and stay safe.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.320]   Thank you.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:43.160]   From Milius Research, we have Scott Davis.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.640]   Please go ahead.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   Hey.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.200]   Good morning, guys, and welcome, Carolina.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.200]   Thank you.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.200]   Good morning, Larry.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:58:02.480]   Any way to think about the cost actions as it relates to kind of structural versus more
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.200]   kind of pandemic short-term related?
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.200]   Sure.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:17.400]   Well, I would say, Scott, as you well know, that when we're in a mode like this, you're
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:22.800]   moving as quickly as you possibly can almost anywhere that you can.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.400]   So if you look at what we've announced in aviation, the doubling of those activities
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:36.800]   today, the broadening across the company, if you look at the tally today, there is a decidedly
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:43.600]   short-term bias there that Carolina and I are going to be working with the CEOs over
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:49.300]   the coming weeks to transition to a more permanent action, right?
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:54.560]   If you look at what we did in aviation, for example, in terms of the temporary lack of
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:59:00.560]   works, that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure in that business on a variable
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:07.400]   basis to these shockingly fast changes in demand.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.600]   You might categorize that as temporary.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:16.000]   We need to work through the changes on a more permanent basis that are required in light
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.280]   of the length of the recovery that we're looking at.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:25.840]   So we have confidence in these numbers that we're sharing today, the $2 billion of costs,
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.320]   the $3 billion of cash.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:33.500]   There's a bit of a tactical bias today just given how fresh this is, but we will be leaning
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:39.360]   in toward making more of them permanent, recognizing that at the end of the day there will be a
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:47.600]   bit of a mix, be it head count related, discretionary spend on the cost side in addition to some
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:52.760]   of the work in capital and certainly the cap X reduction, the Carolina reference, the 25%
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.320]   reduction year on year.
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:04.560]   So a lot going on and by no means is these headlines today the end.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.600]   It's very much a work in progress.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:14.760]   Okay, that's helpful there, and we think the $20 billion came to you pretty much about
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:21.000]   perfect timing, but does that money just have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.840]   is for the year, or is it just such a big number?
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:31.000]   You can start to parse some of it out thinking in terms of whittling down some of the debt
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.440]   that you can manage.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:44.740]   Well it did come at a good time.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:45.740]   There's no question.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:53.200]   That's why we put the emphasis in the biopharmist setup on certainty.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.280]   We wanted to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the healthcare
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.440]   options.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.960]   Carolina, anything you want to add relative to managing liquidity versus leverage right
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.960]   here?
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:15.360]   Yeah, I think it's important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared to
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.360]   before COVID, and it's very important for us, of course leverage is important, but liquidity
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:26.800]   is very important, and we end the quarter with 47 billion cash, right, and that's really
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:33.520]   to cover 18 billion of the capital long term debt maturity now through 21, and actually
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:39.080]   after the April actions we are down to 13 billion of maturity for 2021, almost all of
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:45.840]   that in capital, and I would also say we expect to have around 20 billion in total credit
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.160]   lines going forward, and that's really in line with our risk appetite.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:57.120]   We have the new 15 billion three year RCF that I mentioned, and five billion in either will
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:02.200]   be 20 billion of credit lines, and I think we just say that we really intend to maintain
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.960]   a high level of cash, I would say to maximize flexibility, and that's why we're taking
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.880]   these actions also to do risk or balance sheet and basically prudently manage our liquidity
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:18.160]   in this very challenging external environment and time.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.240]   That makes sense, and thank you, and good luck to you guys.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.240]   Thank you.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.240]   Thanks, Scott.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.240]   Be well.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:31.320]   And let's try Josh Porkers-Winsky again from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead, sir.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.720]   Hi guys, can you hear me this time?
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:34.720]   Yes.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   Yes.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.040]   Clearly Josh, good morning.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.240]   Awesome, and hope everyone is as well, that go earlier comments.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.040]   Larry, can you just give us a sense, and I know you guys have data going back eons
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:54.440]   and aviation, how the impact of retirements and cannibalizations kind of make more of
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:03:00.600]   a U shape versus what the air traffic may look like.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:06.960]   Is there a natural lag between when folks start flying again and when shop visits can happen
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:13.600]   just as a function of kind of using up some of the runtime on otherwise idle assets?
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:23.040]   Well, Josh, certainly we have revisited the history of the team as well-versed in what
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.840]   we have seen in years past.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:36.360]   Not sure we've seen anything kind of on par with this, but there's no question that there's
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:42.880]   going to be a bias on the part of some as some of these fleet reductions play out to retire
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:51.680]   some of the older aircraft, and that will factor into the aftermarket, much like some
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:57.320]   of the dynamics around green time and how here in the short term folks try to preserve
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:01.960]   cash, carriers try to preserve cash in their business.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:08.880]   So I'm not sure that there is necessarily an exact model that captures what all the carriers
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.080]   in aggregate are going to do here, a model that offers great precision.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.760]   I think we do know that the combination of these factors is going to create pressure
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.080]   for us, for us here in the short term.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:28.280]   I think what's most important for our business really is cycles, much more so than revenue
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.760]   passenger miles.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:37.600]   And as we see schedules come back, as we work our way through the pandemic, that will put
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.680]   us back on I think better footing, but here in the short term, I think we're acknowledging
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.360]   that we're going to see shop visits and CSA buildings take on some real pressure due to
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.360]   the downturn.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.360]   Understood.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360]   Thanks.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.480]   I'll leave it there.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.160]   From JP Borgen, we have Steve Tusa.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.160]   Thanks, Josh.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.160]   Hey, guys.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.160]   Good morning.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.160]   Hey, Steve.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160]   Good morning.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:11.720]   In early March, you guys had that slide that showed two to four billion in free cash flow
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.320]   guidance, which is obviously off the table.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:20.440]   But you also talked about things growing in 21 and 22 and off that kind of $3 billion base.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:29.560]   I think most research and numbers I saw were kind of in that $6 billion range of free cash
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.000]   flow to kind of growth off of that level.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:40.480]   Are we still, like, are the out-year numbers still at all legit, or are you kind of withdrawing
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.360]   that long-term outlook as well?
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:53.680]   Steve, I think we have admittedly been focused on taking the right actions, both the cost,
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:59.960]   the cash, the balance sheet actions here in the short term in the face of this unprecedented
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.600]   pandemic.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.320]   We've taken guidance off for the year.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:12.160]   We're not putting it back on today, just given the undue uncertainty of it all.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:18.160]   So I don't think we're trying to get out any further than that.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.840]   I appreciate the question, but I think for purposes of today, we're really just trying
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.200]   to frame for folks what we're seeing.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:31.680]   But that said, however long it takes us to work through this, I think we feel very good
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:40.320]   about our ability to come out stronger and get back on a positive cash flow growth trajectory.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.880]   Carolina, anything you would add to that?
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:52.240]   Well, no, I think it's important to acknowledge that by taking out costs now, and part of
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.720]   it being structural, that gives us sort of – as well as mitigating the decrementals
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:03.880]   that help improving the incrementals, the outer years, I mean, that will depend on the
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:09.680]   recovery on the industries as well, so that's, I would say, almost impossible to speak to
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.680]   today.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.680]   Right.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.760]   And I guess how much on that structural offside?
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.760]   Steve?
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:21.560]   No, I'm just – just one other point, I think, worth mentioning, and I think what
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:26.880]   we're acknowledging here is that assistance played out in March and what we're seeing
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   already in April.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.880]   Right.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.720]   It really is hitting us from a mixed perspective hard.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.720]   Our highest margin businesses are really feeling it here.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:44.120]   I would think that on the recovery, we would see it swing the other way.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:52.240]   So when we get back and come off a bottom, we should have positive mix effect, really
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:58.120]   across the board, particularly in aviation and healthcare.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.400]   Your second question, Steve, is relative to the cost actions and how much are permanent?
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:04.120]   How much?
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.120]   Not permanent?
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.120]   I know.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.120]   I guess how much is that going to cost you?
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:13.040]   I mean, like, you know, to come up with $2 to $3 billion of cost and cash, you know,
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.280]   you've done – you cut your restructuring last year pretty significantly and you needed
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.680]   a couple hundred million in the first quarter.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.400]   I mean, most companies kind of one-for-one, how much is this stuff going to cost you this
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.960]   year on a cash basis?
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:37.840]   I think what we have said previously is we were going to be down off of last year from
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.320]   an expense and from a cash perspective.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:45.960]   I think we're probably going to end up more or less in line, right?
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:52.800]   Keep in mind that some of the cost actions like furloughs don't carry restructuring charge
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.080]   with that, right?
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.080]   Because they aren't permanent.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.520]   So part of what we're trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary costs.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:05.800]   But all the while, if we can make more structural moves, we want to make sure we've got room
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.800]   to do that.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:11.560]   And I'd say right now, assume that it would be relatively flat year on year, but as Carolina
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:18.000]   indicated in her remarks, we want to try to do more if we can.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   Great.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   All right.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   Thanks a lot.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   Best of luck, guys.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   Thanks, Dave.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.520]   From UBS, we have Marcus Bitterbier.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520]   Please go ahead.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   Hi.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.140]   Good morning, Larry, Caroline and Steve.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.000]   Let me maybe follow up on the – Marcus, good morning.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.440]   Hey, good morning.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:43.960]   During the year, so in your 10Q, you referenced the EATA numbers of 48 percent RPK reduction.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.800]   And I know obviously flight hours and RPKs are two different stories, but is that sort
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:55.000]   of a kind of scenario that you're flying through internally?
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.400]   And I'm just trying to get a sense of what that would mean if we look at our sort of
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:05.560]   like 19 aviation cash as a baseline sort of like where, you know, on that type of scenario
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.160]   we could end up particularly, you know, looking at sort of what you've mentioned in your
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:16.380]   preparedness remarks that you have I think 62 percent of engines built ahead of shop
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:20.840]   visit 1, which arguably are the engines that are on the narrowbodies coming back first
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.520]   because they're probably the youngest in the fleet.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.520]   Right.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.520]   Right.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.160]   Just trying to get a sense for within the year how you're thinking about that.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:42.280]   Well, I think that given what we highlighted relative to the April experience and the near
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:48.960]   term projection of that, there's no question that we're going to continue to see the pressure
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.880]   on cash at aviation that we've seen here of late.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880]   Right.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:01.560]   So we are undoubtedly our biggest headwind.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:11.000]   No, sure, but you know, shop visit, we heard sort of the numbers that you said, but did
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:19.840]   you do sort of internal stress tests around where you could end up or is that just something
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.800]   that you said it's too early to comment?
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:35.420]   No, no, no, there's plenty of planning for, again, an extended slowdown here.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:39.600]   We're embracing this reality to the fullest extent possible.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.040]   We are not expecting this to bounce back in the near term.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.520]   So we flag in the queue the IOTA numbers.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.640]   We also reference others.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.920]   You see it in our own departure data here in April, right?
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:54.920]   We are way down.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.920]   That has a direct feed in the shop visits, CSA billings, and the like.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:08.840]   So we're adapting to this new environment, confident that it will recover, so we're simply
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:20.080]   not trying to assume the pressure abates anytime soon witness the cost and the cash actions
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080]   that we're taking.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.080]   Sure.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   Okay.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.080]   No, I appreciate that.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:30.840]   And maybe as a follow-up quickly on the capital side, do you anticipate any change in the capital
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.060]   support there for insurance in particular?
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.760]   You referenced that a little bit in the prepared remarks.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.160]   I think two billion is sort of the current number.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.440]   How are you thinking about that at the moment?
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:52.920]   On the parent support to capital and on the insurance, let's take a step back then.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:13:00.400]   So in 19, the capital had an inclusion from DU of four billion, right?
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:07.480]   And the estimate for this year is two billion on insurance funding.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:13.280]   And those two billion, you know, they're significantly lower than the before.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.040]   We estimate that the parent will need to support roughly in mind with this.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.200]   Some variables are still open, and that depends on G capital itself, right?
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:27.640]   The G capital earnings, the LR2, the capital ending assets, liquidity level, but basically
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.400]   it's about two billion as it looks now.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:37.120]   And I would also say going forward, anticipating a follow-up, we do continue to anticipate further
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:43.120]   funding, and that would be, again, through a combination of G capital itself with our
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:48.920]   assets, liquidity, and the future earnings, and on top of that, possible capital contributions
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.920]   from G.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.320]   Thank you.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.560]   Tom Cohen and Company, we have Gautam Khanna.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.560]   Please go ahead.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.560]   Thank you.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.560]   Good morning, guys.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.560]   Good morning.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.560]   Two questions.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:15.880]   So at aviation, it sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up, the spares business, the
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:23.920]   aftermarket, the $15 billion commercial, aftermarket business will lag ASM growth because of a younger
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:31.000]   fleet emerging, you know, a surge of use serviceable material and the like, hard outs, and obviously
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.240]   lower spares provisioning as the OE rates come down 30 to 50 percent.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:43.920]   I guess first question is, when do you anticipate aviation-free cash flow getting to break even?
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:50.600]   Is it even possible before calendar 22 in that type of environment?
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:58.420]   And then I have a follow-up.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:04.160]   I'm not -- I'm not sure we would buy into the premise per se, right?
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:14.200]   I mean, we are a cycles business much more so than any other indicator, and those cycles
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:18.040]   are going to have to come back before the passengers do.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:23.440]   As you mitigate the age of the fleet, we'll help us over time.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:30.080]   There could be some short-term headwinds, but we'll see how that plays out.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:37.960]   I think what we're acknowledging here is that we've been hit from a free cash perspective
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:45.760]   in our -- kind of our biggest and best cash generator at aviation, but we're really not
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:56.400]   getting into much more in terms of the free cash forecast on a multiyear basis.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400]   It's just too soon.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:03.680]   There's just too many moving pieces for us to be that forward leaning at this point.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:04.680]   We wish we could be.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.600]   It's just not where we are.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.600]   Okay.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.320]   And just a follow-up, you know, obviously 2020 is a tough year.
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:19.520]   We're going to have some cash burn, 2021 unclear, but certainly doesn't seem like an aviation.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:24.040]   We're going to have a strong recovery.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.000]   So as we emerge from this, we're going to have, you know, more leverage.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.880]   And I guess the question is, you guys have made some asset sales to deleverage.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:41.600]   What else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster?
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.960]   Is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore that's
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:52.560]   different than what you've done over the past year?
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.280]   Thank you.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.240]   Well, I would --
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240]   You made that --
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:06.920]   I'm not sure I would say that there's a lot that is -- oh, please, Carolina.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:14.720]   Well, I was going to say that to do things that we haven't done in the last couple of
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.720]   years.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:26.760]   Well, I would just say at a high level, we are committed to our deleveraging target
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:30.080]   of less than two and a half times on the industrial side.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:35.400]   And I think you've seen us make a lot of progress year to date, which I hope underscores the
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:39.640]   seriousness of that objective, both on the GE side, right?
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:45.960]   I think it's $7 billion of debt reductions in the quarter and that capital, I think it's
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:51.080]   up to $10 on a year-to-date basis, given some of the things we did in April.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:58.400]   Clearly, it's going to take us a while longer here to hit those targets, like I suspect
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.560]   most companies.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.640]   But in terms of doing anything new or different, I think we're going to continue to try to
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:11.840]   run these businesses as best we can, be as disciplined as we can on the capital front,
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:16.800]   be smart and thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations, like pension as you've
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.040]   seen us, relative to the plan design and some of the settlement options.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.640]   So I'm not sure there are necessarily new plays per se, but we'll continue to look at
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.600]   every and every option available to continue to strengthen the company, strengthen the balance
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.760]   sheet, bring those leverage levels down in the face of COVID-19.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:43.440]   Caroline, I'm sorry, I jumped in there, did anything to add there?
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:48.560]   I would just add to the leverage comment also the liquidity that at times like this, you
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.040]   know, you do look at the liquidity, and I think it's important to say that we really
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.920]   want to maintain a high level of cash maximizing flexibility, and you have seen the de-risking
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:05.840]   activities that we have made to sort of push out the debt in the further years, so we keep
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.240]   optionality.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.240]   Thank you.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:15.160]   Yeah, but I think to that it meant it's just important for us all to remember we ended the
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:21.880]   quarter with 47 billion of liquidity on the back of the biopharma action and some of the
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:28.880]   other things that we have done, so we'll continue to be nimble and flexible, mindful of our obligations
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.640]   and our reality.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:37.080]   Okay, from Barclays, we have Julian Mitchell.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.080]   Please go ahead.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.880]   Hi, good morning.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:51.080]   Maybe just the question around the working capital dynamics in the free cash flow at
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:58.480]   aviation, I guess there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:05.520]   down draft, you get a working capital cash offset to an extent and then it reverses whenever
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.760]   the sales come back.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:13.440]   Could you just update us on how you see the working capital cash impact at G aviation
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:19.200]   sort of in the early stages now in this downturn, what you would expect to happen to working
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:25.680]   capital when things recover, and if there's any major difference on the cash dynamics
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:33.680]   of the power-by-the-hour type service relative to the ad hoc spares activity in aviation?
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:40.560]   Julian, I would say…
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:55.360]   Yeah, with respect to working capital, I think our primary challenge is really in the
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.480]   inventory at aviation, right?
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:04.760]   We came into this year knowing we were going to have to adjust to a different schedule
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:13.120]   with the MAX chasing the step up at Airbus with the 320neo while dealing with a good
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:20.520]   bit of pass-through on the commercial side, both OE and aftermarket, while having pretty
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.800]   good military demand to contend with.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:31.800]   That all gets reset here, and one of the real pressures we saw from a cash flow perspective
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:38.080]   was an inventory at aviation in the quarter, so that's where we're going to be most focused
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:44.240]   trying to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies, adjust to the reduced production schedules,
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:51.360]   the lower aftermarket requirements while continuing to take care of the military business.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:59.240]   That's a complex supply chain undertaking, but the team, as you can imagine, is keenly
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:04.600]   focused on using some of the lean tools, working with our supply base, to make sure that we
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:13.520]   not only take the cost out of the business, but bring those inventory levels down in light
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:17.680]   of current demand.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:23.720]   What should we expect, so I guess I understand what you're saying.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.800]   There's a second part of your question.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.800]   I may have missed that.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:34.200]   Yes, it was right to understand, I guess, you know, in aviation you have the drop in
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.280]   EBITDA in a downturn, then the recovery in EBITDA in the early part of the upturn.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:46.200]   I was just trying to understand on what's in capital, is that cash impact counter cyclical
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:52.960]   or is it pro cyclical, so you're getting a working capital outflow through the downturn
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:23:02.560]   as well as the EBITDA decline?
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.680]   I understand the high level dynamic there that you're alluding to.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.880]   I think right now the simple reality of aviation given the pressures and the cross currents
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.800]   is that it is a negative and we need to work to improve it.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:23.440]   How much of a tailwind could it be kind of at this point in the cycle?
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.240]   I think it's too early to tell.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:32.720]   We've got to get on the improvement path first, Julian, to be able to take that potential
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.160]   and deliver it in the financials as a reality.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.160]   Thank you.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:44.720]   One question was just around the operational issues, so I think it sounds like the cost
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:50.160]   out tailwind should build through the year, but in Q1 you had some operational issues
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:56.800]   in power on the service side, you know, steep decrementals, even with the fixed costs down
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:02.280]   16%, renewables, the margins were down despite a big revenue increase.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:08.120]   So I guess what's the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:13.760]   these cost savings over the balance of the year?
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:20.360]   Well, I think you have to take it business by business, right?
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:28.360]   If you look at what happened in power, clearly the push out by customers because of their
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:34.680]   own site restrictions and by us on the back of the travel restrictions really pushed a
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:42.280]   lot of high margin revenue out of the quarter and probably out of the first half.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:52.080]   That was on top of some cost pressures of our own making which we need to improve upon.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:25:01.760]   But I think in power, I believe that the team is doing a very nice job working off the so-called
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.120]   inheritance taxes, driving real cost improvements, you see that in the head count reductions
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.560]   here in the first quarter.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:13.360]   And as we get to a more normalized service environment, I think you'll continue to see
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:17.480]   that turnaround continue to take flight.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.560]   I think in renewables, Julian, it's a different dynamic.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:28.760]   Yes, we had phenomenal revenue growth in the quarter, double the onshore turbine deliveries
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.080]   here in the U.S., got a little bit of a better price, got about a point of price, which is
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:39.840]   encouraging to see, but it is by nature a very low gross margin business.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.360]   So the growth is in high calorie, unfortunately.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:49.360]   We had a few – well, we figure one offs, but they're not one offs until they go away
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.440]   permanently cost and execution issues.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.560]   All the while, the turnarounds in hydro and grid are, I think, moving forward, but it's
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.560]   early days.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:07.040]   And they have a number of inheritance taxes that will take a few years to work through.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.400]   So I think the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate those turnarounds
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.920]   in power and renewables.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.440]   They're dealing with different dynamics in the respective businesses.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.760]   And that's really why I think I have the confidence to say that you should expect the
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:29.840]   decremental margins sequentially to improve that the restructuring and the cost actions
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:35.520]   should present themselves in improved decrementals in the back half.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:39.440]   But we've got work to do to make that happen.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.440]   Great.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.440]   Thank you.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.320]   From Wolf Research, we have Nigel Kohi.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.320]   Please go ahead.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.320]   Thanks, Julian.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.320]   Thanks.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.320]   Good morning, everyone.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.360]   And Karina, great to see you on board.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:27:00.000]   So, look, we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional color in the queue.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.600]   So, Larry, is it now a base case that industrial free cash flow will be negative and maybe
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:13.000]   could just address the risk of significant cash burn this year, or is there enough on
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.040]   the cost outs and the working capital side to maybe mitigate some of that pressure and
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:23.120]   keep industrial free cash relatively steady?
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:31.840]   I think what we're trying to share this morning, Nigel, is that probably three things.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:40.840]   One, we've been hit hard and fast here in some of our most important, highest margin
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:50.200]   businesses, be it aviation and services particularly, gas power services, PDX in health care.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:56.160]   We think that that gets worse before it gets better, particularly here in the second quarter
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.920]   with a full effect.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.120]   It's uncertain as to how things play out from here.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:11.040]   We're going to acknowledge that uncertainty, hence the pulling of the guide, but we're not
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.800]   going to sit back and hope that it all passes.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:19.280]   We're not going to take the view that we've got a sharp V-Bounce coming, hence the $2 billion
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:23.880]   of cost actions we've talked about and the $3 billion of cash actions.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:30.760]   We're going to do everything we possibly can to control our destiny here without impairing
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:36.320]   the long-term value and the long-term trajectory of our company.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.120]   We're telling you what we know today.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:44.720]   We wish we knew more, but that is really the state of play right now and the approach the
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.400]   headset that we're taking to it.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.400]   Okay.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.400]   I appreciate that, Larry.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.400]   Thanks.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:53.240]   I thought one of the real highlights of the quarter was the underlying strength of the
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:59.640]   healthcare margins, even ex-biopharma, especially given some of the headwinds you face in there.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:03.320]   You're seeing strength in small equipments and pressure in Beguine.
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.560]   How does that mix look though?
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:10.040]   When you look at the mix on smaller patient monitoring equipment, et cetera, versus the
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:18.040]   Beguine, how does that equipment mix play out to the margins?
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:28.960]   Well, we certainly -- I think the key thing to keep in mind, Nigel, is the big iron certainly
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.840]   got hit.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:42.280]   The lower ticket, the lower price point, patient monitors, ventilators, and the like certainly
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:50.100]   got quite a boost, but it's a small part of the business.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:53.480]   So there was a little bit of mix there, but not a lot.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:30:00.120]   It was really more a function, frankly, of the team doing a nice job more broadly recognizing
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:09.200]   that absent biopharma, we needed to tend to the core cost structure in all its form in
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.240]   the HCS business, right?
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.960]   We've been growing healthcare, biopharma leading the way.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:18.760]   We got some good margin support from that business the last several years.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:25.120]   Well, now as we think about the $17 billion core, the team's really, I think, put their
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.960]   sights the last couple of quarters on growing that business, growing it with a creative
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:34.960]   margin, and it's really the cumulative effect that I think you see a bit here in the first
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:38.760]   quarter before we got hit.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.200]   They got hit a little bit later, not as much.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:44.640]   You'll see more of that, unfortunately, here in the second quarter, but I think you've
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:50.840]   got a team who thinks that like many other MedTech companies, they can load a mid single
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:57.280]   digits over time and put more digital into the mix, better costs.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:02.200]   That should give us the opportunity to grow with a creative margin along the lines of
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.080]   what Kieran laid out in December.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:09.360]   I have no less conviction about their ability to do that today than we did when we made
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.960]   that presentation, again mindful that we've got some gyrations here in the near term to
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.960]   deal with.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.960]   Right.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:17.960]   Okay.
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:18.960]   Thanks, Larry.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:19.960]   Good luck.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:20.960]   Thanks, Nigel.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:21.960]   Thanks, Nigel.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:27.080]   We are at the bottom of the hour, so Brandon, we're at the bottom of the hour, so we could
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.720]   just take one more question.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:29.720]   Sure.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.640]   From RBC Capital Markets, we have Dean Dre, please go ahead.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:34.640]   Thank you.
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:35.640]   Good morning, everyone.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:40.800]   Good health, and add my welcome to Carolina.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:41.800]   Thank you.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.800]   Hey, just ...
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.800]   Good morning, Dean.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.800]   Good morning.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:52.040]   Just two questions, both aviation, a lot of discussion about structural cost out, and
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:59.240]   Larry, be interested in how have you balanced the structural cost out in aviation with
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:06.600]   rifts and balancing the rifts and furloughs versus how you might be compromising the ability
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:10.840]   to bounce back when it does ramp back up?
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.520]   So that's the first question.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:16.800]   And then the second one, just to make sure I heard it correctly, did you quantify the
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.520]   leap cancellations in the quarter?
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:22.400]   I know there's delivery deferrals.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:28.240]   Our experience in 2008 was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations because
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:31.240]   customers would lose that nonrefundable deposit.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:34.120]   So what's the expectation here in terms of engine cancellations?
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.680]   That's it for me.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.680]   Thank you.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:51.880]   Dean, maybe I'll take the first part of that, and perhaps Carolina can take the second.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:58.080]   I think we are mindful, ever mindful, that there will be a recovery.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:01.060]   And we want to be well positioned for it, because it's going to be a very good business
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:06.360]   for GE for four decades.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:16.320]   But I think we are really trying to, again, embrace our reality and take the cost actions
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:23.200]   in the aftermarket business, and more broadly, at aviation, mindful that we've got a period
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:29.640]   of time here of an unknown duration, but it's not going to be measured in months, right,
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:33.320]   where that business is going to be under considerable pressure.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:41.440]   So after a period of time, as the aftermarket has grown as it has the last decade, this
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:46.880]   is going to give us an opportunity to rethink, to consolidate.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:53.960]   All the while mindful of our obligations to customers, the nature of how the footprint
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:58.160]   has changed, the changes that are probably still coming.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.140]   So there are a number of variables.
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:05.200]   It's very much a work in progress as well, but I think we've got line of sight to build
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:14.320]   on some of the temporary action to take permanent action to make sure that we have a lean cost
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:21.480]   structure with adequate capacity to come out of the downturn here, well positioned to
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.200]   perform both for customers and for investors.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.200]   Thank you.
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:30.240]   We'll now turn it back to Steve Whitaker for closing remarks.
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:37.080]   I do want to answer the question on, yeah, second question.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.080]   Go ahead, Caroline.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.080]   Yeah, I will.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.080]   Go ahead.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.080]   Go ahead, Caroline.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.080]   Yeah, you were right.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:49.000]   I mentioned that in my notes there, that in our backlog, which was flat sequentially
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:56.120]   and up 22 percent versus prior, that did include roughly 200 loop 1B unit order translations
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:59.200]   in the quarter.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:05.200]   I would say the progress really funds a very small so far, but on top of that we also saw
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.200]   GCAS, right?
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:11.440]   So we have GCAS cancellations of 69 aircrafts in April, so that will be reflected in the
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:16.880]   second quarter revenues and backlog.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.120]   Great.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.080]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:28.280]   I know it's a long call and a busy day, so if you need more, just reach out to us and
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.280]   best of luck.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.280]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.280]   This concludes today's conference.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.280]   Thank you for joining.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.280]   You may now disconnect.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:37.780]   Connect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star 1 on your telephone.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   If you require any further assistance, please press star 0.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vic Kinney, Head of Investor Relations.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Thank you. Please go ahead.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I'm Vic Kinney, Ingersoll Rand Investor Relations Leader,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   and with me today are Vicente Rinal, Chief Executive Officer, and Emily Weaver, Chief Financial Officer.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Our earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which will be referenced during the call,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   In addition, a replay of this morning's conference call will be available later today.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that certain of the statements on this call are forward-looking in nature
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   For more details on these risks, please refer to our annual report on Form 10(k) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   and our current report on Form 8(k) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2020,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   which are available on our website at www.irco.com.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Additional disclosure regarding forward-looking statements is included on slide 2 of the presentation.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   in our slide presentation and in our release, which are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I will also remind everyone that in both our earnings release and today's presentation,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   we have included both as-reported financials and supplemental financial information to assist with analysis and comparatives.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   The as-reported financials only include the Ingersoll-Ran industrial segment results
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   from the closing date of the transaction on February 29, 2020,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and the supplemental financial information provides results as the transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2018
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   to provide a full quarter of comparable results.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Turning to slide 3, on today's call, we will provide an update on the top priorities of the company in the current operating environment
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as review our first quarter total company and segment highlights.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We will conclude today's call with the Q&A session.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   At this time, I will now turn over to Vicente Rinal, Chief Executive Officer.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Thanks, Vic, and good morning to everyone on the call.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I would like to kick off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by COVID-19
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and all the dedicated healthcare workers, public responders, and volunteers who are on the front lines
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   all over the world battling this pandemic.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll-Ran employees around the world.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The pictures on slide 4 are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   who have adapted to the realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Every day, I hear of new examples of our businesses providing mission-critical products to our customers,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   one thing I am sure about is that Ingersoll-Ran will continue to keep the safety of our communities
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and serving our customers at the center of everything we do,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Moving to slide 5, I would like to grant everyone on the critical priorities we're following during these challenging times.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   When we close the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   that within a matter of weeks we will be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruptions to our customers supply chain
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   and the day-to-day operations of the company.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us plan, accelerate,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   and adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers, and the community.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   through these uncertain times.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And finally continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The strength of Ingersoll-Ran team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge from this crisis
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   as a stronger and more unified company.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine that we call IRX
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   are really at the heart of how we operate as a company, especially in these unprecedented times.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   During the integration process, we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   One that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   This purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams leave on a daily basis creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll-Ran Execution Excellence process.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll-Ran.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Turning to slide seven, I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis since it has been swift and focused around two major components.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   First is the health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And second, business continuity not only within operations but across a larger supply chain.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Starting first with health and safety, we activated our COVID-19 tax force in February
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   and had a full coordinated company approach in early March just weeks after the creation of the new company.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Our execution approach has served us very well as we are able to quickly implement enhanced site safety protocols
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And it is encouraging that our quick actions have been successful as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst our more than 17,000 global employees.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   But it's more than just implementing safety protocols.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It's also about supporting and engaging the employee base.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   As a result, we have implemented a number of measures including a global outreach program to facilitate employee feedback.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Not only did our team volunteer to take individual pay cuts, furloughs and forgo vacation time this year, they have thoughtful in-depth suggestions,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   many of which were actively implementing today.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   From a business continuity perspective, starting first with our operations, as we previously communicated,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   we have seen plans largely in China, Italy and India impacted due to COVID-19.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   China was largely impacted in the month of January and February and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   as things are now largely back to normal.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Italy and India saw about a two month lag to China, with operations being impacted in late March and into April.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And in this time, our sites around the globe are 98% operational,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   The supply chain has seen a similar trend, as the impact in China is largely behind us and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   The Americas and India regions are stabilizing, as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   In the past few weeks, we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Much like our operations, India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of May, when governmental restrictions begin to ease.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   We are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Let me tell you about what we're doing here.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Starting with slide 8, through the use of IRX, we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over $350 million,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   with increases across all major savings categories, and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   As a reminder, we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost energies of approximately $250 million by the end of year 3 after closing.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energies and the associated stand-up of the new company.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters, the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   and that is exactly what we have done.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   We have dramatically increased the pace, having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   with approximately $70 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   The majority of these savings are coming from headcount actions, already taking in the past two months,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   In addition, we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative, with RFQs for nearly one-third of our historical direct materials fan base already launched,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   In total, we're now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   which is approximately three times higher than the original year 1 expectation of 10% to 15% realization.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   We're keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three-year timeframe at this time
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement, and I have to be given the current environment.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It is not only the structural cost that we have taken out,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short-term cost reductions to protect margins.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So let's move to Slide 9 to talk about that.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   In Q1, despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro-forma basis,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   we were able to limit adjusted EBITDA incrementals to less than 30%.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   With the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   we expect that these additional actions will yield $40 to $50 million of incremental cost savings in the P&L this year,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   We will continue to re-evaluate on a monthly basis,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   and if the man environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   While we are making some tough decisions to control costs,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   one area that we are not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Much like we did back in 2015 at Georgia Denver,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains and new product opportunities,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   we are following the same playbook today.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as demand generation and our IoT platforms.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   This is all part of the strategy to play offense,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   now especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Moving to slide 10, let me talk about liquidity.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   At the time of the merger, we took the opportunity to reprise our legacy debt
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   while placing the new $1.9 billion firm loan to close the transaction.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   All of our debt is a term loan B structure,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   with very attractive pricing as the U.S. components are LIBOR+175
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   and the Euro component is a EuroBOR+200.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The term loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   and there are no maturities until 2027.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   as we finish the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and over $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   As we look ahead, we continue to see several opportunities to undo cash
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Opportunities exist across working capital and cash taxes
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense in the second half of the year
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by September of 2020.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   given the attractive rate and covenant environment.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Turning to slide 11, our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   as we're building the culture of Inglisle Rand with our employees at the core.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   and at the same time we will position the company for future growth both organically
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   and through opportunistic targeted bolt-on M&A.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Our business operates in a very fragmented market
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and importantly our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   is taking shape as we launch several of our ESG oriented initiatives already.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Overall we have several value creation levers as we look ahead
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain macroeconomic landscape.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   I will now turn it over to Emily to work you through the financials. Emily?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Thanks Vicente. On slide 12 you will see the as reported financials for the company.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   As a reminder the reported financials include three months of legacy Gardner Denver
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and one month of the legacy Inglisle Rand industrial segment in Q1 2020
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   As a result the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Other than to mention that the as reported net income in the quarter
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   includes $197 million of amortization, acquisition, restructuring and other adjustments
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Turning to slide 13, to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   as if it had happened as of January 1, 2018.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   From a total company perspective, FX suggested revenue and orders declined 14%
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Regionally we saw notable declines in Asia Pacific as well as sharp declines
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   in the US and Europe towards the end of the quarter, most notably in the ITNS segment.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   This led book to bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   The company delivered 208 million of adjusted EBITDA
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   a decline of 24% driven mostly by the volume declines in ITNS
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and the expected downturn in the HPS segment.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4% down 200 basis points from last year.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   However, our proactive cost controls within the business limited decrementals to 29%.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   the legacy Gardner Denver business delivered 97 million
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately 100 million
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   The legacy IR businesses delivered 51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   as opposed to a combined 60 million for January and February.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Moving to slide 14, free cash flow for the quarter was $60 million on an as reported basis
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   including $8 million of CAPEX.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   The Q1 free cash flow includes $63 million of outflows related to the transaction
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   comprised of 38 million of synergy delivery and standup related costs
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   and another 25 million of transaction fees.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   We also paid $38 million of debt issuance costs in the quarter
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   bringing our total transaction related outflows in the quarter to $100 million.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   From a leverage perspective we finished at 2.6 times
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and while we do expect to see some short term increase to leverage
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   we have shown the ability to delever historically.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   As you can see on the right side of the page
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   we'll remain extremely disciplined on cash
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   with what you have seen historically.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Specifically internal reinvestments for growth, prudent debt pay down
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   and opportunistic bolt on M&A.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   We have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segment.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Vicente?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Thanks Emily.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Starting first with industrial technologies and services on slide 15
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   the IT&S segment first quarter adjusted order intake was $889 million
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   down 9% versus per year excluding effects.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Adjusted revenue in the quarter was $796 million
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   down 17% excluding effects
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and leading to a book to bill ratio of 1.12 times.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   From a regional perspective
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Asia Pacific revenues were down in the mid 30s
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   with Europe down 15%
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   and Americans down 7% all excluding effects.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   We use this trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   meaning that the APAC declining Q1 is what we expect to see
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   in Americans and the media in the near term.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   but we're staying highly active with the man generation activities
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   and pricing controls but we continue to demonstrate disciplining price
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   generating over 1% in the quarter.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   While these markets are more opaque than historically
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   we're using our unique data acquisition strategy
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   to map order trends and remain agile
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   in serving our customers in the current environment.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We break this out into two areas, aftermarket and original equipment.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   For aftermarket, a leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   that are connected to our remote monitoring systems.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   In America and Europe we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   in the last few weeks of March of nearly 30%
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   with some recovery in the past few weeks of April.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   We're now using this as a way to know where our service teams need to focus
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   which is approximately 50% of the compressor business today.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   For original equipment we're using the man generation leads.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   We said in the past that the man gen was a leading indicator of orders
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   With more than a thousand leads per week
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   we have a lot of commercial insight in our system.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   What we saw in the later weeks of March was a drop of 30%
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   versus what we saw earlier in the quarter
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   with similar trends in America and Europe.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   but still approximately 20 to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers and vacuums
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   so orders down in the mid to high single digits.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   We have spoken about third party industry reports in the past
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   According to a leading third party report
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   the market in the US was down mid single digits in dollars in the first quarter.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Garnet Denver branded products were flat
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and Ingersoll brand branded product was down high single digits.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   But when you look into the details you see the power of the two companies.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Garnet Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   while Ingersoll brand took share on high horsepower compressors.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   as well as the direct and indirect channels that both companies have.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Power tools and lift which is part of this segment had a very tough quarter
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   with orders and revenue down both over 20%.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   that online retailers typically make in the first quarter
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   to support first half of the year revenue.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   However, this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   many online retailers switch their focus to household essentials.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Moving to non-GAAP at Yostar Ibiza
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   ITNS delivered 135 million dollars in the quarter
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   which was down 25%.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Non-GAAP at Yostar Ibiza margin was 17%
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   which was down 150 business points from the prior year.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Other cost mitigation efforts helped limit incremental to 25%
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   in a segment that typically has basic fundamentals of 35% to 40%
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   before cost actions.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Moving to slide 16 to the precision and science technology segment.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Overall, the segment had solid performance in this economic environment
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   as adjusted orders were 280 million up 2% XFX.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Adjusted revenue was 192 million down 9% XFX.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   On strong prior year comes up 12% XFX growth
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   and shipment delays due to COVID-19.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   In the first quarter we saw orders growth high single digits
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   in the legacy medical pump business.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   As we are leading key player in several applications
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   like oxygen concentrators, respirators and liquid handling.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   at the bottom of the page.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Our teams have been working 24/7
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   providing modified solutions that can be used
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   down 2% XFX with the majority due to COVID lockdowns
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   in January and February in China
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and towards the end of the quarter in India.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   and orders activity across many of the product lines and regions
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   due to the niche applications in water and chemicals
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   in the more industrial end markets.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Moving to non-gap adjusted EBITDA,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   PNST delivered 53 million dollars in the quarter
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   which is down 6%.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Non-gap adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   up 120 basis points
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   driven by strong cost controls
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   and productivity leading to incremental margins of only 15%.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Moving to slide 17
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   and the specialty vehicle technology segment,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   the priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   in a profitable manner.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   We see that this segment can expand margins
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   with the use of the same IRX tools we have used across other segments
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Adjusted orders were 213 million dollars
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   and adjusted revenue was 185 million dollars
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   up 8% and 7% respectively
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   with a boost to build of 1.15.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Growth was driven by the strength in golf, connectivity
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and consumer products.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   The business saw strong double digit order momentum
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   in early January and February
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   when the pandemic hit the U.S. we saw sharp decline
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   in the second half of March.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   What there is a lot to be excited about
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   we're expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   for a couple reasons.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   First, last year was a tough comp
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   where some product was shifted to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And two, the business is not immune to this current environment.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   While April orders were down year-over-year
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   We feel this is driven by a couple factors.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   First, in the consumer product line
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   the team people took quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   widely used in the legacy industrial businesses
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   And second, with the work we have done
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   we were able to remain open
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   while some of our competitors were closed.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Moving to non-gap adjusted EBITDA
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   specialty vehicles deliver 18 million dollars in the quarter
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   down 1 percent.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Non-gap adjusted EBITDA was 9.9 percent
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   which was down 80 basis points
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   due to strategic growth investments and product mix.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Moving to slide 18 and the high pressure solution segment
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   the business performed above our expectations
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   in a tough operating environment
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   with adjusted orders of 84 million dollars
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   and adjusted revenues of 96 million dollars
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   down 26 percent and 29 percent respectively.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   As expected the revenue base in the business
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   was nearly 90 percent after market
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   and the team executed very well commercially
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   with sequential adjusted orders up 6 percent
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and sequential adjusted revenues up 26 percent
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   We continue to see shared gain opportunities in after market
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and specifically consumables where we saw orders
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   and revenue up double digit sequentially.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   This allowed us to deliver non-gap adjusted EBITDA
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   of 24 million dollars and margins of 24.6 percent
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   which was down from last year level of 30.8 percent
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   but sequentially better by over 400 basis points.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   As we pivot to the second quarter in the rest of the year
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   a key leading indicator for this business
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   has always been activity and intensity.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   We can measure that in multiple ways
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   but the simplest form is the number of fleets
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   operational in the market.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   As a reminder each fracked fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   with each truck carrying one pump.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Each pump has a fluid end
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   and every fluid end utilizes consumables.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   While Q1 and 2020 on average we saw 318 active fleets
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   the exit rate in March was 240.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   where we believe 50 active fleets
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   due to the recent dynamics in the market
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   with the oversupply and lower pricing
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   for oil sinful impact on revenues within this segment.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And because of that we're taking very proactive stand
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   to drive proper cost takeout
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   to still show reasonable profitability
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   in the quarters to come.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Moving to slide 19
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of growth.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Overall the total company is down
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   approximately 20 percent in orders
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   as the month began very slow
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   particularly in U.S. and European markets
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   by the order momentum throughout April
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   we expect total revenue to be low
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   in terms of orders both industrial technology
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   and services and specialty vehicle segments
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   were right in line with the total company average.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   While precision and science technology
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   is performing considerably better
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   with positive year over year orders performance
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   thus far as a result of continuous strength
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   in medical pumps.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   And not surprisingly the high pressure solution segment
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   is down a -
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   as the market resets for what will likely be
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   a prolonged downturn
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   that we expect will last for a number of quarters.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   As we look forward due to the uncertain environment
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   that we find ourselves in
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   we will not be providing Q2
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   or total year to best manage our business
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   and ensure we're taking the right steps
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   to manage multiple scenarios
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   to stress test the balance sheet
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   and the associated impact on cash flows.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   A current model shows that the business
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   will need the diagonal basis
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   to be cash flow break even
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   using fairly conservative assumptions
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   around working capital and capital
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   coupled with the cost of actions
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   we have taken thus far.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   We feel that this puts us in a very solid position
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   moving forward when compared
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   to current order trends
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and coupled with our current liquidity position.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Experiences like 20 for some concluding remarks
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I want to say that what we
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   manage through what we will know
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   that will be a tough second quarter.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   We feel that the fundamental investment thesis
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   in the company has not changed.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Inges O'Ran is a premier industrial company
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   of our transformation.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   We have multiple levers
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   for accelerating value creation
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   but being very focused on the current
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   part of our liquidity
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   with opportunities to increase these
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   by unlocking cash
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   as well as taking advantage
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   of the current rate environment.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   We will continue to drive culture of execution
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   and we continue to pay attention to the
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   particularity on the current conditions
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   to be strategic on bolt-on acquisition.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   For this we will turn to the Q&A.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   At this time I would like to remind everyone
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   in order to ask a question
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   number one on your telephone keypad.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   If you would like to remove yourself from the queue
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   you may press the pound
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   yourself to one question
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and one answer.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Your first question comes from Andy Capilitz
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   from Citigroup.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Your line is open.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Good morning guys, how are you?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Good morning Andy, how are you?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Vicente, can you give us more color
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   into the April order declines
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   you're seeing in your largest segment
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   in ITNS? First of all,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   how long do you think the change in customer behavior
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   from that power tool business
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   now have smaller options
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   in exposure in ITNS?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   So are there discernible differences
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   in the run rate of these businesses
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   given their more project
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   versus the industrial compressor business?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Yeah Andy, let me just give you
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   a little bit of color.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I mean as you saw we said roughly
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   April total order is down 20%
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   both to build greater than one
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   from a both to build perspective
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   the industrial technology
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   and the precision and science
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   were greater than one
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   and obviously leading the way.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   I'll say in terms of ITNS in particular
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   I will categorize it as
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   the short cycle was mostly
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   most impacted in the quarter
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   and continue to see
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   some relatively weakness here
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   moving forward.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   I mean it's mostly correlated to
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   I guess maybe the PMI
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   from the down and the mainstream
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   which is what we consider to be
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   more on the loan cycle
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   I'll say comparatively a bit more
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   stable in the first quarter
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and we kind of continue to see
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   maybe some of that in the month of April.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Again typically we tend to get
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   the orders for that loan cycle
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   now in the first half of the year
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   in order to get shipments
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   in the second half
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   and from a PTO
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   from a power tool perspective
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   yeah I mean rough quarter
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   in Q1
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   as I alluded
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I mean last year they were seeing
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   some fairly good growth momentum
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   from their expansion into
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   online retailers
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   and you saw that
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   in the first quarter many of these
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   online retailers they moved
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   to having other kind of more
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   household goods or critical needs
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   to fight COVID-19
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   and clearly this business
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   saw some of the impact.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I'll say April sale is relatively slow
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   so we haven't seen
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   the people with the momentum
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   of the power tool business.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   So that's helpful Vicente
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   and I'm sure you
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   expect us to ask about
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   decremental margin in some way
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   so let me just ask it like this
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   obviously good result in Q1
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   of close to 30
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   how do I think about decrementals
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   with high pressure solutions
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   the order is down 80%
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   can you hold decrementals there
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   in the mid 40s at what point
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   has it become a problem?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I know you talked about accelerated
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   the rest of the business
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   can the rest of the business
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   hold 30% decrementals
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   in the rest of the business?
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Yeah so I'll say Andy
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   that's kind of what we're targeting for
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   and as you have seen
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   we have performed well
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   in the down cycles in the past
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I think we have a good solid playbook
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   that we executed in the 1516
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   included both not only in the industrial downturn
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   but also an upstream downturn
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   you know base decrementals
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   they tend to be around 40%
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   across the business
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   with slightly higher
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   in businesses like
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   the high pressure as you mentioned
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   as well as the precision and science
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   because of the nice high gross margins
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   that those businesses have
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   and you know lower on the specialty vehicles
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   and the industrial technologies
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   they tend to play in that kind of 40% range
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   you know you've seen
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   that we have taken very decisive actions
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   between synergies
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   and the short term actions
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   to protect the margin
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   we saw as you mentioned some very good first quarter results
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   for the total business under 30%
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   and Q2 will clearly see
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   a bit more pressure from a top line perspective
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   but we will continue to manage the decrementals
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   with the target being closer
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   to that 30%
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   of the EBITDA
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   and you know
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   when you think about the actions
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   we're clearly taking much more aggressive actions
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   and the high pressure
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   around cost actions based on what we see
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   here with a lot of our data points
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   and the long duration
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   of the downturn that we expect that business to have
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   very helpful to send
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   they stay well
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   thank you
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   your next question comes from Julian Mitchell
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   from Barclays
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   your line is open
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   hi good morning
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   morning Julian
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   maybe just a first question on that point
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   on decremental margins
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   so if you could help us understand perhaps
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   the phasing of the
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   cost synergies through the year
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   and also of that
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   40 to 50 million of other
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   cost out actions
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   and should those mean that decremental margins
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   narrow
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   or not necessarily
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   depending
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   on your mix
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   and some other things
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   maybe break it down into the two buckets
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   as Julian suggested
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   40 to 50
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   that we spoke about
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   that are kind of more related to discretionary
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   or kind of volume related
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   those are largely second quarter
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   and the third quarter
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   with a good majority I would say
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   more so on the second quarter
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   from
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   the cost synergy perspective
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   million dollars
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   the 80 to 90 million dollars
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   of in-year
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   rough account
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   and I would say that is kind of consistent
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   third quarter and fourth quarter
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   while the other roughly
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   10 to 20 million dollars that comes from procurement
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   it is really more weighted towards
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   that kind of Q3 and Q4
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   then maybe just my second question
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   for you all for Emily
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   on the free cash flow
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   you had a good performance in Q1
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   just wondered
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   assumptions around
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   break even free cash
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   but assuming
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   some play out
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   what kind of sales are down
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   20 to 25 percent for the year
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   what type of free cash flow
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   conversion
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   should we expect
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   working capital moving
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   you had I think in the free cash
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   that 63 million dollars
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   of transaction
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   and separation cash cost in Q1
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   what is the rough
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   assumption for the year
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   yes
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   we are very pleased with the Q1 cash
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   performance
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   as you saw there Julian
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   and we have been
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   managing cash
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   from
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   to put in good
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   processes and strong controls
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   around it
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   given the current crisis
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   we expect cash
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   to still be
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   to move forward but certainly
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   a longer
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   cash cycle
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   as we move through
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   and
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and we are really managing
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   you know
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   payments as
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   collections we are receiving
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   to maintain our strong cash flow
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   liquidity positions
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   you know what the future holds
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   a lot of that is going to depend
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   on
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   time for sure
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   but we know
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   we will maintain our cash position
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   in our liquidity positions
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   and how about
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   the cost
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   any very rough
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I'd posed for the year
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   in light of that 63 million
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   in Q1
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   there will be some incremental
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   I don't have the
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   figure
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   at my fingertips at the moment Julian
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   but I can get back to you on that
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   your next question
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   comes from Michael Hollaran
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   from
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Baird
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   morning everyone hope everyone is doing well
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   so could we just talk about
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   the synergy funnel you referenced
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   what are some of the incremental sources
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   that you originally
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   identified
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   maybe talk about the difference you're seeing
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   in terms of some of the revenue
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   synergy opportunities you're seeing
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   as you recall
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   we said
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   that we were going for
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   as we were 60 days
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   into
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   the transaction
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   we have all these visibility as to
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   what that funnel could potentially be
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   roughly the hundred million dollars
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   comes from a combination of structural savings
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   rationalization
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   kind of non-manufacturing
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   alluded to
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   on the investor side
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   we have now a pretty good database
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   of all the
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   locations across the world
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   and that is giving us a very good way
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   for us to really understand and rationalize
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   not so much the
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   coming year two, year three
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   but
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   more the
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   the other kind of perspective
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   so
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   second part of the question
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   liquidity is in a strong
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   position
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   you know
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   some of the one off things
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   operation
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   you know
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   some of the extra things I'm only just referenced
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   what would it take for you guys
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   to be a little bit more aggressive
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   with the cash out flow
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   second area related to that
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   that we're going into
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   some sort of recession here
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   who knows how long
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   the opportunity is going to accelerate
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   the play capital more toward the M&A
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   side of things over the next couple of years
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   and are you positioned for that
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   today and any kind of thoughts
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   and how you're thinking similarly
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   about that capital side over the next six
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   nine plus months
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   yeah, no absolutely Mike
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   I think
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   clearly over the next couple of years
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   continue to be a really
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   part of our strategy
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   you know we see
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   it's a very unique environment right now
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   we still see at this point
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   some very good funnel
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   also very good funnel
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   around
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   industrial technologies
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   but they're really more related
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   towards both ends
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   thank you
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   your next question
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   comes from Nigel Coe
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   from Wolf Research
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   your line is open
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   good morning, how are you guys
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   good afternoon
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   yeah, good thanks
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   we'll take performance
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   so a little bit
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   performance
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   performance and it seems
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   like most of that came from the legacy
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   IR businesses
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   could you maybe just
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   spell out in a bit more detail
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   how much of that can be explained
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   by the jokes
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   of the industrial
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   also what happened to service during the quarter
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Nigel, what happened to what
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   yeah, what happened to
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   our service
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   yeah
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   I think
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   China was definitely impacted largely
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   in January and February
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   the legacy IR business
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   they have a pretty sizable
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   China exposure
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   you know in terms of
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   the service
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   we saw service better
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   typically
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   we saw roughly about two times
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   from a percentage perspective
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   better performance than the original equipment
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   and just to kind of give you maybe
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   a little bit more color here
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   particularly
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   ways of comparing
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   some of the
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   industrial technologies
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   composed of multiple technologies
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   compressors, vacuums and blowers
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   and our compressor
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   business is clearly within the
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   when we specifically compare
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   to some of the first couple of data points
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   that we look at in the third party report
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   at the same time
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   you know just to give you a further
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   perspective
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   the legacy gardener Denver business
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   in Q1 orders were down in the low single
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   so in the market
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   and
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   since we didn't own
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   the legacy IR for the full quarter
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   we just tend to not comment on
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   what we saw specifically
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   in January and February that they saw
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   from an order perspective
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   but that hopefully gives you a good perspective
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   even on the legacy GD
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   great thanks
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   business
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   it's become so small now
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   so much involvement
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   but if it is down
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   8% in the quarter that implies
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   you know
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   I mean is it possible
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   to break
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   given that you're clearly expecting
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   this business to be
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   kind of like weaker for longer
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   would you expect
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   revenue to kind of like just bounce on
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   growth here
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   so for the next several quarters
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   I mean any kind of that would be helpful
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   yeah so for sure
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   that's what we're targeting to be
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   the break even even positive
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   I mean we're taking some pretty
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   pretty aggressive actions
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   100% after market and consumable
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   so that kind of carries
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   a much better margin profile
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   too as well
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   and those factories that are kind of
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   not needed
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   based on volume I mean we're basically
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   keeping them close
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   or very very low exposure
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   so a good playbook on how
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   to navigate
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   have done extensive work
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   and
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   I think we see that we can definitely
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   overcome these kind of long term
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   our plan is that
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   it's going to be down for a while
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   and to the second question
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   you know I mean clearly
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   it's a market that as you saw
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   we just invested in new fluid
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   and technology so
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   we can be ready for capturing
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   so
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   great thank you very much
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   our next question comes from Jeff Sprott
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   from
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Vertical Research Partners
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   thank you good morning everyone
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   good morning Jeff
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   why don't we just come back to service
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   for a moment to send a
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   interesting comment about
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   going down from
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   30%
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   but how do we actually interpret
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and apply that to a forward
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   sales are going to be down 30%
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   and the service I don't believe
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   I don't know if you have enough
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   data historically
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   to kind of piece that together
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   but what does that down 30% tell you
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   yeah Jeff great question
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   so in terms of historical data
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   we don't have a lot of historical
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   because as you know as you can imagine
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   both monitoring systems
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   and connectivity with the IoT platforms
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   that we both companies have now
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   is fairly new
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   but we have enough data to then
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   break it down by the specific
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   sub end market
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   the indication here
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   is that it's telling us where
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   are those markets
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   that we should continue to play
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   or double down from a service perspective
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   so it's helping us to redirect the teams
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   it is also helping us to really better
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   serve our customers
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   and making sure that we're still more resilient
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   from that perspective
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   in terms of being down 30%
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   I think we just see that
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   as a bit of indication as to
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   what could happen here
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   but as you gave us a great
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   correlation
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   we don't have a lot of historical data
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   so what we're doing
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   is just taking that data point
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   focusing them
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   on those areas
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   regions and markets
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   that we're still seeing some very good
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   utilization of the compressors
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   and any answers
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   you noted
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   IPS obviously
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   includes more than compressors
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   are you suggesting that
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   those other products areas
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   outside of vaccines and blowers
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   were substantial
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   yeah so for sure
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   for sure the
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   power tools and the lifting business
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   was one that was worse
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   than that
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   the power tools
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   they have two main product lines
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   it's that tool business
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   but also they have a lifting business
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   that is kind of more related
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   to factory consumption
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   or factory rationalization
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   so I think that was impacted
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   more so
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   and then China as a region was definitely
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   heavily impacted
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   and you know
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   from the other product lines
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   in terms of the longer cycle
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   which these are kind of brands like
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Nash, Carroll, Liquor Green Ponds
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   and Liquor Green Vacuums
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   those are more longer cycle and those were
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   I'll say more stable and resilient
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   right thank you
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   your next question comes from
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   David Rosso from Evercore ISI
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   your line is open
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   good morning
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   my question is about
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   in the ITF's inventory in the channel
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   and you think about some of the recent
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   improvement you've seen
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   can you give us some sense
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   on any sequential
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   improvement sort of a lead lag
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   and also the mix of your businesses being short cycle
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   versus long cycle
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   can you just give us some sense of the inventory
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   in those channels
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   the lag
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   that you would need to see
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   or that you would experience
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   if say the PMIs got better for example
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   yeah David
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   I think you know when we look
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   at the inventory in those channels
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   I mean there's just
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   not quite this from a compressor
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   perspective which is obviously
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   the one that has the biggest size
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   of the distribution network
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   and it is also more particularly
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   towards the Garner Denver branded products
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   you know we don't tend to have a lot of inventory
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   these are
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   particularly smaller distributors
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   more sub-regionalized
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   more localized
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   they don't tend to put a lot of cash up front
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   to have compressors on the shelf
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   so to speak I mean maybe on the smaller compressors
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   they may
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   but not on the medium to high level compressors
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   and the inventory will come
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   in more on consumables
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   aftermarket
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   really move fairly well
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   I mean they turn fairly quickly
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   you've seen just home clear
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   is it a stabilization
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   at a low level after the initial
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   shock in ITS
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   or have you seen some
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   little improvement in order sequentially
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   and I'd be curious is that more
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   short cycle or long cycle
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   yeah I know yeah great question
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   it is out categorized as the stabilization
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   and
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   initially and then obviously
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   when you look at it within the month
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   I mean at the month of April
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   there's some slight improvement
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   on the second half of April
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   but again was that more short cycle
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   improvement short cycle yeah
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   short cycle all right thank you
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   thank you very much appreciate it
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   sure
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   your next question
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   comes from Josh
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Paul Kalinsky
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   is open
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   hi good morning all
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   good morning Josh
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   so this is the day I guess
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   you know everyone here on the call
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   kind of same list of questions
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   so we covered a lot of ground already
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   but I guess
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   you know just with some of the commentary
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   around
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   utilization
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   and with the comments you made around supply chain
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   and how much of the decline
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   that you're seeing
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   and yeah I guess this comment is mostly
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   in ITS comment is related
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   to you know customer shutdowns
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   or supply chain interruption
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   and in some form like
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   you know the lights come back on
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   and a certain amount of demand comes back
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   because I think to some of these points on
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   you know service or utilization
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   that maybe that's not
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   the steady state
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   of the world there
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   yeah Josh I'll say more so
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   in China
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   if you want to think about it kind of that
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   disruption completely
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   also in the first quarter
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   maybe some disruption
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   in the perspective of
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   in Europe particularly in Italy
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   I mean we do have some very good manufacturing
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   days in Italy
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   and we although
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   we stayed operationally I mean most of our suppliers
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   had to shut down
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   I would say that
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   now as kind of the comment that I made
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   before we see kind of days lower demand level
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   kind of getting more stabilized
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   but you know
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   still you know not seeing
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   that kind of recovery
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   will play out
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   okay and then switching over to the
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   synergy funnel I mean it sounds like
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   the year three
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   you know pipeline of activity
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   you know kind of has to stay there
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   you have to act on other things first
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   and more manufacturing centric
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   fair to say that the incremental step up
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   in synergies then in the year two
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   is it's smaller
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   I guess you know is this more of a pull forward
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   year two or
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   are you kind of implicitly saying hey we think
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   there's more than 250 here we're just
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   you know we're working on this as fast as we can
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   we'll update you as we know more
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   yeah I think that's exactly the case
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   we think we want to keep it at 250
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   just because we think it's prudent
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   and we think it's prudent because we're
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   I mean clearly focused on a lot of the
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   internal funnel and execution
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   you see how we accelerate it
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   and we execute it
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   we're talking about the executed
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   but there's a component around procurement
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   and an I2V
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   saving innovative
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   value that is volume dependent
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   and when we did the 250
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   million dollar cost synergy funnel
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   it was done based on 2019
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   kind of runway level
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   so to speak of spend levels
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   so we just want to be prudent from
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   kind of going out there and saying that the 250
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   will increase you know once we're
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   ready we'll definitely and when we see
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   profitability or normalization
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   in the markets maybe we come back
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   with that but at this point in time
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   we're accelerating what we can control
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   and we know that we can control
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   that structural head count out and that's exactly
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   what we executed we know we can control
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   a lot of the quickings in procurement
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   because commodities are lower and we are executing that
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   and we know we can control a lot of discretionary
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   spend and that's exactly what we also executed
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   so we're very focused on
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   kind of going through the list of things that we can
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   really execute
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Great, appreciate the call. Good luck again.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Your next question comes from Nathan Jones
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   from Steeple. Your line is open.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   Good morning everyone.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Good morning.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   See you know revenue down
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   8.6 to XFX
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   margins up 120
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   basis points so clearly some
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   very good control lag on
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   what drove the very good
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   decrementals there
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   how you see the decrementals
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   going forward and maybe
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   any color you can give us on what you think
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   the long term margin opportunities
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   in that business.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Nathan this is
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   you know I will say
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   some very good cost control
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   but also some very good momentum
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   that we had also from the medical business
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   if you remember last year when we talked about the medical business
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   we were seeing upwards of 200
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   basis points margin improvement
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   and the medical business finishing last year
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   we had a 30-31%
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   EBITDA margin so
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   again very good momentum from that business
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   and clearly as we saw some
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   suffering in the market the team continued to execute
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   those targets that they needed
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   needed to get done.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   You know I think when you
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   look at this business that
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   has some very nice gross margins
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   and you know the decrementals
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   the base decrementals are typically
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   45 or so I mean
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   pretty good job that the team did here
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   to get the decrementals down to the 15%
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   and I'll say
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   from a long term perspective we'll definitely
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   come back with
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   giving some kind of medium to long term perspective
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   I'll just do a quick comparison and you can see
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   that medical we were able to
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   you know not only just a few years ago
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   that medical business was in the
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   25-26% EBITDA margin
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   and we finished last year
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   in the 31% EBITDA margin and there's just
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   a lot of good coming out
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   between the medical and the legacy
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   you know PFAs and ARO business
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   that are within this segment.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   Okay maybe just one on
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   receivables
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   when you look through that
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   do you see any customer credit risk
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   any collection risk there
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   I guess it's particularly an upstream comment
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   given the way
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   given the way that market's going
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   but anywhere else you see
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   any potential issues in receivables
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   how you're going about managing customer credit
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   those kinds of things
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   I mean I'll say not necessarily Nathan
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   I think it's one that we
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   live by day by day
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   I mean clearly the
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   on the high pressure solution which is
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   as you mentioned the most exposed
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   I mean customers are still paying
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   they take longer to pay but they still pay
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   you know they also realize
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   that from an upstream perspective
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   that our business is critical and essential
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   for when the market comes back up again
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   so we have been pretty strict
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   in many cases
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   that we need to see the payment
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   or we will stop shipment
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   and then we cease to provide
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   any type of
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   output of products either now
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   or later in the future so
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   I think we're
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   really executing a good label here
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   on collections with the teams
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Excellent thank you
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Thank you
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   Your next question comes from Nicole DeBles
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   from Deutsche Bank
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   Your line is open
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   Yeah thanks good morning guys
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   Good morning Nicole
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   So a lot of this has been answered
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   we've covered a lot of ground so far
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   but I just wanted to ask one
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   into next year as we think about
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   you know approaching or recovery
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   we've got you know more structural cost savings
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   coming through presumably
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   you have temporary costs
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   probably coming back to the business
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   and then just kind of delvetailing
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   all of that with typical incremental margins
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   I'm not sure how best
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   you can do this Vicente but it would be really
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   helpful to kind of characterize
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   the way you see incrementals
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   coming out you know on the other side
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   of this downturn
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   Yeah Nicole yeah that's great
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   I mean I think we typically see
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   kind of the base
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   what I call the base level
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   of incremental to be
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   for the total business
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   between 35 to 40 percent
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   again you know when you look at
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   specialty vehicles
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   lower than that with maybe industrial
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   technologies about that level
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   you know definitely
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   we'll see a little bit of a headwind
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   as we see a lot of these
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   structural activities that we're doing
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   to come to the fruition
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   we also see a lot of
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   you know tailwinds
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   I'm sorry we see tailwinds that a lot of these
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   kind of structural costs come out
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   we see some of the headwinds
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   but you know as we kind of get
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   closer to coming out here
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   to our budgets and how we kind of
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   work with the teams we'll definitely
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   find ways on how we can continue
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   get that incremental margin
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   obviously to be
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   at a minimum of that base or more
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   Your next question comes from
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   John Walsh from Credit Suisse
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   Your line is open
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   Sorry, your next question
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   is from Marcus
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   Nitmeyer from UBS
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   Your line is open
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   Yeah hi good morning everybody
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   I just want to one more on the
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   hi good morning
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   on synergies
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   I do appreciate that obviously
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   procurement is volume dependent
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   but you flag here
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   10 to 20 million savings
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   realized in 2020
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   what do you currently assume
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   is the one rate savings out of that
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   with one of the spend which I think
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   is a third of your overall spend
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   and how should we think about more
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   medium term for the other two thirds
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   if you assume that a time point
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   in a normalized word gets back to
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   about 2019 levels
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   let's start here
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   Yeah I think if you think about it
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   10 to 20 coming in
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   in this year
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   as you go into 2021
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   assuming maybe kind of current volume levels
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   20 million
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   so that's maybe at least
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   what you can see here coming from wave 1
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   on an analyzed level
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   at current volumes
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   and that is only
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   covering a portion of the total spend
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   with waves 2 and wave 3
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   coming up here
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   in the second half of the year
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   Right and is there sort of an estimate
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   you can give us what that would have been
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   at 19 volume levels
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   that sort of 20 to 40
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   I mean it would definitely be
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   a little bit higher than that
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   I mean
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   I wouldn't
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   I think at this point in time
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   you could say 40 to 50 could be
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   upwards of 60
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Okay
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   and then second question
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   on capital allocation
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   you flagged in the slides with interesting
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   sort of bolt downs in PST
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   it's obviously pretty fragmented
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   market you probably have a share of
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   in that space
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   how do you think
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   about this? How does that segment look like
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   in a few years? I mean it's
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   from an aftermarket perspective
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   I know it's a design win and replacement business
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   so the aftermarket dollars per se
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   or share is relatively small compared
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   to company average
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   but how do you think about this
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   it just struck me that it was flagged
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   specifically in the slides
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   Yeah I mean I think this is a segment
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   we like a lot by the way
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   that these businesses are
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   so niche
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   and very solid
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   market positions
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   and it has just a lot of great
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   descriptors such as
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   high gross margins
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   and very specialized
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   pumps that are kind of really
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   solidly mission critical
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   in the processes where they
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   apply
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   we continue to see
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   there's a lot of potential not only in organic
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   but also organically
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   and we're doing a lot of work on that
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   whether you take technologies like
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   the ARO
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   and combine that with
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   either a Haskell branded product
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   or a Milton Roy product
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   and then you can actually create some uniqueness
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   in terms of applications
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   and then enter some new markets
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   and that's what a lot of the team are doing
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   how do we
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   are being thoughtful and mindful
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   on some of those vertical markets
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   that would niche adjacent areas
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   that we want to play in
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   and not only do that organically
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   but then see what other technologies
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   from a Bolton perspective we can acquire
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   so a lot of really great work
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   strategically going on in this segment
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   to really picture this
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   and how do we kind of double it
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   Thanks a lot, good luck
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   Thank you
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   Your next question comes from John Walsh
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   from Credit Suisse
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Hi
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   Good morning
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   Sorry about that
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   I had some technical difficulties earlier
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   I'm glad to hear everyone's doing well
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   Maybe just one question here
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   You alluded on the call
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   to share gains on
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   kind of both the legacy GDI
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   and IR businesses
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   I wanted to know if you could put
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   a little more color around what's driving those
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   Is it something on
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   the product side?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   Some of the end market strategies
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   you were doing previously around
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   more niche markets
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   like paper and pulp
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   Maybe some competitive
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   pressures from smaller
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   guys, just any kind of color
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   you could provide there would be helpful
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   Sure, John.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   What I said on the call
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   is that it is on specific horsepower
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   and what we saw that we liked
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   is that this is in the U.S.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   based on the third party report
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   and we liked it because
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   it was very complimentary
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   If you look at the legacy Garnet Denver
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   we saw some share takes
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   in the low to medium horsepower
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   while we saw on the Ingersoll Run
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   some share take on the high
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   larger horsepower compressors
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   I will categorize that as
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   Ingersoll Run has done a pretty good job
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   on launching some new technology
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   on the larger horsepower
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   From a Garnet Denver perspective
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   we have been more focused on
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   and I think this is
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   what I mentioned on the call
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   that this is a great hypothesis that we had
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   on this great merge
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   and combining the two companies
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   because now we have great new
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   complimentary products and spectrum
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   of technologies
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   that I mentioned is on the oil lubricated
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   which is very good
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   solid kind of core product line
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   but as we spoke about during
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   the April call
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   now also the oil free product line
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   so again it is
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   new technology, new products
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   and be able to show
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   that uniqueness of differentiation
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   on the products of the teams at luncheon
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   Great, appreciate taking the question
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   Thank you John
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   There are no further questions at this time
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   I turn the call back over to the company
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   Thank you, I just want to close out by saying
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   thanks to everyone for your interest
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   in Ingersoll Run
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   I just want to do another shootout
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   and thank you to our employees
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   that are always doing a lot of work here
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   to stay health
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   stay safe to safety
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   and at the same time
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   provide to our customers the mission critical products
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   that are needed
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   in this kind of current market conditions
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   so hopefully everyone stays safe
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   and healthy and we will look forward
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   to talking to you over the next few weeks
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   Thank you
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.560]   Thank you for participating.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.960]   You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Constellion's second quarter
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.320]   2020 Results Call.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.520]   At this time, all participants are in a lease and only mode.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.200]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   time.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.480]   If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.320]   touchstone telephone.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.920]   As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.640]   I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Ryan Bentley, Director
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640]   of Investor Relations.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640]   Sir, please go ahead.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640]   Thank you, Operator.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.000]   I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2020 earnings call.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.120]   On the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Jean-Marc Germain, and our Chief Financial
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.000]   Officer, Peter Mat.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.560]   After the presentation, we will have a Q&A session.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.720]   A copy of the slide presentation for today's call is available on our website at constellium.com
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.640]   and today's call is being recorded.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.240]   Before we begin, I would like to encourage everyone to visit the company's website and
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.440]   take a look at our recent filings.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.800]   Today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Security
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.720]   Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.520]   Such statements include statements regarding the company's anticipated financial and operating
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.120]   performance, future events and expectations, and may involve known and unknown risks and
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120]   uncertainties.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.880]   For a summary of specific risk factors that could cause results differ materially from
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.680]   those expressed in the forward-looking statement, please refer to the factors presented under
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.440]   the heading Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 20F.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.120]   All information in this presentation is as of the date of the presentation.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.280]   We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.080]   of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.000]   In addition, today's presentation includes information regarding certain non-gap financial
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   measures.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.800]   Please see the reconciliations of non-gap financial measures attached in today's slide presentation
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.640]   would supplement our IFRS disclosures.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.540]   I would now like to hand the call over to Jean-Marc.
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.540]   Thanks, Ryan.
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.540]   Good morning.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.540]   Good afternoon, everyone.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.560]   And thank you for your interest in Constellion.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.520]   Let's turn to slide 5.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.920]   At Constellion, the health and safety of our employees is our first priority.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.000]   We have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.920]   We have provided our personnel with personal protective equipment, increased cleaning
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.760]   and sanitation, allowed for and enforced social distancing, and worked to raise awareness
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   with our employees.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.280]   I want to personally thank our employees for taking this seriously and following the precautions
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.600]   we have put into place.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.240]   As of last Friday, approximately one-half of 1% of our employees have tested positive
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   for COVID-19, and all of whom have recovered or are recovering.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.920]   Needless to say, we must remain vigilant.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.120]   During the second quarter, our plans operated well, despite the significant disruptions
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.160]   to customer demand from lockdowns in both Europe and the US.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.920]   As I'm speaking, all our plans are running now and well.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.960]   We are carefully monitoring COVID-19 hotspots, both for the health of our employees and any
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.600]   potential impacts on supply chains.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.640]   The demand for our products gradually increased during the course of the second quarter, and
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.600]   this trend has continued into July.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.040]   However, both levels of demand and visibility from our customers remain below historical
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.400]   level.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.120]   We took strong actions to combat the effects of the pandemic on our business.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.640]   We aggressively reduced our costs, including flexing variable costs to match production
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   levels, reducing fixed costs, and lowering our targeted capital expenditures.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.320]   Over 40% of our workforce were on subtype of partial unemployment or temporary lay-off
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.080]   scheme during the quarter.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.920]   Where appropriate, we have also implemented permanent headcount reduction.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.600]   Our ability to flex costs was slightly better than the scenario we provided last quarter.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.880]   This was a great achievement by the entire Considium team and demonstrated our flexibility
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.920]   and resilience.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.560]   Our liquidity at the end of the quarter was 949 million euros, an increase of over 300
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.840]   million euros compared to the end of the first quarter.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.560]   We added an additional 50 million euros of liquidity in July through credit facilities
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.120]   supported by the German state, bringing our pro forma liquidity to approximately 1 billion
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.120]   euros.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.480]   In June, we accessed the debt markets to refinance our 2021 bonds.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.280]   This transaction removed our only near-term bond maturity at the very attractive coupon.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.280]   In conclusion, with the significant actions we have taken, I am very confident in our
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.720]   ability to navigate through this crisis.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.360]   On slide 6, you will see some of our highlights from the second quarter of 2020.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.440]   Shipments were 310,000 metric tons, a decrease of 25% compared to the second quarter of 2020.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.760]   Revenue decreased 33% to 1 billion euros.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.880]   Of the roughly 500 million euro decline in revenue compared to the second quarter of last
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.840]   year, two-thirds was related to lower shipments and one-third was related to lower metal prices.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.920]   I remind you that while our revenues are affected by changes in metal prices, we operate a
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.560]   pass-through business model to minimize metal risk.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.440]   Net loss of 32 million euros compared to net income of 17 million euros in the second
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.000]   quarter of 2019.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.520]   Adjusted EBITDA of 81 million euros decreased 51% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.160]   With a strong focus on cost control, we are able to offset a significant part of the volume
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.720]   and wind to adjust EBITDA across each of our business units.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.920]   I am proud of what the team was able to achieve in a challenging environment.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.200]   Custodium generated 228 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first half, a decline of 24%
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.240]   compared to the first six months of last year.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.840]   Our free cash flow was negative 33 million euros in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.520]   This result would not have been possible without our strong actions to reduce costs and capital
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.000]   expenditures and cash expenditures of all sorts.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.680]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was 54 million euros.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.600]   Based on our current view of market conditions, we expect to generate positive free cash flow
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   in 2020.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.280]   I will now hand over to Peter to discuss our financial performance in more detail.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   Peter?
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.480]   Thank you Jean-Marc and thank you everyone for joining the call today.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.280]   Turning now to slide 8, you will find the change in adjusted EBITDA by segment for the
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.680]   second quarter in the first half of 2020 compared to the same periods of last year.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.840]   For the second quarter of 2020, Custodium achieved 81 million euros of adjusted EBITDA,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.760]   a decrease of 86 million euros or 51% year over year.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:55.200]   First adjusted EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased by 21 million euros or 27% compared
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.760]   to last year.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:05.400]   ANT adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased by 33 million euros or 51% compared to the
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.760]   second quarter of 2019.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:15.240]   AS&I adjusted EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31 million euros compared
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   to last year.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.880]   Currently holdings and corporate costs of 7 million euros were 1 million euros higher
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.120]   than last year.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:32.840]   In the first 6 months of 2020, Custodium achieved 228 million euros of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.920]   of 74 million euros or 24% year over year.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:45.480]   Part adjusted EBITDA of 124 million euros decreased by 14 million euros or 11% compared
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.520]   to last year.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:56.680]   ANT adjusted EBITDA of 83 million euros decreased by 33 million euros or 28% compared to the
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.400]   first 6 months of 2019.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:08.800]   AS&I adjusted EBITDA of 33 million euros decreased by 26 million euros or 44% compared to last
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   year.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   Lastly, holdings and corporate costs of 12 million euros were 1 million euros higher
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.320]   than last year.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:23.640]   We expect agency costs of approximately 20 million euros in 2020.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.200]   Now turn to slide 9 and let's focus on the PARP segment.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.880]   Adjusted EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased 27% compared to the second quarter of last
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   year.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.920]   Volume was a headwind of 41 million euros in the quarter.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.400]   Packaging shipments fell by 12% primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in March
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.320]   of our Nusperzach plant in France due to COVID-19.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:59.600]   Shipments to the North American canned sheet market increased slightly year over year.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.000]   Automotive shipments declined 54% compared to last year as many of our automotive OEM
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.800]   customers curtailed production for April and most of May.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.080]   Price and mix was a headwind of 2 million euros.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.600]   Costs were a tailwind of 21 million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.320]   labor and maintenance as important contributors.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.640]   Metal costs were neutral in the quarter as we faced difficult year over year comps, UBC
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.200]   supply chain challenges and lower metal prices.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.680]   FX translation was a tailwind of 1 million euros.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.240]   Now turn to slide 10 and let's focus on the ANT segment.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.960]   Adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased by 51% compared to last year.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:01.480]   Volume was a headwind of 46 million euros on lower aerospace and TID shipments.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:09.280]   Aerospace shipments fell 37% compared to last year as aerospace OEM and distributors began
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.720]   to reduce orders.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:19.400]   TID shipments declined by 20% due to lower industrial activity in both Europe and the
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   US.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.920]   Price and mix was a 3 million euro headwind due to lower aerospace shipments.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:34.000]   Costs were a tailwind of 15 million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   labor, metal, and maintenance as important contributors.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.200]   Lastly, FX translation was a 1 million euro tailwind in the quarter.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.080]   Now turn to slide 11 and let's focus on the AS&I segment.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.760]   EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31 million euros compared to the second
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.640]   quarter of 2019.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.000]   Volume was a 31 million euro headwind.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.800]   Automotive shipments declined 52% compared to last year due to customer shutdowns for
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.120]   a significant portion of the quarter.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.600]   Industry shipments declined 16% due to lower industrial activity in Europe.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.960]   Price and mix was a 9 million euro headwind partially due to price and mix as a consequence
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.080]   of weaker market conditions.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:36.080]   Costs were a 9 million euro tailwind on strong cost control with labor, energy, and fixed
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.600]   cost as important contributors.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.800]   Lastly, FX translation was a 1 million euro headwind in the quarter.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:51.560]   Now turning to slide 12, I want to highlight our very strong cost performance during the
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.280]   second quarter.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.520]   In the second quarter, we managed to flex our cost by 83%.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.880]   Cost flex represents the change of cost over the change of revenues for the second quarter
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.080]   of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:16.440]   Effectively, for every dollar change in revenue, we were able to flex our cost by 83 cents.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:23.160]   This compares favorably to the 75% variable cost estimate we provided last quarter.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.280]   At the bottom of the page, you can see that each of our businesses demonstrated strong
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:37.320]   cost control with PARP at 92% cost flex and ANT and AS&I at 75%.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:44.160]   To put this in context, excluding metal and depreciation, we reduced cost by approximately
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.760]   100 million euros compared to the second quarter of last year.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:56.160]   These cost savings were driven by strong cost control across the businesses including labor,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.120]   maintenance, professional fees, subcontractors, and energy.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:08.300]   I will note that our second quarter 2020 figures include approximately a 15 million euro benefit
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:14.440]   from European state employment aid related to COVID-19.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.520]   I want to congratulate the team for the aggressive actions taken on cost.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   We will continue to maintain our strong focus on cost control, particularly given the uncertain
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.080]   demand environment.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.060]   Now let's turn to slide 13 and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:40.880]   At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was 4.4 times and our net debt was 2.2 billion
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:46.480]   euros, slightly lower than our net debt position at the end of 2019.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.960]   We remain very committed to capital discipline.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:58.320]   We reduced our 2020 CapEx target to approximately 175 million euros, a 96 million euro reduction
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   from 2019.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.720]   Through the first half of 2020, we spent 32 million euros less in CapEx than in the same
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.240]   period of last year.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.840]   Our free cash flow for the second quarter was negative 33 million euros.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.800]   During the quarter, as a consequence of lower activity, our factored receivables were lower
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:25.200]   than the levels that we have maintained in recent quarters and negatively impacted our
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.280]   free cash flow by 73 million euros.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.880]   We would expect the reverse to occur as activity levels increase.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.320]   Excluding the impact of factoring, the company actually generated positive free cash flow
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.880]   in the second quarter, which is a very impressive outcome in my view.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.360]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was 54 million euros.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:58.240]   As John Mark noted earlier, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 based on our
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.200]   current view of market conditions.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.800]   Generating free cash flow is a firm priority and we remain committed to deleveraging.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.640]   As you can see in our debt summary on the bottom left-hand side of the page, we have
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.800]   no bond maturities until 2024.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:22.600]   During the quarter, we refinanced the remaining 200 million of our 4 and 5/8 percent notes
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:33.400]   due to 2021 with $325 million of 5 and 5/8 percent notes due to 2028.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.720]   While we initially planned to repay the 21 with free cash flow, we felt it was prudent
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.880]   to remove this near-term maturity given the favorable debt market conditions.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:51.960]   Notably, this was the lowest coupon dollar bomb that Consilium has ever priced, a considerable
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.840]   achievement in the midst of a pandemic.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.640]   As a result of our financing activities thus far in 2020, we now expect cash interest of
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   150 to 160 million euros.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.840]   Our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was 949 million euros
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.880]   at the end of the second quarter.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:20.280]   As John Mark noted, we added 50 million euros to this balance in July and we remain very
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.800]   comfortable in our liquidity position.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.360]   I will now hand the call back to John Mark.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   Thank you Peter.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.880]   Let's turn to site 15.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   I want to highlight something that is core to our business, sustainability.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:40.100]   In early July, we published our 2019 Business and Sustainability Report which you can find
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.600]   on our website.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.060]   I'd like to point out a few highlights from 2019.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.160]   Safety is our first priority.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.280]   Our target is to reduce our recordable case rates by 10% year after year.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:01.680]   Between 2016 and 2019, our recordable case rate decreased by 27% and we are trending
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.320]   very well this year.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:09.760]   This means that more of our colleagues are returning home injury-free every day.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:17.240]   We also improved our energy efficiency by 6.4% compared to a 2015 baseline.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:23.480]   That is the equivalent of 100,000 metric tons of CO2 savings every year.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:32.040]   Further, we introduced the 2025 target to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 25%
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.560]   against the 2015 baseline.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.220]   We have a detailed plan to achieve this target.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:45.680]   As many of you know, recycling is a core competency at Constellium.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:52.280]   Aluminum is infinitely recyclable with 75% of all aluminum ever produced still in use
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   today.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.080]   Muscle Sholes is one of the largest recyclers of aluminum cans globally with the capacity
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:04.000]   to recycle over 20 billion cans every year.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.600]   At Novprezak, we also recycle the equivalent of 12 billion beverage cans every year.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:18.560]   As a company, Constellium recycled over 560,000 metric tons of externally sourced aluminum
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.800]   scrap in 2019.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.160]   I am also proud that third parties are recognizing Constellium for our sustainability achievements.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.840]   The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, or ASI, is an industry-led initiative to drive
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:40.400]   sustainability across the entire aluminum value chain from producers to customers.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:48.160]   In 2019, we received ASI certifications for Zingen's casting and rolling operations,
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.960]   and we began producing ASI-certified coils for our customers from Zingen in 2020.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:01.820]   We also received ASI certification of our Novprezak facility under provisional COVID conditions
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.000]   in 2020.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.040]   We achieved the EcoVadis Platinum rating, which is awarded to the top 1% of companies
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:19.560]   assessed worldwide, and we received an ESG rating of AA from MSCI, placing us in the top
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.560]   5% of our sector.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:27.560]   Overall, we had a very successful year on our sustainability objectives in 2019, and
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:34.320]   I look forward to continuing our progress on these very important initiatives.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.840]   Now let's turn to slide 16 and discuss our end markets.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.920]   We believe our balanced portfolio of products across end markets, geographies, and customers
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.680]   is a competitive advantage during challenging times like these.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.400]   I'll start with the packaging markets.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.640]   Packaging is a core market for constellation, and we presented 38% of our LTM revenue.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:05.080]   We continue to see strong demand in North America and stable demand in Europe.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:11.920]   Further evidence that this market is both recession resilient and secular growth.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.840]   We believe the packaging market has long term secular growth tailwinds driven by customer
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.440]   preference for aluminum cans.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.400]   Our customers continue to invest in new can lines with several additional investments
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.160]   in North America just announced in the last week.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:35.560]   These additional lines should drive incremental demand for canned sheets in the years to come.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:41.440]   The consumer preference trend is only one of tailwinds for canned sheet.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.840]   In Europe, the demand for canned sheet continues to grow based on substitution of aluminum
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.840]   for steel.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:54.640]   In the US, we continue to expect the growth of auto body sheet demand to tighten supply
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:00.480]   to the packaging market over the medium to long term.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.920]   Now let's move to automotive.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.200]   Over the long term, automotive remains a secular growth market for aluminum.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.760]   Customers continue to prefer larger vehicles.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.400]   With regulations aimed at increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions, the automotive
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.880]   market will need to continue to lightweight.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.280]   In addition, we expect hybrid and electric vehicles to continue to gain share of the
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.280]   fleet.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.640]   These vehicles are aluminum intensive due to the importance of lightweighting to achieve
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.440]   their range objectives.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.800]   Constellium is well positioned to realize the benefits of this secular shift to aluminum
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.040]   in automotive and the electrification of the fleet.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:48.760]   According to more recent trends, automotive OEMs began curtailing production in March
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.000]   and largely resumed production in May.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.160]   While demand from our customers increased significantly in June, we have experienced uneven demand
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:06.040]   for our products as a result of supply chain challenges and COVID-19 hotspots.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:11.560]   While we are optimistic about automotive demand in the back half of 2020, the demand for our
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.280]   products will be dependent on the level of production at the OEM.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.080]   Let's turn now to aerospace.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.640]   Aerospace represented 15% of our LTM revenues.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:30.400]   The near-term outlook for aerospace remains uncertain due to the effects from COVID-19
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.360]   and the 737 MAX.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.600]   Aerospace OEMs have reduced build rates and it is unclear how long build rates will remain
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.480]   at these levels.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.760]   We expect aerospace shipments in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 will be lower than
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.800]   the level in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:56.760]   In TID, we expect to continue to expand in niche products in a diversified range of markets
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.480]   over the long term.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:05.040]   In the near term, the defense and rail markets remain strong, but most industrial and transportation
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.440]   markets remain weak.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.240]   These markets are dependent upon the health of the industrial economy in Europe and North
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   America.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:19.000]   It is unclear when and to what extent these markets will rebound.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.920]   In closing, I again want to thank the Constellium team for their tireless efforts during this
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.920]   trying time.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:32.480]   We remain committed to operational execution, harvesting the benefits of our investments,
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.760]   discipline capital deployment, debt reduction, and shareholder value creation.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.560]   With that, Joanna, we will now open the Q&A session.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.680]   Thank you, sir.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:49.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press far than the number
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.800]   one on your touchtone telephone.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.480]   If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   press the pal key.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:08.640]   Your first question comes from the line of Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   Your line is open.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:30.240]   Chris, if you are on mute, please unmute.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.040]   Chris, your line is not open.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.360]   How's your market, Peter?
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   Can you hear me?
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   Yeah, we can.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.360]   Good morning, Chris.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   Good morning.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.720]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.440]   The first thing I wanted to start with was just the utilisation rates and the comments
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.440]   from 1Q.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:56.160]   You sort of stepped through how you saw utilisation in each of the divisions for 2Q and then perhaps
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.360]   for 3Q and 4Q.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.240]   I appreciate you don't have guidance, but I wondered whether you could maybe concessually
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:09.640]   talk through 3Q versus 4Q versus 2Q or any comments you could make on the divisions as
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.640]   an update from last quarter.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   Thanks.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   Sure, Chris.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.280]   I'll start with the markets and then translate it into what it can mean for the divisions
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.040]   or the business units.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.160]   When you look at our second quarter of this year versus the second quarter of last year,
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:36.680]   you see packaging roughly 10% down, you see automotive 50% down, you see aerospace 40%
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   down, roughly.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.480]   And the other markets and each market is about 25% down.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.320]   This is made of very different dynamics.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:50.860]   In packaging, what we are seeing now is 95% utilisation.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:56.840]   There was a bit of a drop, especially in April with all the lockdowns in Europe, reduction
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.680]   in canned consumption and all that, but that has come back pretty strong and the US continues
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.440]   to be quite strong.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.320]   So we look at packaging, again, recession resilience, secular growth, and we're pretty
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:16.200]   confident for the second half of the year and we look at Q2 as being kind of an abnormal
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.560]   quarter because of all that happened in April and a little bit in May.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.640]   If I look at automotive, it has really snapped back.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.800]   I think when we talked on Q1, we're talking of 20% utilisation, as we were speaking, and
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.320]   now we're at above 80%, right?
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:38.360]   If you do the average of 20 and 80, you get to 50, which is about what we experienced
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:47.160]   in the second half, in terms of reduction in their shipments.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.480]   It seems like it can be stronger than 80% going forward.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.980]   We certainly are running very well in July, but we've seen that this restart has been
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.800]   with all kinds of fits and stops, right?
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:05.320]   So you've got upspots, you've got supply chain disruptions, you've got difficulties in bringing
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:12.360]   products from Mexico, building trucks in Texas is challenging, so you've got all those operational
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.280]   issues that all of us in the supply chain have to deal with.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:24.000]   But clearly the demand seems to be well in excess of 80% of where we were last year.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.920]   So that's encouraging and hopefully COVID-19 doesn't throw too much of a wrench in that
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   good thread.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.880]   If I look now at aerospace, where we are running at around 60% in the quarter, we expect more
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.680]   pain in the second half of the year.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:50.000]   I think the reason for that is it's a long supply chain, and the customers move a little
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.560]   bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their orders.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:01.220]   And that is creating a bit of a lag in terms of how much pain we take.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:06.240]   We are in very detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.200]   to look at what the second half ought to look like.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.440]   And whilst contractually, we could force some volumes on us, that's not our type.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.760]   What they don't need, we don't want to force on them.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   So what we're working through is taking more pain now in the second half, so that 2021
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.520]   we start with a clean slate.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:32.240]   So we would expect some reduction in operating rates in aerospace in the second half of the
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   year.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:39.160]   So if you translate all that into what it means for the different BU's, I would expect
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.760]   BOP, Packaging and Automotive, to be better.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:50.680]   I would expect ASNI, Automotive Structures essentially, to be better in the second half,
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.440]   and I would expect ENT to be more challenged in the second half.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:09.560]   I would just follow up on packaging specifically, where the volumes are down at around about
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:15.000]   10%, I think year on year, and you're saying Muscle Shoals is doing well, it seems like
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.200]   the US is going well.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   I think Crown yesterday mentioned that Southern Europe was weak, can you just comment a little
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:28.640]   bit further about packaging in the EU region, was it down in the quarter because of demand
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:34.880]   or because you had facilities offline and maybe you could quantify some of the EU impacts?
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.440]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:42.000]   The reason I'm saying more than 90% or 95% whatever, that's 100%, it's exactly because
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.360]   of some weakness in Europe.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:52.520]   I think it's got to do with the reduction in activity in Southern Europe, I mean a lot
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:58.600]   of these countries have economies that are based on tourism, and this is not the best
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:04.960]   year for tourism as we all know, and we are seeing there's little clusters and hotspots
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.640]   so everybody's a bit vigilant as it should be, so that is weighing down a little bit
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.720]   on canton summation in Europe, yes.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:29.120]   Okay, and just, sorry I had one follow up on working capital specifically, I just wanted
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:35.160]   maybe Peter if you could talk through the two queue moving parts, obviously you stepped
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.160]   through those waterfall charts and you're getting cost out, doing a great job on the
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   cost side.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.840]   I just wanted if you come in a little bit further on the second half of the year, and
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:52.360]   what the opportunities are on working capital in terms of you saying positive for the full
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:57.480]   year, you've already obviously hit the positive number at the halfway point, so just wanted
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.680]   if you could talk through the moving parts on working capital.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:06.320]   Sure, happy to do it, and just for context, so on the second quarter as we said last quarter
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:15.000]   we would use working capital, and we in fact burned 63 million of working capital in Q2,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.520]   and for the first half were positive 24, so based on where we sit today I think it's plausible
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:30.560]   to think that with auto ramping, with packaging kind of continuing to ramp back up that we
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:36.120]   could lose some ground in the back half of the year, so not a huge negative, but we could
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.880]   see working capital being a use in the back half of the year.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:47.720]   But Chris I would say that we remain confident in spite of that, that we can achieve a free
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.600]   cash flow position.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:59.320]   Thanks Veda, that's it from me, thank you.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:07.640]   Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the Benchmark Company, your
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.640]   line is open.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.640]   Good morning Josh.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:16.120]   Just a question, how are you thinking of any tariffs on Canadian aluminum, have you increased
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.960]   any inventory expecting that, or just what should we be thinking on that front if that
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.840]   comes to fruition?
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:30.120]   Well, I mean we believe it's a misguided measure if it happens, right, we've lobbed it against
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:35.680]   it in the past, we've got it removed, it may come back, we think it's misguided and it
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.880]   doesn't address the problem which is overcapacity from China, from a non-market economy that
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.320]   doesn't play by the same rules as we do.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:50.400]   Now that said, if it happens it's got a very limited impact on us, so I remind you that
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:58.120]   we pass through the melt cost essentially to most of our customers, there may be a little
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:03.720]   section of the business where we cannot reprise immediately when it happens, but on the other
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:09.320]   side we may gain a little bit more on scrap recycling as well, so not much of an impact
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   for us.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.600]   The reason we're against it is much more a matter of principle because we believe in
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:22.480]   free and failed trade and really a problem for our finances or our economy outcome.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.080]   Got it.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:31.480]   And then just on the canned sheet front, can you remind us of when your larger contracts
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.840]   are up for renegotiation and then just any comment around pricing strength?
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:44.320]   So we don't go into the detail of exactly which contracts mature when, but you know
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.880]   that we've got a few renewals coming around the 22 horizon.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:57.000]   We are making good progress and I think the pricing environment is, I would describe it
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.760]   as a mildly positive in the US and mildly negative in Europe because of the specific situation
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   now.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:10.840]   I remind you that contractual negotiations take a lot of time here and whilst we, you
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.920]   know, I say it's mildly positive here and mildly negative there between now and whenever
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:23.920]   we actually ink a contract, things may change, but I think it's a pretty benign environment.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:30.560]   And our product is in demand, I'll brag a little bit, our quality and our service is
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.800]   very much recognized.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:38.880]   Mr. Schultz has done a terrific job over the past five years and he's a very strong player
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:45.040]   in the market now, very recognized, very quality service wise, and therefore he's always been.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.840]   So we have strong positions and I'm looking at the future with a great deal of confidence.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   Great.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.840]   Thank you.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   Thanks Josh.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:02.680]   Your next question comes from the line of David Dragliano from BMO Capital Markets.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   Your line is open.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.680]   Great.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   Thanks for taking my questions.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.400]   First of all, I did have one question on the numbers for the second quarter.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.720]   Did you say there was a $15 million one-time benefit included in the $81 million adjusted
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   EBITDA line?
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:22.320]   You're talking about for the labor benefit?
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.200]   I thought it was a COVID-19 state aid benefit, is that included in the $81 million?
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.240]   Yeah, that's included in adjusted EBITDA.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:35.800]   But it's not a one-off and it continues, those programs are what it's referred to as CURPS
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:41.240]   Arbyte or Schumacher-Parsier or short-time work, and these government programs continue
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.920]   through 2020 and in some cases in 2021.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:50.000]   Okay, so we should assume about a $15 million quarterly benefit from those programs each
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   quarter?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.840]   No, because what will happen, David, is remember, so in the second quarter we had a lot of people
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.800]   on the sidelines, right, but as we ramp up, then we're going to have substantially less
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   of that.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:09.520]   So I think you should assume that in the businesses, so packaging, for example, where we had some
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:17.920]   benefit in Q2, we should have basically very limited, if any, benefit in Q3.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:23.800]   And automotive, which has fade away and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.280]   innovation rate there, but it'll be a much lower number.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:34.400]   To give you an indication, we mentioned about people being unemployed during the quarter.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:41.440]   At the trough, which is behind us, we had 6,000 people under some kind of an employment benefit
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.600]   or temporary layoff.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.160]   Now we're at less than 2,000, so it's closed dramatically.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:55.800]   Yeah, and David, just to put it in perspective, if you get to the fourth quarter, the number
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:02.360]   might be something like 25% of that, right, just based on the utilization rate, just rough
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   number.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.160]   Okay, that's actually helpful.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   Thank you.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:13.920]   And then just in terms of the individual and market commentary, on the aerospace side, obviously
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:23.720]   that's the, or has been the highest margin business, and just in terms of the outlet commentary,
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:29.280]   you framed obviously two segments up, one segment down, but the down segment is again
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   the highest margin segment.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.480]   I didn't really get a census to order magnitude of the down number versus the up numbers.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.920]   Can you just give us a census, do you believe that aerospace will completely offset the
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:47.640]   recovery in auto and packaging in the second half, or a bit more, you know, order of magnitude
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.720]   on the decline in aerospace would be helpful?
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:56.200]   So it's very difficult to tell David, because we're, as we speak, in very active discussions
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.920]   with our customers, and at the end of the day, it's so cool that we have to make it jointly
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.920]   with them.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:07.960]   As I mentioned, we've got contracts whereby we can force them to take some product, which
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.640]   they will take and pay for all, but then they don't need it the following year, right?
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.840]   So they hold the, they hold the inventory, they are holding the bags.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:20.200]   So we are looking collaboratively with them in terms of what is it exactly they need,
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.880]   which by the way, I don't think they fully know now, and it's no criticism of them.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.520]   I mean, it's very unusual time.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.920]   And once we know what they need and we look at what cuts do we take, then I could answer
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.160]   your question possibly.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:42.840]   At this stage I cannot, I would just say that there will be for sure more pain in auto structures
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.600]   and then the auto structures in aerospace, my apologies, aerospace.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.280]   Now the other thing too is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:40:00.280]   in the recent past, the second half is always weaker than the first half, right, in aerospace.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.120]   So that's something to factor in as well.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.120]   Okay.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:12.360]   And just my last related question is, I think you mentioned, I think average utilization
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:19.000]   rates for aerospace related demand in the second quarter was around 60% at your facilities,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   is that right?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   What is that number now?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:31.840]   We're running still around that number, but I would expect it to go down maybe to 50%
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.200]   that kind of range.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   Okay.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   All right.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   That's helpful.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   Thanks very much.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   Okay.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:45.400]   So it's, it's important to say we're not expecting it to go down to 30% right to you, but that's
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.560]   not, not on the horizon.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:57.000]   Speaker, your next question comes from the line of Kurt Woodward from Credit Suisse.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.480]   Your line is open.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.480]   Hi.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.480]   Good morning.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.480]   Thank you.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.360]   Peter, first question on the 100 million euro cost reductions.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.480]   How much of that would you view as structural and then, you know, I guess just in general
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.360]   in terms of the amount of cost you think you could take out of the business this year on
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.360]   a permanent basis?
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:25.200]   Can you give us an update on, on those efforts?
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:31.880]   So if we look, if we look at the, I mean, so the biggest piece of that 100 million is
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.240]   related to labor, right?
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:40.560]   So and that's probably labor is probably, you know, half of that 100 million.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:48.200]   So what we're doing now is we are really closely looking at the business and, you know, what
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.720]   it's likely to be like for the next couple of years.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:56.200]   And then, you know, trying to size our labor forces according to that.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:02.480]   So in that regard, I think we would expect that there's going to be some kind of permanent
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.480]   savings.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:11.680]   But remember, as we kind of ramp up the operations, we do expect some of that cost is going to
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.680]   come back.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.680]   Right?
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:19.840]   So, you know, I'd say it's hard to give a really precise number on that, Kurt.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.680]   If it's a difficult one.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   Okay.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:29.560]   Kurt, if I may add, we have talked about Horizon 22, right?
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:37.040]   And one of the strategic initiatives was to look at how do we lean our organization without
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   losing competencies, capabilities, but how do we lean and make the organization stronger?
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.800]   And I think what COVID-19 is doing to us, and I guess to many other companies out there,
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:54.240]   is accelerate the number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:01.160]   So along the lines that Peter was saying, I think we'll come out of this with some permanent
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.680]   cost reductions.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   And as we ramp up, we will not ramp up and inject back 100 million of cost.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:13.360]   How much, you know, we will remain to be seen because we're really learning as we're doing
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:18.240]   and we're just in the middle of it now, but we will definitely emerge out of that leaner
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   and stronger.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:26.560]   And there's certain categories like, for example, professional fees, subcontractors, where kind
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.200]   of as we work without fees, because those are, you know, kind of big categories of reduction,
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:37.920]   I think we were able to kind of live without a lot of that going forward.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:43.040]   So yeah, I think there's definitely a piece of that that we can carry forward.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:48.440]   And then there's certain examples that are not trivial, they're quite revealing, right?
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:53.920]   So we've got a very strong, you know, R&D and technical support organization, which is,
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:58.320]   you know, people that are centrally located and go and help plants.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:04.120]   And historically, a lot of the work was done by people going to the location.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:09.400]   Now, obviously, in the past three months, nobody's been able to travel anywhere.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:15.400]   And a lot of that has been done through remote interaction, video conference, but even when
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:22.360]   you go to a plant and you look at, I got a problem and I need to improve the speed on
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:29.920]   this mill, we've had people, you know, interacting by the mill pulpit on the face time and going
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:38.480]   into looking into the rolling mills by face time with a technical advisor on the other
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   side of the planet.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.920]   And that works actually fine, which we wouldn't have thought it would be possible.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:49.520]   So in the future, what you're gaining here is, well, you're saving travel time, which
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:57.480]   is not very good for the aerospace business, but also you're saying the cost, you're saving
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:02.240]   the time, which means that people can be on several interventions, whilst historically
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.720]   within a week, you know, it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:14.120]   So I think we're going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our, you know, space
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.320]   that are going to be quite interesting in the future.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:22.240]   And I think it's going to help us inject more brain and talent remotely with more activity.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.960]   And Kurt, you know, as we go forward, we may be able to give you more color on this.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:34.460]   But, you know, hopefully it comes across that we're really looking hard at taking structural
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.460]   costs out.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:40.800]   And in the short term, the objective is we want to be, you know, kind of free cash flow
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:47.520]   positive through this crisis, and so that we don't take on any incremental debt, ideally.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.600]   And in the longer term, we want to emerge with a, you know, kind of much stronger earnings
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   power.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:58.640]   So we're focused on exactly that, and, you know, we'll have more to say as we progress.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.640]   Okay.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.800]   Now, that's helpful.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.920]   And then, you know, in terms of the pre-cash flow, you know, dynamics, you mentioned I
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:13.640]   think a $73 million impact from backfiring this quarter, otherwise you'd be pre-cash
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.900]   flow positive, which is pretty positive given your utilization rate.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:23.680]   And now you're talking about 95% utilization and packaging over 80% and auto, and it seems
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.720]   like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:35.440]   So, you know, 75% of your business could be close to 90% utilization in a couple of months.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.660]   I get that arrow is weaker.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:43.880]   But it would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint, you know, unless working
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:49.600]   capital would be a major negative, you should be generating decent free cash in the back
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   half of the year.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.640]   Can you comment at all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year?
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   Yeah, sure.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   Thanks for the question.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.760]   I won't put a specific number on it, but we're confident that we will generate free
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.280]   cash flow for the full year.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:11.920]   And, you know, the back half of the year, I think there's a very good chance that we
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.640]   can, you know, generate some free cash flow, but it depends a lot on what happens with
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.640]   trade working capital.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.000]   As I said, we've got, you know, the ramp of these businesses.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.960]   So we want to be a little cautious until we see the pace of the ramp and the consequences
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.960]   of the ramp.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:33.440]   But again, for the full year, we remain confident that we can generate free cash flow.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.440]   Okay.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:40.720]   And then just final question on arrow, Mark, you had a comment on, I guess, working with
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   the OEMs to create, you said a clean slate entering 2021.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:52.480]   So, you know, is that statement kind of reflecting the fact that the OEMs cut very quickly?
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.880]   And I assume they're sort of an excess inventory issue that they're dealing with or in general
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.880]   on supply chain.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:04.120]   And so, you know, hypothetically, your volumes would be below the actual build rate to help
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.120]   them clear inventory.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:10.960]   So then when you get into 2021, you know, the supply chain is in a pretty good position.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.880]   And, you know, contractually, you said you're not going to force it on them.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:20.040]   But then, you know, if you're going to help them manage that, do they -- do you get anything
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:25.800]   in return, i.e., you know, price benefit or, you know, just kind of everyone helping
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.600]   each other, just a little bit of understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.600]   comment?
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.280]   Well, yeah, no fair question.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:39.520]   So, I think I've commented in the past on the fact that I thought that the shipments
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:46.440]   were making into the OEMs, right into the supply chain, were actually higher than what
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.080]   the build rates were warranting at the time.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.680]   And obviously, the build rates are going down very significantly down.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:49:00.440]   So now, so the pain we're going to take in the second half, I think is not going to cure
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:07.760]   all the, you know, inventory buildup in the supply chain, first of all.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:15.680]   But I think what that does is it positions us for 2021 that doesn't show further deterioration.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.360]   That's what we're into, right?
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.680]   And we want to be in a place where what we supply is, by and large, consistent with what
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.240]   is being built, right?
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.840]   So that's what we're trying to do, whether we get there fully, I don't know, but certainly
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:39.320]   we are aiming to be better in 2021 than what the nine months of post-COVID will be in ANP.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.040]   That's one of the goals.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:50.640]   In terms of what we're getting from the OEMs, we've got very strong deep strategic relationships
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.640]   with them.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.960]   I've commented also in the past on the fact that we're in it for the long haul.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.760]   And I think it's evidenced by the tenure contract we signed with Airbus.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:05.440]   I mean, tenure is a long duration, never happened before.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:12.840]   And we did it because it was the right thing to do for both companies, for both businesses.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.560]   And we didn't do it as a reaction to COVID or whatever, right?
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:22.680]   I mean, that was really the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.440]   So we're looking past the current crisis.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:30.600]   The current crisis, we've got to get all in the same boat or in the same aircraft and
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:35.120]   put us in the same place, work together to overcome the crisis.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.160]   And we are not talking about, you know, if I do that, you give me a bit more price or
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.160]   whatever.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:46.960]   It's just a relationship where we want to be in a win-win partnership and we do some
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.640]   things that help them, and they'll do some things that help us in the future, which I've
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:56.040]   already done in the past and that's already happened and that's continuing.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.040]   Okay, great.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.440]   Thank you very much.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:06.040]   Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields from Bank of America.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.520]   Your line is open.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:14.080]   Hey, Peter, one on the markets and then one on the balance sheet, please.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:22.360]   So, you know, saw that CAN volumes were down about 11 percent, but you know, Norse reported
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.120]   CAN volumes up 11 percent.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.480]   I think you guys face relatively the same markets in Europe.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:33.560]   Can you sort of point to why maybe they're having more success on their CAN volumes?
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:38.280]   Was it enough for SOC being down issue or a market issue or what?
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.680]   Can you just explain that discrepancy for us, please?
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.680]   Sure.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:48.400]   It's mainly, I believe, I mean, I cannot comment on their specific situation, but in our case,
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:53.120]   the main reason was that we had to take down NEPRISAC for a full week and then ramp it
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.120]   up gradually.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:01.440]   I remind you that NEPRISAC was at the center of a hotspot, the first real hotspot in France
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:08.240]   and that was a very terrible condition for the second half of March.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:14.880]   So in March, we continued to ship out of finished goods, but then we had to replenish the finished
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:22.280]   goods and that really took down our shipments in the second quarter, but we're back to normal
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:23.280]   now.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.280]   Okay.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.280]   Thanks.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.280]   That's sort of what I expected.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.680]   And on the balance sheet, it looks like you got a decent amount of funding from France
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:36.280]   and obviously Switzerland and Germany.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:40.200]   You said it was partially guaranteed, but it's also secured.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:45.560]   Can you just give us a better understanding of sort of what it's secured by?
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:50.800]   Is it inventory or is it sort of PP&E and then to what extent is it guaranteed by the French
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   government?
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:53:00.960]   Well, it depends on the facility, but the big one, the French one, is secured on PP&E
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   and in the case of the German ones, one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.200]   and the Swiss one is unsecured.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:16.360]   And the guarantees, the way they work is they guarantee a certain percentage of the principal.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   So it's a normal syndicate of banks with, in the case of France, I think the guarantee
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:30.360]   is for 70% of the, sorry, 80% in the case of France of the principal balance is guaranteed
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.560]   by the French state.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:38.040]   In the case of Germany, I think it's 80% too.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:43.960]   So just for our purposes as credit analysts, 80% of that French loan is sort of non-recourse
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   to you?
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:52.320]   Well, again, it is recourse to us.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:57.240]   What I think the point is, is that if you're a lender, so for example, if you're in the
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:04.920]   syndicate of banks and you are lending, say, 50%, your responsibility is for 10, oh sorry,
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:12.280]   50%, 50 million, your responsibility is for 10 of that, right?
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:16.880]   So it's the banks that benefit from the guarantee, not the company.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.880]   Okay.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.520]   So you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks?
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:23.840]   Absolutely.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.840]   Okay.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:32.200]   The government isn't backstopping the loan for you, it's backstopping the loan for the
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   banks.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.200]   Exactly.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   Exactly.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:42.880]   Another thing to kind of, I think is a really important point, is our intent in putting
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:49.440]   this liquidity on the balance sheet was to remove any question about the fact that we
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.400]   have enough liquidity.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:56.200]   As we said from the beginning and based on the performance in the second quarter, we
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.200]   do not anticipate using this.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:03.320]   So the French facility we had to draw, just by the terms of the agreement, but it just
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.960]   sits on our balance sheet as cash.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:12.120]   And the German facility that we've now signed up in July, we don't expect to draw that.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:16.280]   The delay draw term loan, we haven't drawn that.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:23.160]   And the Swiss facility, we don't have that drawn in most instances, so.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.720]   And the way we benefit from the state guarantee is through a very cheap interest rate.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.720]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   Right?
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.720]   That's right.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.680]   And that was important to us.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.080]   We don't think we need the money, so we're not going to pay a lot of interest for it.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.360]   Yeah, exactly that.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:43.480]   And it obviously was an inducement for the banks to lend.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.480]   Right?
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:50.920]   Now, fair enough, and I think the French facility is what, two and a half percent effectively
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.000]   at this point?
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   That's the code.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   All right.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.320]   So you don't really have an incentive to pay that off quickly, given your bonds or
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.000]   kind of twice that, right?
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.920]   No, that's right.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:10.040]   Now, remember, there are some limitations on the use of the capital, right?
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:16.080]   So for example, we can't use that capital to go and buy back bonds in the market.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:21.040]   So it's really meant to be for kind of operating needs of the company.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.040]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.600]   We don't have a strong incentive to repay that.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:32.280]   But what we will do is, obviously there's some cost to it, right?
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:37.200]   So as we kind of emerge from the crisis and have a little more visibility, then we'll
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.680]   unwind those facilities.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.960]   Okay, that's very helpful.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.480]   Thanks for all the color and good luck in the back-off.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.480]   Thank you.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   Thank you.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:52.880]   Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrock from Deutsche Bank, your line
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:53.880]   is open.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.880]   Hey, guys.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:01.080]   Thanks for taking my questions, and a really great job on transparency and costs here.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.720]   Both very helpful.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.720]   Thanks.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:09.120]   When you think about big picture, if you look at the auto market, there are sort of projections
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:16.000]   out in the market that will have about 25% decline in new cars this year, mostly based
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.520]   on the fact that we weren't producing back in March, April.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:24.640]   If you look at the used auto market, it's been pretty strong as a way to use prices
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:29.320]   really rising even above last year.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.520]   You talk about how production's been increasing and demand is increasing there.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:42.320]   To kind of get to down 25%, you'd have to have some pretty strong growth in 3Q and 340.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:49.000]   So I guess what I'm asking is, do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.360]   with demand pulling through based on a lack of cars?
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:55.880]   And if you can provide a little color what you're seeing there, that'd be very helpful.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:00.280]   Yeah, so then the auto book is strong.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   There's no question.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.400]   It's above the 80% that I'm mentioning, right?
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:13.920]   But we've been a little bit caught by customers just a few months ago telling us we need product
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.720]   tomorrow and then telling us the next day the plant is shut down, right?
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.320]   So we are very vigilant, right?
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:24.120]   So I hope--I think the end demand is there.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.080]   I think--and that's true in the US, that's true in Europe, right?
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:31.160]   The governments have injected a lot of money in the hands of consumers, right?
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:39.320]   Through the unemployment benefits of different shapes and forms that you see on both continents.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:44.480]   And that is pretty good for end demand at the end of the day.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:50.540]   So I hope it's going to be--it's going to materialize into--the older book we have is going to be
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:56.040]   actually real orders and shipments, in which case it should be better.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:59:00.920]   But, you know, I've--we've seen fits and starts.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:07.600]   You see plants restarting and then shutting down because there's COVID infections, or you
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:13.880]   see people having trouble staffing, you know, the false shift because there's too many cases
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.880]   in the hotspots.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.880]   So it's still fragile.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:23.880]   I mean, it looks quite good, but it's still fragile.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.880]   Right.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.880]   That's helpful.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:26.880]   Thank you, John Mark.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.740]   And I guess that's a good lead into the next question.
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:36.160]   So when you think about your customers, you know, we've had some shutdowns.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.560]   We've had things come back online.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:42.760]   Do you feel that your customers and their CEOs are getting more confidence in their ability
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:47.960]   to stay online or getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curve
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.960]   there?
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.480]   Yeah, I would think so.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:58.520]   I think all of us have made tremendous efforts to provide the proper environment for our
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.520]   employees.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.020]   It's very interesting.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:07.080]   I was commenting on the, you know, half of the percent of our employees have been affected
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:11.800]   by COVID confirmed.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:19.400]   We have had no new case, confirmed case in Europe since the middle of May.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:26.800]   So I think this is saying something about the fact that when people take responsibility
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.360]   in their daily lives, right, because it goes beyond what they do within our factories or
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:38.960]   during the eight hours or 10 hours, whatever, that they work with us, you can have an impact.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.760]   And I think, you know, if people wear masks, when they interact with the outside, with
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:50.200]   people they come across, I think it makes a tremendous difference.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:58.480]   So I hope the reality will slowly or more than slowly settle in and good practices will
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.480]   get that virus away from us sooner rather than later.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.200]   And I think people are seeing the confidence building up.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.880]   I mean, it's human nature.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.640]   You need to be affected to take steps.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.040]   And I think we're in a process where in many places people are still being affected before
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   they take steps.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:22.000]   But if you look at China, and China is going extremely strong, you know, it's a small operation
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.920]   for us, but we are above budget, above last year, right?
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:32.960]   You look at Europe, new cases are really on a downward trend, even though there are some
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   investors here and there, and we'll see a stronger rebound.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:44.040]   And I hope this is coming to us in the U.S. through the U.S.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.040]   That's great.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.560]   It's good to hear, John Mark, and I hope everybody is safe and well over there.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.300]   Thank you very much, and good luck.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.300]   Thank you.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.300]   Go ahead, sir.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.300]   Go ahead, Joanna.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.300]   Yes, sir.
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:04.080]   I am showing no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the conference back
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.480]   to Mr. John Marcher-Main, CEO of Constellium.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.480]   Go ahead.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.480]   Thank you, Joanna.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.560]   So thanks, everyone, for participating in the call today.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:21.200]   As you can see, we are very focused on facing the crisis, protecting cash flow, and building
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.960]   a stronger Constellium when things are behind us.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.960]   Thank you very much.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.400]   We hope to update you on our progress in Q3.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.400]   Take care.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.400]   Stay well.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.400]   Thank you, speakers, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400]   This concludes today's conference call.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.400]   Thank you all for joining.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:34.400]   You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Yeah, Dan, welcome to the next our Media Group Second Quarter 2020 results call.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Today's call is being recorded.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Giovanni and Vesta Relations.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Please go ahead, sir.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Thank you, Anna, and welcome, everyone.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I just want to read the safe harbor language after which we'll get to the actual presentation.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   All statements and comments made by management during this conference call,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   other than statements of historical fact, may be deemed forward-looking statements
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   for the purposes of the private security's litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Next are cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk or uncertainties
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   that may cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   by the forward-looking statements made during the call.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   For additional details on these risk or uncertainties,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   please see Nextar's annual report on Form 10(k) for the year end of December 31st, 2019
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   and Nextar subsequent filings with Securities and Exchange Commission.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Nextar undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   With that, it's now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to your host,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Nextar Chairman, President, and CEO, Perry, please go ahead.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Thank you, Joseph, and good morning, everyone.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Thank you all for joining us to review Nextar's record Second Quarter results today.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   As we get started, I want to acknowledge the Nextar Nation team members
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   for their frontline essential work and tireless efforts
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   to provide viewers and users with continuous access to local news and other services
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   despite the challenges presented by the pandemic and recent civil unrest.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   With our planning and preparation, strong balance sheet,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and commitment to our markets and employees,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm proud to say that Nextar has kept our employee roster intact
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and our record quarterly results again reflect our team's commitment to flexibility throughout this time.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   As always, our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Carter, is on the call with me this morning.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Nextar's industry-leading scale and diversification,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   our solid executions such as our new business strategies
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and our rapid adoption of cost containment programs at the onset of the pandemic
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   resulted in record Second Quarter results with all of our cash flow metrics
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   well above consensus expectations.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   The 41% rise in Second Quarter net revenue reflects growth
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   in total television advertising revenue as we grow year-over-year increases
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   in the same space as new television business and strong shares of political spending in our markets
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as the 71% year-over-year increase in distribution fee revenues.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   As such, despite the economic pressures related to the pandemic,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Nextar's top-lying growth in operating and expense management disciplines
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   resulted in a 38.7% increase in net income
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and record Second Quarter broadcast cash flow adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   with those net metrics growing 28%, 49% and 127% respectively on a year-over-year basis.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   As the world continues to address the health and economic challenges brought on by the pandemic,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   the strengths of our business model and enterprise-wide focus on managing operations for free cash flow
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   enabled us to bring about 21% of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   In the year-to-date period, Nextar has generated approximately $631 million of free cash flow
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   before one-time transaction expenses.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   By way of comparison, we generated a total of $521 million of free cash flow in all of 2019,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   so our growth momentum remains strong even before the upcoming benefit of political spending
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   in the back half of the year.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Reflecting repurchases made in Q1, we have reduced our share count to approximately 45.5 million shares outstanding,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   so 2020 year-to-date free cash flow per share amounts to about $13.86 per share,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   and we remain confident in our unique positioning in this environment to again generate significant free cash flow
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   in the current quarter and again in Q4 of this year.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Speaking of the full year 2020, it's important to remember that approximately 60% of our annual revenue
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   is expected to be derived from contractual distribution fee and political advertising revenue,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   which is not expected to be materially impacted by the pandemic.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Specifically, Nextar has solid visibility in terms of our contractual distribution economics
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   through December of 2022, as we completed new multi-year retent submission consent agreements
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   representing approximately 70% of our subscribers at year-end 2019,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   as well as new long-term network affiliation contracts with CBS, Fox and NBC.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   At the same time, Nextar has a strong balance sheet including approximately $665 million in cash as of June 30
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   with an access to another $140 million under our revolving credit facility.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   We continually successfully navigate through the evolving challenges presented by the pandemic
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   based on our core value of serving communities where we operate by delivering leading local news
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and other critical information and content to viewers, whether on air or online.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   In this regard, Nextar stations have produced 41 separate town hall meetings addressing state and regional responses to the virus.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Additionally, Nextar has generated over 30 different programs related to recent civil unrest and race relations in our communities.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   With local news and information, while it's never been more essential for Americans,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   the pandemic has changed consumers' media consumption habits in ways that showcase the inherent strength of local broadcast television,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   our content and Nextar's leading local brands.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   As the most powerful and trusted voice in the country, more people are turning into their stations local newscasts than ever before.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   According to Nielsen data, even as states and localities began to reopen in the second quarter,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   local broadcast television evening news viewership among adults aged 18 to 34 remained impressively high
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   with year-over-year increases in average cumulative weekly impressions in April, May, and June of 151%, 83%, and 89%, respectively.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Similarly, on the digital front, Nextar's websites and mobile apps grew year-over-year page views by 250% to 1.1 billion in April,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   with total monthly users up 133% to 96 million.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   We continue to generate strong digital audiences throughout the quarter with weekday and weekend page view traffic across our local websites
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   up 50% and 60% respectively during the months of June compared to the prior year.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Additionally, in terms of unique users, Nextar's digital properties ranked number one in the country in local news,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   number 12 in all of news and information, and with a number 33 site overall domestically in June as measured by ComScore.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   As the nation's largest producer of local news programming, Nextar's proprietary content provides essential news and information to users and viewers
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   that is unique and relevant to each of the local communities we serve across the United States.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Now more than ever, viewers rely on television news to stay informed about everything from the latest pandemic developments to the reopening of the economy to the upcoming election.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   With Nextar's market leading stations and sites, deep local and national reach,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   and local broadcast record of being the most influential and effective medium for both brands and politicians,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   we expect to see advertisers continuing to allocate increased spending to our broadcasts and digital platforms as this results.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Turning back to some second quarter highlights, total television advertising revenue increased 18.1% to 319.8 million,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   including political revenue of 21.6 million and core advertising revenue of 298.2 million.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   While local and national advertisers adapted their media plans during the second quarter,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   we saw sequential month over month improvement in our same station core advertising revenue performance from April to May, from May to June, and this trend continuing in July.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Notwithstanding marketplace challenges, Nextar's local sales initiatives continue to generate healthy levels of new business with second quarter new to television and revenue
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   rising on both a quarterly sequential and year over year basis.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   In total, our sales team generated $20.7 million of second quarter new to television revenue, marking 11.3% rise over the first quarter
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   and a 4.5% rise over the comparable 2019 period.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   As I mentioned at the outset of our call, our new business strategies, ongoing sales training, education, and deployment of performance-focused initiatives,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   combined with our sharing of best practices have proven very effective in our ability to capture ad spend share in both broadcast and digital locally.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   We recorded healthy levels of Q2 spending by political action committees and from candidates with 2022nd quarter political revenue of 21.6 million,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   exceeding our expectations from early in the quarter despite the cancellation of some primaries.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Both presidential campaigns have recently generated record levels of fundraising which bodes well for our upcoming political revenues trajectory,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   as such, our full year 2020 expectation for net political revenue in the low $400 million range remains unchanged.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Recent distribution agreement renewals and the inclusion of WGN America resulted in a 71% rise in second quarter distribution revenue
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   to 536.5 million, representing nearly 59% of total net revenue.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Second quarter 2020 total digital revenue declined by approximately $9.6 million or 17%, reflecting our focus on higher margin profitable operations,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   while digital profitability was up substantially over the comparable prior year period as our website and mobile app engagement also rose significantly.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Total combined second quarter digital and distribution fee revenue of $583.2 million rose approximately 57.1% over the prior year period,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   increased 64% of quarterly revenues up from 57% in the year ago period.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   The year over year increase in second quarter distribution revenue reflects the new agreements reached in the second half of 2019
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   and a realization of Trudian media revenue synergies related to the after-acquired clauses in our retransmission consent contracts
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   and, as noted, the inclusion of WGN America.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Our expectations for net retrans growth remain unchanged for the balance of the year in the mid-teens percentage range,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   reflecting new long-term network affiliation agreements with CVS Fox and NBC completed in the second half of 2019,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and as a result over 80% of our big four affiliations are contracted through December 31 of 2021
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   and over 70% of our big four affiliations are contracted through December 31 of 2022.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   With our successful 2019 renewal of retransmission consent agreements representing approximately 70% of our subscriber base,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   with approximately 17% of the base to be renewed this year,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   our significant net retrans revenue growth in 2020 will complement the strong political growth and spending that we're seeing,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   taking together the affiliation renewals, which also include OTT agreements, our new retrans contracts,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and sub-levels that remain in line with our forecast.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   We have pretty clear visibility for net retrans revenue growth expectations in 2020 and beyond.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   As we discussed on the last call at the onset of the pandemic,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   we took immediate action to adapt our business to address the economic impact on the use of U.S. commercial advertising market.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   We implemented a range of cost-cutting initiatives which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   in excess of $40 million from budgeted second quarter levels.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Looking at the third quarter, while the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   we're seeing the same pattern of month-over-month improvement in our pacing data
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   and expect to benefit from significantly increased levels of political ad spending.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And in fact, our July political billing exceeded that of all of Q2.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Overall, we're encouraged by continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and by key economic indicators including employment data and consumer spending.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And at present, we're cautiously optimistic about the return of live sports
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   as live news and sports programming continues to generate the strongest levels of viewership across our all demographics.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Additionally, preparations for the September 1 launch of WGN America's Primetime National Newcast News Nation,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   which will reach approximately 75 million households across the country, are proceeding on schedule and on budget.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   We're in rehearsals now and my first impressions of the product are very positive.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   News Nation will air daily from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and will draw on the local regional and national expertise
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   of NextGar's 5,400 journalists and 110 local newsrooms across the country.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And during the quarter, we announced the anchor teams and correspondents for our live three-hour Primetime National Newscast
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   were already attracting strong interest from leading national advertisers
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   at much higher than normal cost per points for WGN America.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Broadcasts will deliver news reporting that is fact-based, impactful and unbiased
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and we're confident that there are more Americans than ever before that were seeking just that.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   In addition to the live nightly newscast, News Nation's team of reporters and producers
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   will deliver news 24 hours a day online through News Nation's soon-to-be-launched app, News Nation Now,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   which will create another opportunity for monetization and revenue diversification.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   As always, we remain committed to generating free cash flow, actively managing our capital structure,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   our cost of capital and our liquidity position to provide the financial flexibility to support our business
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and enhance shareholder returns as we emerge from the pandemic.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   During the first half of 2020, we allocated approximately $594 million in cash from operations and investments
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   toward debt reduction, opportunistic share repurchases and cash dividends.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Distantly, as I mentioned before, NEXTAR continues to maintain a strong balance sheet
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   including $665 million cash on hand at June 30 with access to additional $140 million
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   under our Revolving Credit Facility. On the return of capital front in late June,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   we declared our third quarterly cash dividend at the new $0.56 per share level,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   which was 24% ahead of last year's payout.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   With our 191% year-to-date free cash flow growth, our contractual distribution fee revenues,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   our food network distributions, our historically low LIBOR rates which have reduced our interest expense
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and what is projected to be the biggest presidential election cycle in the company's history,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   we remain confident in our positioning to be free cash flow positive in every quarter of 2020
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   and we continue to expect NEXTAR's net leverage to decline to approximately four times by year end.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   In summary, while the pandemic has presented challenges for most every industry,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   NEXTAR's leading local platforms are well positioned to continue building the top line,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Over time, our disciplines in these areas have strengthened the resiliency of our business
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   and our business model and created an unrivaled local marketing platform
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   while supporting increasing and growing returns for our shareholders.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   With that said, let me turn the call over to Tom Carter for our financial review and update. Tom?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Thanks Perry and good morning everybody. As outlined in this morning's press release,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   the actual results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 reflect the company's legacy NEXTAR operations
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   and results from Tribune media stations which were acquired on September 19, 2019.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Second quarter 2020 revenue from WG in America also acquired in the Tribune transaction
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   is included in core television advertising revenue and distribution fee revenue.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Contribution from NEXTAR's 31.3% ownership stake in television food network
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   and other investments acquired in the Tribune transaction is included
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   in the full income statement under income or loss on equity investments net
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   and in the cash flow statement under distributions from equity investments.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   The comparable three and six month period ended June 30, 2019 reflects legacy NEXTAR operations during that period.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   All actual results also reflect the impact of one time transaction expenses
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   incurred in the quarters both in the quarters and the six month period ending June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   With that I'll with a review of NEXTAR's Q2 income statement and balance sheet data
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   after which I'll provide an update on our capital structure and some points of guidance.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   On a combined company basis and pro forma for the divested station
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   second quarter same station net total revenue was down 6%
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately 35%.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Reflecting a sharp decline in April due to the pandemic
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   and subsequent month over month improvement from April to May from May to June.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Same station distribution fee revenue was up 28%
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   and continuing digital revenues were down 18.2%
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   reflecting local agency services revenue growth of approximately 8%
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   while station website revenue was down approximately 30%
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   due to software local customer buying trends related to the pandemic.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   To offset the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on commercial advertising revenue
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   late in the first quarter NEXTAR implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   in excess of $40 million from budgeted levels in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Second quarter station direct operating expenses net of trade expense
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   were approximately $414 million up from $292 million in the prior year
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   primarily reflecting the full quarter of incremental expenses associated with the
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Tribune operations and the budgeted growth in network affiliation expense
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   as a partial offset to our rising distribution revenue.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Second quarter station SG&A was approximately $158 million
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   inclusive of the Tribune operations.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Same station pro forma fixed expenses excluding programming expenses
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   were down 18% over the year over year period due to synergies
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   related from the Tribune acquisition and the previously mentioned
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   expense reduction activities in response to the pandemic.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Corporate expenses were $35 million inclusive of $13 million of stock-based
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   comp and approximately $5.4 million of one-time transaction expenses.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   When excluding non-cash comp and one-time transaction expenses
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   recurring corporate expenses were approximately $17 million
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   which came in better than the guidance we had provided in the first quarter call
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   of approximately $21.5 million.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   By the end of April the vast majority of the initial operating synergies
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   of the Tribune transaction have been realized.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Second quarter operating cash taxes were approximately $6 million
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   substantially lower than our guidance of $45 to $50 million
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   due to a timing difference.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   That $40 to $45 million variance will now be paid in Q3.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Ongoing CAPEX and transaction CAPEX total $40 million
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   spectrum repack CAPEX total $13 million and received approximately
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   $26 million of reimbursements from the FCC during the quarter.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   As a reminder we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   spectrum related CAPEX over the course of the year.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Second quarter total interest expense amounted to $82 million
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   up from $51 million in the same period in 2019 while cash
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   interest expense was $78 million compared to $49 million last year
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   with increases due to obviously the increased debt associated
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   with the Tribune funding partially offset by lower interest rates.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Second quarter broadcast cash flow of $291 million as well as
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   adjusted EBICAU of $298 million and free cash flow of $200 million
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   all pre-transaction expenses exceeded consensus expectations
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   and primarily reflect the realization of synergies
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and growth related to the Tribune transaction.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Distribution free distribution agreement renewals
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   executed in the second half of the year and the deferred cash
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   taxes as I mentioned before.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Adjusted EBICAU and free cash flow reflect approximately
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   $27 million in distributions from equity investments related
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   to our 31% ownership in the TV Food Network.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   As a reminder we receive cash distributions from TV Food
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   on a quarterly basis with the largest payment recorded during
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   the first quarter of each year.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   For the third quarter of 2020 we anticipate recording
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   approximately $12 million in TV Food Network distributions.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   We expect cost savings in Q3 to approximate $25 million
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   relative to the originally budgeted levels as variable cost
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and discretionary expenditures are prudently brought back
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   online with the expected strengthening of the economy
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and the broadcasting advertising environment.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   For the third quarter we project recurring cash corporate
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   overhead exclusive of stock comp and transactions cost
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   to be approximately $23 million and we will easily meet
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   for approximately $120 million for the entire year.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Non-cash comp is projected to be approximately $13 million
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   for the quarter and $48 million for the full year.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Transaction expenses will approximate $3 million
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   for the quarter and will decline for the remainder
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   part of the year.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Third quarter operating cash taxes are now estimated
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   to be approximately $150 million and operating cash taxes
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   for the entire year will now come in at approximately
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   $250 million in total.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Non-operating cash taxes associated with the gains
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   on the asset sales and legal settlements in Q3
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   will be approximately $83 million.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Third quarter capex should come in at approximately $40 million
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   and we're still expecting approximately $160 million
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   for the entire year.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   We're proceeding on budget with our investment related
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   to the launch of WGN America's primetime national newscast,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   News Nation on September 1 and prioritized capital expenditures
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   to maintain maximum flexibility in the current environment
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   meaning the timing of certain capex can be delayed
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   until later quarters if required.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Finally we expect next hour's cash interest expense
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   to approximately $78 million for the third quarter
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   and $325 million to $350 million for the full year
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   reflecting interest expense savings related to the decline
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   in LIBOR rates.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Turning to the balance sheet, next hour's outstanding debt
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   at June 30 was approximately $8 billion
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   and consisted of $5.4 billion of term loans
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   and two series of senior subordinated notes,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   one at approximately $900 million
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   and the other at $1.8 billion with maturities of 2024
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   and 2027 respectively.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Total net debt approximated $7.4 billion
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   at June 30 compared to $7.6 billion at March 31
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and $8.3 billion at $1231, 2019.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Net debt for first lien covenant purposes is $5.2 billion
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   with net cash limited to a $200 million amount.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Our first lien covenant ratio at June 30
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   was approximately 3.11 compared to 3.52 at year end
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   which is well below our first lien covenant
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   of four and a quarter.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   As a reminder, our first lien covenant limits cash
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   netting to approximately $200 million.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Our total net leverage at quarter end was $4.47
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   compared to $5.18 at year end
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   and as a reminder, next hour's only covenant
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   is our first lien debt covenant
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   which is the aforementioned four and a quarter.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   At the onset of the pandemic,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   NexTAR took immediate actions to adopt our business
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   to the current environment to preserve liquidity
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   in order to best position the company for long-term success
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   as we return to normalized operations.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   In this regard, we continue to prioritize cash retention
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   and add approximately $231 million to our first quarter cash position
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   for a total cash balance of $665 million at June 30
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   with an additional $140 million available
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   under our evolving credit facility.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   At the same time during the second quarter,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   we returned approximately $25 million to shareholders
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   through the quarterly cash dividend
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   and made $13 million in payments on our debt.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   During the first half of 2020,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   we have accurately managed our capital structure,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   cost of capital and liquidity position
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   to support our business in this challenging environment
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   while enhancing shareholder returns.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Year to date, we have allocated approximately $594 million
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   towards shareholder value-creating initiatives,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   including $473 million in debt reduction,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   $51 million in dividend payments,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and $73 million in share repurchase.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   In the near time, while preliminary data suggests
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   ongoing sequential improvement in economic trends
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   and the commercial advertising environment,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   we continue to focus on cash preservation
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   in order to optimize our financial flexibility
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   as we move through the third quarter.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Looking ahead, with continued double-digit
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   year-over-year growth and distribution revenue
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and what are expected to be robust spending levels
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   related to the upcoming presidential election,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   which we do not expect to be materially impacted
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   by the coronavirus,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   we have excellent visibility on over 50%
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   of our annual revenue in 2020.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   As such, we expect to be free-crash flow positive
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   in the third and fourth quarters.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   In addition to continuing our dividend payments,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   we remain committed to allocating the vast majority
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   of our free cash flow towards leverage induction
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   and confident in reaching our target level
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   for the reduced level of coconut leverage
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   to four times by year end 2020.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   NEXTAR has already made significant progress
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   on our leverage reduction plan,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   and we enjoy a strong cash position
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   with additional capacity under our remover.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   In addition, the reduction in interest rate expense
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   related to favorable LIBOR rates,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   operating expense savings, and our capital allocation
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   prioritization will also serve us well
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   in the second half of 2020.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   As a result, we're confident in our liquidity position
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and ability to service our debt through these challenging times
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   as we move through the year.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   In summary, despite the unprecedented challenge
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   of the pandemic, our scale, leadership, flexibility,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   synergy realization, and operation plans
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   are generating results.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Our capital structure is in great shape
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   from a cost of capital, maturity, and ability
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   to quickly address leverage.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   In addition, our service to our local communities
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and local and national advertisers has never been stronger.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   as well as consistency and visibility to our results,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   and we remain confident in our ability
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   to enhance shareholder value in the near term
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and on the other side of the pandemic.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   That concludes the financial review for the call.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'll now turn it over back to Perry
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   for some closing remarks before Q&A.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Thanks very much, Tom.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   In summary, I hope that our comments today reinforce the fact
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   that we remain confident in the strength
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   and the resilience of NEXTAR's scaled
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   and diversified business model.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   NEXTAR's leading local platform is well positioned
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   to withstand this environment due to several factors,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   including our differentiated broadcast
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and digital sales programs, the continued growth
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   of our distribution revenue stream,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   and what are projected to be record levels
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   of political spending here in 2020.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   In terms of capital allocation,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   we believe that our free cash flow combined
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   with the active management of both our cost structure
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and our balance sheet will provide us
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   with financial flexibility to continue supporting
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   our shareholder value creation initiatives.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   As a result, NEXTAR is well positioned
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   to fully participate in the recovery,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and we remain highly confident in our core strategies
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   in terms of serving the communities where we have operations
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   and building the top line, maintaining close control
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   of fixed and variable costs, and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   This focus combined with our time proven operating strategies
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   is enabling NEXTAR to overcome the near term challenges
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   and extend our long term record of growth
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and shareholder value creation.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   We look forward very much to catching up with you
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   with another positive report just after election day,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   and on behalf of the entire NEXTAR nation,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   our board and our management team,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   thank you for your continued interest, support,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   and for joining us today.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   So now let's open the call to Q&A
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   to address your specific areas of interest.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Operator?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Yes, thank you, Carol.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And if you would like to ask a question,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   please click on my pressing *1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   If you are using a speakerphone,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   please make sure your mute function is turned off
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   to allow your signal to reach our equipment.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Again, that is *1 if you would like to ask a question,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   and we'll take our first question
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   from John Janities with Wulf Research.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Paria, two for you.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   One is you talked about local news and viewership.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   What are you seeing in terms of advertising
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   and growth in news relative to the day parts
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   given the ratings you spoke to?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And then I guess the sub-levels and line of expectations
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   is the re-truth that there's been no noticeable impact
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   from the pandemic, or is that your students' call given the life?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Well, as it relates to local news, you know,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   through the first six months of this year,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   51% of our total advertising revenue came from local news,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   and that's up over the prior year's cumulative totals,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   which indicates obviously advertisers, you know,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   are putting their money into that product
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   with increasing frequency.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Obviously, the demand is where the audience is,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and that's where the audience is for us right now,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and so we do see continued re-through,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   and we're hopeful that the audience gains,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   at least some of them will be sticky when, you know,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   and I hate to use this term,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   when the new normal settles in as to whatever that is,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   but so far through this normal,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   people in all age groups are tuning to our local news broadcasts
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   in increasing numbers.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   I will say that, I mean, obviously,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   MBPDs have reported sub-counts,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and attrition for the quarter, you know,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   those are factored into our projections and analyses,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   and our retrans revenue is, again,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   we forecast attrition into our budgeting process,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   and we are at budget on retrans revenue
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   and our projections through the end of this year,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   so we have seen no significant decline
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   beyond what we had forecasted,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   so we think it's business as usual
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   from a distribution revenue standpoint.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Thanks very much.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Our next question will come from Steven Cole
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   with Wells Fargo.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Thanks.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Wondering if you could talk a little bit about
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   your reverse compensation agreement
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   as sub-declines are accelerating.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   I was wondering if that's changing the tone of those at all,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   and also does it make you think about moving
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   from like a per sub basis,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   sorry, to a per sub basis from a fixed programming fee
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   where you can,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   and relatedly, we have more broadcast content
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   going direct to consumer like CBS All Access and Peacock,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   so how do you think about monetizing those households
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   that may not be subscribing
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   through the traditional process?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Sure, you know, I would say, you know,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   the current relationships with the networks
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   are a mix of fixed fee
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   and percentages of distribution revenue,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   so there are some that are fungible
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   and others that are not,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   and those conversations are continuing
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   what's in the best interest of both parties
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   to get a deal done,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   so there is some hedge there at this point,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   and we're not ready to call the ball
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   as to what the most preferable term is.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   They're based on our negotiating ability.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   As it relates to CBS All Access,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   we participate in that,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   we're paid to be a part of that service,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   and our local stream is a part of that offering.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Peacock, we are not affiliate local news,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast offering,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and we're not sure if at any point they will be,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   but, you know, we do have this thing called Over the Air,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   which, you know, we reach, you know,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   a much larger universe potentially
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   than the wired and pay cable universe already,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   where, you know, 16% of our viewers already use that
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   as their reception device
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   without the aid of a pay wall,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and that's available to those who want to quote "stream us" that way,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   if you will, and the good news about that
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   is there are far few competitors for eyeballs
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   in an Over the Air world
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   than there are in a 500+ cable or satellite universe,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   so, again, we are in flux.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   We have a lot of our agreements nailed down through '21 and '22.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   We do have some that will be up end of this year
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   and early next year,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   and that's where those conversations will center around
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   what's the best type of agreement
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   for both companies to enter into.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Great, and then just one on political.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Four years ago, we kind of got a head take
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   at the last minute from the Trump campaign
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   in terms of not spending what was expected.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   I don't think any of us expect that to happen this time,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   but when do you feel comfortable
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   that there's not going to be any negative surprises
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   on the political spending side?
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Well, I'm pretty comfortable in that right now.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   I mean, look at the amount of money that both camps have raised
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   that the attendant PACs and special interest groups
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   have raised supporting those candidates
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   as well as down valid candidates.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   You know, there are no guarantees in this business,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   but as close as a guarantee as I'll make you,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   there'll be no negative surprise on political advertising.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   That's a pretty good guarantee. Thank you.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   We'll now take our next question from Zach Silver with Bea Riley.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Okay, great. Thanks for getting the question.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   The first one is just if you can quantify the sequential improvement
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   for core in July versus total two to 20
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   or even the pro forma year over year change so far in July.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And more broadly, and I think it's a little bit related
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   to Steven's question, you know, the narrative out there
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   has been that the macro environment and growth in streaming
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   is going to accelerate the shift of ad dollars
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   from linear TV to connected TV and streaming.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Can you talk about how well positioned you are to address that
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   if that narrative does turn out to play out?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   I'll let you address how linear you want to get on guidance.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Obviously, we saw substantial sequential improvement
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   in that trend in July versus not only June but the entire quarter.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Tom, I don't know if you want to add any more details to that,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   but I'll let you speak to that.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Sure. Well, I think what I'll say about July is obviously
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   July was substantially better than the second quarter as a whole
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   and July was better than the last month of the second quarter.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   So sequentially things have gotten better
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   and that trend continues into early Q3.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   As it relates to additional streaming services,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   you know, at some point there becomes kind of a sameness to them
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   and, you know, it's all about the content.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   If you have the content that people want,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   they will find a way to consume you,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   whether that's over the air or whether that's through a pay service
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   or through a streaming service that we're paid to be on.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And without our services,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   you have an inferior offering to the viewing public.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   It has obviously demonstrated that local news is a product
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   that people want and are willing to pay for.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And so I think we'll just stand by that.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   You know, it's a lot less noisy at the operating level
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   than it is perhaps at the investor level about these streaming services.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   You know, is it a fragmenting universe,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   but are they just taking from a wire, you know, from a traditional pay TV universe
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   into a virtual pay TV universe?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And if so, and we're on both sides of that transaction,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   it's not, you know, it's not nearly the noise
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   that it appears to be in the investment community.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   So we're somewhat sanguine about it.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   You know, we have a product that people want
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   and we're the largest producer of it in the country.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   It's called Local News.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And we believe that product will stand the test of time
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   as it has for the last 40 years, test of time.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Yeah, I think that makes sense.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And one more if I could.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Does the -- I guess for Tom,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   does the target leverage ratio for this year contemplate any buybacks
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   in the second half?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   And can you remind us of where we are in resuming your purchase program?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Thanks.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   It does.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   I won't say how much of it is allocated to stock repurchases.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   The way we think -- we have an authorization left from the board.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   We're currently not buying stock,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   but I would anticipate that to get revisited here
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   in the not too distant future.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   The way we think about it is really starting on Labor Day.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And quite honestly, that's probably not doing service
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   to the fact that it's pretty mentioned.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   July political revenue is very strong
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   and we think August will be as well.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   We're rapidly transitioning out of this being a story
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   during the pandemic just about poor advertising revenue
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and what's happening there.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   The other leg -- two legs to the stool from our perspective,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   distribution revenue has been strong, continues to be strong,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   as Perry mentioned.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   We're on budget for the year.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   We're on budget for the second --
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   we were actually above budget for the second quarter.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   We're on budget for the third quarter with regard
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   to retransmission revenues.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   And then the third leg of the stool is political,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   and that's really going --
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   that candle is going to get lit here right around Labor Day
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   and run really hard for the two months of September, October,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and the first week of November.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   So the free cash flow of the company will continue
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   to go along nicely and then get turbocharged
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   by free cash flow from political beginning around Labor Day.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   As I've said to other people,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   I fully expect our capital allocation attitude
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   to change from playing defense to playing offense
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   sometime right around Labor Day.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   We're not there yet, but I can see there from here.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   And when that happens, then I would imagine we wouldn't sit here
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   with an unnatural $600 million of cash on our balance sheet.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   We deploy that by actually repaying debt
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   and looking at stock repurchases,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   but that's a multivariable equation.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Tell me what the stock is around that time,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   and I'll tell you what our appetite is.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Is that responsive?
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you both.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I just want to add to Tom's comment about political.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Most folks woke up this morning reading about the, you know,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Biden's buy that he's placing starting on September 1st
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   in 15 states.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Well, we operate substantial operations in 12 of those 15 states.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   So just to point out that, you know,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   political will reach a crescendo around Labor Day
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   that will continue on through the first week of November.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   And again, with July results being above all of second quarter
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   for political, you know, that's a pretty good,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   pretty good measure, I think, of what's yet to come.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And so we remain confident in our political guidance.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And as that story continues to prove,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   then I think you'll see Tom exercise more optionality
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   around our cash forward that currently exists on the balance sheet.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Got it. Thanks, Gary.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Well, now, take our next question from Erin Woff with Deutsche Bank.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Hi, guys. Thanks for having me on.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   A couple questions on the ad environment.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   I guess first, there's been some fits and start in terms of COVID
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   cases in the pockets of the country.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   What behavior has been affected in your markets that have been
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   affected by that?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   And I guess on a related note in terms of categories,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   just give me the importance of the auto category.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Anything you can give us in terms of how that rebound is
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   shaping up and what you're expecting from auto in the next
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   couple of months?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Yeah, auto has rebounded.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   You know, we're seeing better pacing and better results in Q3
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   than we did in Q2 when dealers were shut down.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   We're seeing certain of the OEMs move money around from
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   market to market based on where they have cars,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   and that's primarily affected some of the foreign nameplates.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   But on the whole, I think our expectations for auto are that
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   it will be less down sequentially going forward as will
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   most of core advertising.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   As it related to COVID, I didn't know if you meant how it
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   affected the company or what we're seeing in our markets,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   but I can give you a little color on both.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   We have had 145 confirmed cases in the company since
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   the beginning of the pandemic.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Remarkably out of a workforce of about 13,000,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   that, you know, a few people that are out in the community,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   we've only had one hospitalization and that person
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   is fully recovered.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   About 60% of our employees are working from the facility
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   to which they are assigned.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   We have another 20% that are reporting to work,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   but not necessarily in the facility.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Reporters meeting their crews in the field to go to their
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   first assignment and things of that sort.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   And we have another 20% that are working remotely.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   And, you know, I use the example with our board that,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   you know, everybody in Topeka is reporting to work.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   However, nobody is populating our New York offices because
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   of the public transportation requirements,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   and they don't feel safe, and there's certainly
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   no mandate to do that.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   And so that's kind of a proxy for the country.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   You know, we keep tabs by every market as to, you know,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   various stages of reopening.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   I would say that all of our markets have some degree
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   of reopening, some more than others.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   There have been some pauses in California and Texas
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   and others on further reopening.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Areas have been rolled back, you know,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   bars and restaurants are not necessarily big advertising
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   categories with us to begin with.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   But hospitality continues to be a category where we see
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   no spend to speak of.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   There is some interest state tourism ads that are going on.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Like if you're in Texas, come to Arkansas and vice versa
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   in Oklahoma, we're seeing some of that.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   But hospitality for us is a sub 2% category that,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   you know, is not materially driving our top line.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   So Aaron, I don't know if that's the kind of flavor
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   you were looking for, but I'm happy to answer any more specific
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   follow-up.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   One last one for me, and I appreciate the time again.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   You spoke to the important local news and the ad revenues
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   that come in attached to that to the overall revenue pie.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   If we're thinking about the potential that maybe NFL football
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   is delayed or college football doesn't happen in the fall,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   how do we think about the flow through of that potential
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   and what it could mean to your revenue pie?
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   Sure, I'm glad you asked that.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   It's interesting at the local station level,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   which is where we live, all sports comprises about 10%
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   of our advertising revenue.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   And of that, the NFL comprises about 60% of that 10%.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   So let's just in real round numbers say that ad revenue
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   support is half of our revenue and NFL is 6%
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   of 10% of that.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   So we're talking about three points of revenue.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   So from an advertising perspective, because of the limited
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   avails that the local stations get in all of local sports
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   or all of televised sports that's not local,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   it's not that big of a contributor,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   but obviously it has an outsized effect on viewership,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   on promotional ability, and I would say on the national psyche
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   and on people's morale.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Obviously distributors are very interested in live sports
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   because they know live sports and live news drive viewership,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   but from a pure financial advertising point of view,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   it's not all that material to our top or bottom line.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Okay, perfect.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   That's exactly what I was looking for.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Stay well guys.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Thank you.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Our next question will be from Brian Kraut
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   with Deutsche Bank.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Hi, I have two questions.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   First, wondering if you could give us some color on what
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   you're seeing in terms of subscriber declines in your markets,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   curious how they compare to the overall industry,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   and any color on advertising and distributor reception
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   to News Nation and any expectations for when you might see
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   some incremental revenue lift from News Nation.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Thanks.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Tom, I'll let you read the subscriber and then I'll talk
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   about Kia and how's that?
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Sure.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   I would say our experience with subscribers is not materially
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   different than that of the MVPDs.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Obviously we are still getting an uplift from the virtual MVPDs
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   so that the traditional MVPD subscriber loss is somewhat
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   recouped, but certainly not all recouped by the virtual MVPDs.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   And as Perry had mentioned, obviously we factor in in our
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   budgeting process and in our guidance process and attrition
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   rate for subscribers and a unit rate for our revenue.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   And as we mentioned, that was basically in line for the
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   second quarter and early returns for the third quarter are
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   consistent with that expectation.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   So not getting into specific subscriber decline numbers,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   et cetera, I would say that we see and feel the same thing
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   that the distributors do.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   It's just that our economics are a little bit different
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   because we've got rate that helps us offset that,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   but it's consistent with our expectations.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   As relates to WGN America, we have had and Dana Zimmer
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   and her team have been out presenting WGN America to
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   every MVPD which we already do business and also those that
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   do not carry WGN, WGN America, and that's primarily in legacy
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   next star markets and we have an opportunity with renewals
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   between now and the end of the year for an incremental
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   approximately 200 to 250,000 subs that could add WGN America
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   and these are smaller systems.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Again, where NECCAR has a relationship but there was no
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   trivial relationship that would have included WGN America
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   so there is upside there and I would say that the reception
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   from distributors has been positive particularly from those
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   who have existing contracts and realize there's going to be
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   additional value add for no additional cost during the term
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   of the current agreement.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   We are distributed on AT&T now as the only virtual MVPD
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   service that is offering WGN America.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   We are efforting to get distribution at the launch
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   or shortly thereafter on other OTT services and that will be
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   a value add where WGN America is not currently distributed
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   but the reception from both the advertising community
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   and the distribution community has been positive
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   because we're investing in a product that will add value
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   to their businesses as well.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   >> Great.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   Thanks, Perry.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Thanks, Tom.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   >> We'll take our next question from Dan Acredos
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   with Benchmark.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   >> Thanks.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Good morning.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Slim Pickens last year after the strong print
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   and all the questions, but I guess I'll ask you one follow-up
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   to the prior, Perry.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   I don't know if you're willing to sort of, you know,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   good color on subcarriage incremental opportunity.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   Is there any way for us to think about sort of timing
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   and how you're thinking about the news nation impact
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   itself relative to either advertising or, I guess,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   ancillarily with that, your comment on carriage.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   I know it's going to be self-funding.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Obviously, you have plans to kind of expand it.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   So just any help kind of framing your thoughts
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   And then separately, you know, obviously there's been
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   a lot of noise lately in the digital world,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   Facebook, Twitter, Advoid products, all of that fun stuff.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   You guys are the largest.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   You guys have a pretty big network effect
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   and a pretty strong digital portfolio yourselves.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   Is there any accrued benefit to you guys
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   that you think that stays mostly in the digital bucket?
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Thanks.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   I'll speak first to WGN America.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   We have -- I'm very impressed with the job
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   that Dave Rotem and the sales team have done
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   in assembling advertisers for the premiere,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   premiere week of WGN America's news nation.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Blue Chip names and at cost per points
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   that are in excess of --
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   I'm sorry, I should say cost per thousands
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   that are in excess of 50% greater
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   than what standard programming was generating alone.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   So that's a very positive initial indication.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   We're trying to rework some of the existing buys
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   into the news nation primetime offering.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   And so what we could really use is, you know,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   an upfront or a fourth quarter scatter market to break.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   But all of that said, we do anticipate an incremental,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   let's call it low, eight-figure revenue contribution
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   to WGN's ad revenue in the four months of the end of this year.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   And again, given the size and scope of the operation
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   that wouldn't be deemed to be material,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   but we do even in these conditions expect, you know,
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   a low eight-figure uplift in gross revenue there.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   And distribution that will mostly come at the end of the year,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   so will impact 2021 more than this year.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   There have been some incremental deals done already
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   that will launch WGN America, you know,
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   between now and the end of the year.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   But I would say the vast majority of that impact
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   would be felt in 2021.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   And again, you're talking a potential uplift of, you know,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   a quarter of a million subscribers on a, you know,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Nielsen reported, I think, 75 million subscriber base.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   So even that is incremental.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   But it's all incremental, and that's what we're going to do,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   is drive incremental growth out of the assets that we own.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   And then the thoughts on either Facebook, Twitter,
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   as it relates to core political,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   if that stays in the digital bucket,
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   or if you could pick some of that up.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   Yeah, listen, I think the most direct transfer could be in political.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   You know, if certain platforms are refusing those ads,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   that money has to go somewhere.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   And, you know, without conventions to fund,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   and without rallies to fund,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   the one way to reach people is through broadcast television.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   I think we're seeing an evidence of that right now.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   So I think that would be probably the direct transfer.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   You know, with all the boycats and all of that,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   I don't think you've seen a substantial decline
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   in digital revenue performance on those platforms.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   So at this point, the damage is more reputational than financial.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   And we'll see, you know, how deep the government wants to get involved
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   in taking a look and potentially regulating these companies
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   more symmetrically with the way we're regulated.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   But at this point, I think the financial transfer outside of political
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   to the best of our knowledge is minimal.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Got it. Super helpful. Thanks for the color in the next quarter.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   Thanks.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Our next question will come from Greg Hubbard
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   with Hubbard Resource Partners.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   Yes, good morning. Thank you.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   A few questions.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   Last quarter on your conference call,
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   I believe you guys said your retrans subs were down 4.5%
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   year over year.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   As you guys may know, Sinclair on the call right before yours
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   said the second quarter subs were down about 7%.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Clean a bit benefit in the virtual side.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Should I assume that you guys were down roughly about 7%
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   for the second quarter for your subs? Is that reasonable?
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Slightly worse than the first quarter? No.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   No?
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Should I assume it's a little bit better than that then?
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Or can you just help me understand your --
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   I would say it's more consistent with the second quarter.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   The second quarter -- I'm sorry,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   you need more consistent with the first quarter down 4.5%.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Sorry, with what we announced, the first quarter.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   You're right, first quarter.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   But no, I wouldn't say it's down 4.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Craig, I'm not going to give the exact number.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   I've already said that.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   It's not down 7, but it's closer to the previous quarter's results.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Okay, I appreciate that.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Can you help us --
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   your TV advertising pay scenes for the month of August,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   say that those are tracking better,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   the rate of decline there if your core advertising for that
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   is tracking better than what July turned out to be?
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   I think it's a little -- we have very few days in August here.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   I'm thinking it's a little too early to be making any comments
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   with regard to that.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Okay, can you help us then maybe just --
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   to understand then what you're sort of budgeting
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   or thinking the rate of decline for your core advertising
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   could be down in the third quarter?
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   Craig, I think that's why we're not giving guidance, right?
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   It's going to be down --
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   How much July was down, if you would?
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   I think I told you it was down less.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   Again, I'm not going to give specific numbers,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   but July was down less than June,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   and June was obviously -- it's just math.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   If the entire quarter was down 35 percent
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   and every month within the second quarter got better,
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   then clearly June was down less than 35 percent,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   and July was down less than June.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   That's kind of the extent of the forward-looking guidance
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   that we're going to give as it relates
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   to specific advertising revenue.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Okay, maybe --
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   let me ask another question then.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   In this -- on this virus situation that's going out there,
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   in the states where the virus cases have gotten
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   dramatically worse here in the last several weeks,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   have you guys seen a material change
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   in the core TV advertising in those markets?
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   Is there any significant change
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   in talk about that?
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   No, and again, you know, cases in Texas have gone down.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   I mean, yeah, but we don't operate
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   just in one area that you're in
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   that you might be hearing that news from, right?
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   So you've got to look across 114 markets
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   and look at, you know, those states and, you know,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   cases might be reported to be up 30 percent,
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   which could be 100 cases in a state.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   I mean, you've got to put all of these numbers
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   into context.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   But I would say, no, the evidence is in, you know,
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   in our results in July and our pacing in August
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   and our pacing in September, all substantially better
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   than where we exited second quarter
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   and then we performed in second quarter.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   So, you know, the proof is in the numbers.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   As Tom says, it's just math.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   But, you know, we have not seen any --
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   and I think I just said this, you know,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   hospitality continues to be down, auto is improving.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   We don't get a lot of money from restaurants
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   unless it's QSR and they're making mince
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   through their drive-thru.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   So, you know, things are --
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   we are seeing steady improvements
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   and even we're, you know, pausing and opening
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   is better than not being open at all.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   And that's kind of our worst case scenario
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   in some of our markets and in others, we don't have that.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   You know, this morning we're dealing with the aftermath
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   of storms up the East Coast from the Carolinas
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   into Virginia and up into Pennsylvania, New York,
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   and flooding and those kinds of things.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   And those are going to be more, you know,
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   temporary disruptors to businesses
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   until they can reopen than the pandemic.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   And so it's situational and we deal in 38 states
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   across the country and you've got to add it all together.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   But there's, you know, nothing other than business
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   as usual is the way we deal with things
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   and I think the results speak for themselves.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   And my last question, guys.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   On the cost front, you guys talked about pro forma costs
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   in the second quarter down 18%.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   Can you give us a little bit more to how we --
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   should we think about your cost trends for the third quarter?
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   I know you gave a figure there versus your budget
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   for the third quarter.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   You gave us somewhere one for the second quarter.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   But just what sort of cost that you could help us a little bit
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   think about that may not repeat the cost savings
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   on the third quarter you benefit from in the second quarter?
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   Thank you.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   I really don't understand the question other than the fact,
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   obviously, we had guided to $40 million
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   in cost takeouts in the second quarter,
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   which we believe -- which we overperformed on.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   That same number for the third quarter is $25 million
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   as we -- obviously, some of those are variable costs
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   as advertising starts to return, those costs go up.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   Some of them are discretionary that we will add back in.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   We will travel more in the third quarter
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   than we did in the second quarter.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   We basically couldn't have traveled any less
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   in the second quarter than we did.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   So some of the discretionary costs will get added back in.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   But that will be more than offset
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   by higher advertising revenues in the second quarter,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   but specifically as it relates to, you know,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   if you're looking year over year,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   the majority of the synergies taken out of the Tribune transaction
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   have occurred.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   So that won't change materially -- sequentially Q2, Q3 over Q2,
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   and you'll have some added expense coming back in.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   But that's the extent of some of the pushes
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   and the pulls on expenses.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   You answered it well. Thank you. Appreciate that, guys.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   We'll now take our next question from John Cornwright
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   with J.K. Media.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   I hope you can hear me having heard problems
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   like a lot of people in the neighborhood.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Two quickies.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Tom, I think the 24 bonds were callable two days ago,
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   and I heard nothing.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   Does that mean that it's not likely to be called?
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   Well, again, John, I think that's consistent with our message
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   that, you know, in the next 30 to 45 days,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   I think we will have a better view
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   on actual political revenue coming in, you know, Labor Day
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   and obviously same with another month of core,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   and we'll be able to start making more aggressive decisions
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   with regard to capital allocation in the --
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   you know, obviously in the last 120 days
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   and probably the next 30 days,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   we're still going to continue
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   to take a pretty conservative view on that,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   but hopefully be able to flip the switch
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   and become a little bit more aggressive in the near term.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Secondly, did I hear correctly that your own track
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   for mid-teens net returns growth this year,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   and you mentioned that the growth --
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   the growth returns is up high 20s, pro forma.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Did I hear correctly,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   growth up high 20s net mid-teens?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   So far this year, our retrans revenue growth
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   has exceeded 20%, if that is correct.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   We have budgeted for mid-teens --
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   yes, well, 28 in the second quarter.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   I don't get what exactly the first quarter is.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   We've budgeted for mid-teens growth
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   in net retrans for the entire year,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   but so far we have exceeded that.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Okay, so net retrans margins are downward,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   you know, more than a little bit this year.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Is that correct?
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   No.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   I would say that they're actually up a little bit
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   because we've included a fair amount of probune subscribers
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   that are non-Big Four affiliates
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   where our net retrans margin, you know,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   is substantially in excess of 50%.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   Got it.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   Thank you very much.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   And we'll now take our next question
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   from Jim Goss with Barrington Research.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Thanks.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   During the early days of the pandemic,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   there seemed to be a surge or a pretty good increase,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   at least, in usage and even sampling of broadcast
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   and other video in categories that didn't take --
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   or didn't tend to --
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   before to be requested.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   If you would like to cancel this request,
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   please press Star Zero again.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   I'm not sure what happened there.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   But I was wondering if any of that has proven sustainable or --
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   before to be canceled.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   If you would like to cancel this request,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   please press Star Zero again.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   I'm sorry, I may have heard.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   I had, Jim, I think somebody's trying to either record
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   or exit the call.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   Okay, sorry.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   But anyway, I was wondering if any of the increased usage
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   and sampling has proven sustainable
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   or has it mostly dissipated?
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   Did any of that play a role in your retrans negotiations
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   during that period?
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   We had precious few retrans negotiations done
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   in the first half of the year.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   We had one top ten that we're, you know,
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   we're pleased with the results on.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   I would say, you know, in my comments earlier,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   I did report that, you know, our viewership --
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   and I highlighted the 18 to 34 demographic, you know,
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   obviously was up in April 151%,
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   83% in May and 89% in June over the prior year.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   Our digital page views, which were in excess of $2.3 billion
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   for the quarter were $1.1 billion in April.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   That was up 133%.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   And then in the month of June, just by comparison,
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   our local websites were up 60% compared to the prior year.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   So, you know, there is some COVID fatigue, I think,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   but I also think there is increased interest in local news
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   and we consider ourselves to be the last bastion
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   of local news with the diminuation of newspaper
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   and radio local coverage and content.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   So, you know, we do think that there is stickiness to this.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   You know, the long tail will determine how much,
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   but people continue to turn to our newscast
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   and record numbers.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   And it's amazing.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   You see, ATLA in Los Angeles and WGN in Chicago,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   independent stations by and large,
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   but producing copious amounts of local news
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   are ranking number one in all day cards,
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   beating all of the network O and O's in virtually every newscast.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   And that just speaks to the power of localism
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   that you're not dependent on network lead-in or lead-out
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   to generate your audience.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   You're doing it on your own
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   and we're particularly gratified by that kind of execution
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   producing those kinds of results.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   Okay.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   And one last thing.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   I was wondering about the promotion efforts
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   to create visibility for News Nation,
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   as that is, you know, coming to the fore.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   And also, it seems like CNN tended to fill a similar role
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   to that which you're targeting
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   where it tended to be unbiased,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   maybe it's a little less so these days.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   And in that era, it would tend to be the place to go
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   when something, an event occurred,
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   but some of the other news, more pointed newscasts politically
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   would sort of gather their base in more normal times.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   So I'm wondering if there's a way for you to position yourself
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   to, you know, sort of gather at least that role
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   and maybe, you know, maybe have something more sustainable.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   And if this proves successful,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   do you think you've broadened it
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   beyond the three-hour original timeframe?
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   Well, thanks Jim.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   There's a lot in there to unpack.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   I'll try and do my best with it here.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   You know, obviously, you know, that is how CNN started.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   I don't think anyone listening to this call
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   thinks CNN is in that same place today
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   from an unbiased political lean.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   We, as I've said before, we have a staff of rhetoricians
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   and two full-time staff that do nothing but check scripts
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   and reporting for unconscious bias
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   and bias in our writing,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   and we've had very spirited discussions about that
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   even in the rehearsals.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   You know, we do think we will be that place to go
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   for news that doesn't make a, you know, 22-minute news hole
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   in a network evening news broadcast
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   or much news on the opinion-based, you know, talk networks.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   You know, for example, last night in our rehearsals,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   we did a story on the first women police chief
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   in Colorado Springs,
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   and that's not a story you'd see every place else,
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   but again, we've got our,
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   we've got the country divided up into six zones,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   and we have zone producers,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   and their job is to know exactly what's going on
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   in those zones, in all of those newsrooms,
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   and what might be of interest to a national audience.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   In addition to the 150 people we hired in Chicago,
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   correspondence that are also based in Miami, New York,
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   Dallas, Los Angeles, and D.C.,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   that report exclusively for the network,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   as well as all the behind-the-scenes production folks
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   that we think we can give a more representative view of America
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   than perhaps what's seen inside the New York D.C. beltway.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   So we think there's a purpose for that
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   and there's a reason for that,
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   and the acceptance of that concept now
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   has been very enthusiastic.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   It's now just on us to deliver.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   As it relates to promotion,
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   we have secured something that none of the other networks,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   news networks, I think, are able to compete with,
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   and that is to harness the power of 196 television stations
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   across the next star nation to promote this newscast
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   on a day-to-day specific basis beginning later this month.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   And if you look at the annualized promotion value
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   that the stations will be contributing on a dedicated basis,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   it's something approaching $100 million.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   We are layering on top of that on an annualized basis
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   approximately $20 million of outside promotion expense,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   which primarily goes for advertising on other cable networks
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   because we're just a channel change away at that point
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   on national and syndicated radio.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   We're also investing heavily in social media
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   not only because of the app,
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   but to try and drive a younger demographic
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   to an alternative newscast.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   And so we think our promotion spending,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   all taken together,
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   a nine-figure amount of both cash
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   and in-kind contributions for the company,
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   are another asset that will hopefully drive success
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   for this effort.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   And again, it is a counter-programming opportunity
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   in prime time, and we're going to do our best to succeed there.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   Obviously, if we are successful,
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   we would look at other day parts,
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   but we're taking very much of a crawl-walk-run approach to this.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   We want to get it right,
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   and we will grow as fast as our success would allow us to grow.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   So I think I'd leave it at that,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   but we're very excited about the prospect
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   of introducing an alternative in prime time
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   to entertainment, sports, and opinion programming
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   and that the product will reach a --
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   will strike a chord and resonate with the audience,
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   and, you know, audience growth and advertiser growth will continue.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   So tune in.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   It launches on September 1st.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   Thanks for your care for a while.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   And that does conclude our question and answer session for today.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   I might turn the conference back over to Mr. Silk for any additional
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   or closing remarks.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   Well, thank you, Operator.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   Again, we're very pleased at our progress
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   and we're pleased at our strong financial position
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   and we're excited about the launch of WGN America
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   and the advent of the political spending season
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   that will all be upon us before our next call.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   So we look forward reporting back to you shortly after Election Day
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   with the early results on all of those efforts.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   And thank you very much for your time this morning.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   And once again, that does conclude today's conference.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   We thank you all for your participation.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Aldera's therapeutic
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.800]   second quarter 2020 financial results conference call.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.360]   At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.400]   After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.680]   To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.120]   If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.460]   If you require further assistance, please press star zero.
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.800]   I would now like to introduce the company's chief financial officer, Mr. Josh Reedy.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.340]   Mr. Joshua Reedy, thank you, you may begin.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.360]   Thank you, and good morning everyone.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.520]   On the call with me are Dr. Todd Brady, Aldera's president and chief executive officer, and
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.400]   David McMullen, our chief commercial officer.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.880]   Dr. Brady will begin with an overview of our recent highlights and upcoming clinical milestones.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.800]   I will discuss our second quarter financial results, and then we'll take your questions.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.600]   Please note that this morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements regarding
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.720]   future events and the future performance of Aldera.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.840]   Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the timing of planned clinical trial
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.360]   initiation, Aldera's possible or assumed future results of operations, expenses, and financial
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.520]   positions, business strategies and plans, research development and commercial plans
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.520]   or expectations, trends, market sizing, competitive position, industry environment, and potential
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.800]   growth opportunities, among other things.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.920]   These statements are based upon the information available to the company today.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.400]   As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical site availability, staffing, and patient recruitment
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.760]   have been negatively affected, and the timelines to complete our clinical trials may be delayed.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.360]   Aldera assumes no obligation to update these statements as circumstances change.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.760]   Future events and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the company's
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.960]   forward-looking statements, including the current and potential future impact of the COVID-19
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.800]   pandemic on our business, results of operations, and financial positions.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.880]   No information concerning factors that could cause results to differ materially from our
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.560]   forward-looking statements are described in greater detail, and the company's press release
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.320]   issued this morning containing financial results for the quarter-ended June 30, 2020, and the
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.080]   company's filings with the SEC.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.800]   And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Todd Brady, our president and chief executive
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   officer.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.840]   Thank you, Joshua, and good morning, everyone.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.760]   As our industry and healthcare first responders continue working together to defeat the worst
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.240]   public health crisis in a century, our thoughts are with those affected by COVID-19.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.640]   The seemingly relentless spread of the novel coronavirus has made 2020 a tragic and surreal
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.120]   year, but we remain hopeful and confident in the abilities of our industry to develop
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.640]   the therapies necessary to extinguish this virulent disease.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.960]   I again want to especially thank our team for their work and dedication to our mission
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.520]   developing first-in-class medicines to approve the lives of patients with immunological diseases
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.560]   whose conditions are not being adequately treated by the current standard of care.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.640]   From our perspective, the key pipeline development to the second quarter was our Type C meeting
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.480]   with the FDA, which charted the remaining clinical pathway to an NDA submission for topical
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.640]   ocular reproxylap in dry eye disease.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.940]   The meeting culminated in an agreement to use levels of reactive aldehyde species or
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.200]   rasp, the therapeutic target for reproxylap, as an objective sign-in point for subsequent
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   clinical evaluation.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.000]   In the fourth quarter of this year, we plan to initiate clinical testing to assess the
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.080]   activity of topical ocular reproxylap in reducing care levels of rasp and other objective signs
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.800]   of dry eye disease, and we expect preliminary results by the end of the year.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.020]   The timing of the clinical trial is, of course, subject to finalization of trial-designed
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:39.040]   rasp assay development and potential disruptions due to COVID-19.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.560]   One of a safety study in dry eye disease patients is also planned for the fourth quarter, and
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.000]   NDA submission is expected by the end of 2021.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.320]   Our optimism for the use of rasp as an objective sign of dry eye disease is supported by data
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.640]   from our successful Phase 2A trial, in which reproxylap treatment diminished levels of
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.000]   rasp and tears as measured by ELISA following 28 days of treatment.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.880]   For the upcoming rasp trials, the longest duration of dosing under consideration is also 28 days,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.920]   whereas the shortest dosing duration is 1 to 2 days.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.280]   Additionally, the upcoming rasp trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:34.240]   effect of acute changes in dryness on rasp and other signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.240]   We'll be sharing additional details of the protocol following rasp assay validation
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.320]   and FDA requirement, and look forward to providing trial designs shortly.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.840]   From a safety perspective, topical ocular reproxylap already has been evaluated in more than 1,000
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.040]   million patients with no observed safety concerns.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.320]   In short, the safety, consistency, and clinically significant activity of reproxylap across numerous
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.680]   clinical trials suggests that reproxylap could be an important addition to the limited
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.200]   number of therapeutic options for dry eye disease, which affects more than 30 million
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.320]   patients in the United States.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.080]   Following at other ocular programs in our pipeline, top line results from the phase 3
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.880]   and Vigorate allergen chamber trial of reproxylap and allergic conjunctivitis are expected in
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.520]   the first half of 2021.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.840]   In the retinal disease area in the second quarter of this year, the European Commission granted
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.160]   orphan medicinal product designation to ADX 2191 for the treatment of retinal detachment,
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.400]   providing a new market opportunity for ADX 2191, and the European Union, as drugs receiving
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.480]   the orphan medicinal product designation, are eligible to protocol assistance, research
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.400]   funding, and, upon approval, 10 years of EU market exclusivity.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.880]   ADX 2191, our novel and proprietary intravitrial methotrexate injection, is being evaluated
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.440]   in the phase 3 guard trial for proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.960]   PVR is a rare, but site-threatening condition and a leading cause of failure of retinal
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.200]   detachment surgery, affecting roughly 4,000 patients per year in the United States and
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.760]   nearly twice as many in Europe and Japan combined.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.680]   Given the nature of PVR and given the clinical site delays caused by COVID-19, the progress
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   of guard has been slow, although we expect to provide you with an update by the end of
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   this year.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.240]   As many of you know, there is no approved therapy for PVR, and ADX 2191 has received orphan
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.920]   drug and fast-track designations from the FDA.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:05.080]   ADX 2191 is also the subject of our new clinical program in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.800]   or PVRL, a rare, aggressive, high-grade cancer that affects approximately 2,900 people in
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.680]   the United States with about 600 new cases diagnosed annually.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.400]   There are no approved treatments for the disease, although the standard of care is pharmacy-compounded
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.680]   methotrexate that has been injected into the eye.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:35.920]   We have recently filed for orphan drug designation for ADX 2191 in PVRL.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:42.280]   Turning to our systemic disease program, we are very excited about ADX 629, which to our
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.520]   knowledge is the first systemically available rasp inhibitor, the clinical testing of which
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:55.920]   represents the first time systemic rasp inhibition has been assessed clinically, marking an exciting
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.080]   new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism of action.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:07.920]   An IND has been filed with the FDA for Phase II clinical testing of ADX 629 in patients
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:15.440]   with COVID-19 in order to prevent cytokine release syndrome and respiratory compromise.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.960]   Clinical development is expected to begin this year.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.600]   In an animal model of cytokine storm, ADX 629 demonstrated a broad and highly statistically
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.580]   significant reduction in cytokine levels, including TNF alpha interferon gamma and IL-17,
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.960]   while upregulating the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.360]   The data suggests that rasp inhibitors have the potential to represent immunological switches,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:53.840]   which may modulate immune systems from pro-inflammatory states to anti-inflammatory states.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.400]   In the fourth quarter of this year, we also expect to initiate clinical trials of ADX
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:06.120]   629 in psoriasis and autoimmune disease and atopic asthma and allergic disease.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.040]   In combination, trials in COVID-19, psoriasis and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.680]   and the results of the trials will characterize the immune-modulating activity of ADX 629
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.880]   and rasp inhibition more generally.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:32.760]   Switching to ADX 1612, our novel HSP90 inhibitor, enrollment has been completed in the investigator-sponsored
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.640]   Phase II Udario trial in ovarian cancer.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:44.800]   Regarding the ADX 1612 COVID-19 program, consistent with FDA feedback, additional preclinical
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:53.040]   antiviral testing of ADX 1612 against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will be performed
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.360]   by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has accepted our request to
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.120]   evaluate ADX 1612 and in vivo models.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:12.960]   We plan to update on the ADX 1612 COVID program by the end of 2020.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.120]   We approach the midpoint of the third quarter in a strong financial position, enhancing our
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.360]   flexibility with recent common stock sales to two healthcare-focused funds, Perceptive
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.600]   Advisors and Advidity Partners.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.680]   These transactions raised gross proceeds of approximately $19.5 million completing our
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.120]   previously announced at-the-market offering program.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:45.160]   We expect our cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations through 2022, including
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:52.960]   potential reproxilap approval in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:59.880]   Now with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Josh for the financial review.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.400]   Thanks, Todd.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:09.240]   For the quarter-ended June 30, 2020, we reported a net loss of $7.5 million compared with a
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:15.960]   net loss of $13.3 million for the quarter-ended June 30, 2019.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:22.480]   Net loss per share was $0.25 for the quarter-ended June 30, 2020, compared with $0.49 for the
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.560]   same period in 2019.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.400]   Losses have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research and development programs
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.960]   as well as from general and administrative expenses.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.760]   Research and development expenses were $4.9 million for the quarter-ended June 30, 2020,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.120]   compared with $10.7 million for the same period in 2019.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.560]   The decrease of $5.8 million is primarily related to a reduction in clinical and preclinical
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.640]   development, manufacturing, and personnel costs.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:02.240]   General and administrative expenses were $2.2 million for the quarter-ended June 30, 2020,
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.680]   compared with $3.1 million for the same period in 2019.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:13.420]   The decrease of $900,000 is due to lower personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.440]   and other miscellaneous administrative costs.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.480]   In the second quarter of 2020, total operating expenses were $7.1 million compared with total
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:30.440]   operating expenses of $13.7 million for the same period in 2019.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:38.840]   As of June 30, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $66.2 million.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   Subsequent to June 30, 2020, $25.2 million in cash was received from at-the-market offering
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   program sales to perceptive advisors, validity partners, and other investors.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:59.240]   Based on current operating plans, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:06.440]   of June 30, 2020, plus the additional at-the-market offering program proceeds are expected to be
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.280]   sufficient to fund operations through the end of 2022, including potential NDA approvals
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.880]   for reproxal app in dry disease and allergic conjunctivitis, assuming positive clinical
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:24.160]   trial results and planned NDA submissions, acceptances, and approvals.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.000]   Youth of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are also expected to include the
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.220]   continuation of Part 1 of the Phase III Guard trial in PVR and Phase II clinical testing
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:42.200]   of ADX629 in orally administered RAS inhibitor in inflammatory diseases.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:48.880]   Now I'll turn the call back to Todd for closing comments.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.520]   Thanks, Josh.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:58.080]   We have a number of milestones planned for the second half of 2020, and look forward to
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:04.540]   executing on our clinical development strategy across our ocular and systemic programs.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.560]   Looking at our IR calendar next week, we'll be presenting at the BTIG Virtual Biotechnology
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.480]   Conference and WEDBUSH PACRO Virtual Healthcare Conference.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.180]   These events will be webcast.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.520]   Please check the events and presentation section of our website for details.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.200]   We always look forward to meeting with investors and hope to connect with you at these or other
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.880]   upcoming events.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.080]   As always, we remain committed to executing efficiently in our strategic plan and bringing
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.440]   to market novel therapies that improve the lives of patients with serious unmet medical
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.440]   needs.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.320]   With that, Josh, Dave, and I will be happy to take your questions.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.320]   Operator?
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.880]   At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then be number one on your
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.080]   telephone keypad.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.360]   That is star one to ask a question.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.600]   Our first question comes from the line of Louise Fen with Cantor.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.280]   Hi, thanks for taking my questions here.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.240]   So first question I have for you is, could you get into more detail on significant the
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.880]   FDA's recognition of RAS as a sign for dry eye disease is and what that means for you
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.360]   in terms of potential approval and market opportunity.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.640]   And then the second question I have for you is on your COVID trials.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.720]   How adaptive are those trials in light of the constantly evolving landscape for the treatment
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.640]   of COVID and then how has enrollment gone?
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.880]   And then my last question here is you noted that there's been some headwinds to clinical
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.160]   trial progression due to COVID.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.080]   Can you give more color on which trials may be impacted here?
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   Thank you.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.160]   Good morning Louise and thanks for your excellent questions.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:47.920]   The RAS development is a truly transformative for Aldera.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:56.160]   RAS is the pharmaceutical target upon which the company was founded many years ago.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:05.520]   To our knowledge, no company has ever therapeutically addressed RAS and yet RAS represents a very
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.640]   broad based anti-inflammatory approach that probably applies to many, many diseases, not
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.880]   only ocular diseases such as dry eye disease but also systemic diseases.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:24.520]   So for all those reasons we were thrilled about the FDA's decision to classify RAS as
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:32.120]   an objective sign of dry eye disease which as you know is an inflammatory condition.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:39.440]   What it means practically for the company is that the ongoing clinical trial, the clinical
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.520]   trials that are about to start regarding the assessment of RAS should be likely to work
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:52.800]   based on the fact that the mechanism for proxylapin or other RAS inhibitors is the direct inhibition
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.920]   of RAS.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.840]   These compounds bind covalently to RAS so what we're really measuring is a chemical reaction
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:08.400]   in vivo and in this case in the tear fluid of patients that have been administered with
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.280]   proxylapin.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   In all that leads us to believe that we'll be in a position to file an NDA for dry disease
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.680]   next year as we have previously announced.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:31.080]   Regarding the COVID trial design, we anticipate for both programs enrolling approximately 30
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   patients.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.440]   I think they'll likely be a 2-1 randomization drug to placebo.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   At this point we have not included adaptive designs.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:47.440]   I think the nature of the results of these first trials will help us determine subsequent
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:53.000]   clinical testing which is obviously going to be much more significant if there are positive
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.720]   results from the preliminary outputs that we have here.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   Enrollment hasn't started.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.440]   The IND has been filed for 629.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:12.120]   As I mentioned on the call today, 1612 is the subject of further in vivo investigation
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:20.080]   COVID that is being performed by NIAAD and we're absolutely thrilled about NIAAD's decision
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:26.680]   to test ADX1612 on our behalf.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:32.400]   The COVID impact, as you mentioned Louise across the industry has been significant.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:40.840]   The one trial in our case in our pipeline that has been affected by COVID-19 as the guard
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.840]   trial, the phase 3 guard trial for PBR.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:53.880]   What seemed to have happened during the peak of COVID cases back in March, April, May and
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.760]   so forth was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:10.280]   Despite vision changes, despite losing sight, the number of patients coming in was diminished
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:17.520]   during that timeframe and furthermore, many clinical sites as you know simply did not have
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:23.600]   research staff which were considered for a while to be non-essential such that it was
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:29.560]   difficult if not impossible in some cases to enroll patients.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:36.240]   However, the good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline, we do not seem to be overtly
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.880]   affected by COVID in terms of enrollment.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:48.280]   The dry eye program was largely under discussion with the FDA during the peak number of cases
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.880]   in the spring.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:56.720]   The allergy program, the phase 3 allergy program was on a planned hold because of pollen.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.800]   As you know, you cannot enroll allergy programs with ambient pollen and we expect the invigorate
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.560]   program to re-initiate again in the fall.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.680]   So we were quite fortunate in terms of timing with regard to our other clinical programs
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.200]   we relative to the impact of COVID.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.440]   Okay, thank you.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:24.760]   As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then the number
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.080]   one on your telephone keypad, that is star one to ask a question.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.880]   Your next question comes from the line of Justin Kim with Oppenheimer and Company.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.160]   Hi, good morning guys, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.360]   I know it's early days but you know as you think about establishing a proxies left action
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.360]   on RAST as a sign of dry eye, we've had some discussion with investors on what would be
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.240]   an appropriate duration of observation to discuss this activity.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.120]   Can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the acute versus four week time points
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.080]   from a trial perspective, disease perspective and labeling perspective?
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:06.680]   Right, good morning Justin and good to hear from you.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:13.420]   As I highlighted in my comments this morning, the potential range of dosing duration for
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:20.400]   the RAST trials is anywhere from one to two days on the acute end to 28 days on the more
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.560]   chronic or sub chronic end which reflects the phase two A trial.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.680]   That is the data in our corporate decks showing that after 28 days of administration of a
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:34.760]   proxies left, there was a highly statistically significant reduction in RAST levels as measured
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.760]   by ELISA.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:42.800]   I want to spend a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure RAST.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.760]   RAST exists in our body in two forms, so-called free RAST that are sort of floating around
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.200]   and then RAST that are bound to proteins.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:59.280]   The ELISA measures RAST bound to proteins and as you know ELISA is an antibody mediated
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.400]   detection assay.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:07.720]   The reason why we are able to generate antibodies to bound RAST is that when RAST bind to proteins
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:15.760]   they are antigen and form antibodies in some cases antibodies against self proteins.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:22.120]   The ELISA measures bound RAST and bound RAST generally accumulate over time which is why
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:27.880]   in the phase two A study over 28 days we use the ELISA to assess RAST levels.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:34.600]   On the other end of the spectrum, regarding one to two day or acute dosing of reproxylab,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:41.720]   we think that techniques such as LC and Mast spec might be more relevant to assessing RAST
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.960]   because there we would be looking at free RAST levels that would change acutely following
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   dosing.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:57.280]   Somewhere within those two ranges of dosing paradigms and those two different assay techniques
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:06.520]   we will end up validating the precise technique and then establishing protocol design for the
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.240]   first of the RAST studies to begin shortly.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.560]   Okay, great, got it.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:18.480]   Maybe then how do you think about dosing regimens to be investigated and have you had conversations
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:25.800]   with the FDA on whether you would have to do QID or BID just to appreciate that you would
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:31.080]   be tapering in the disease state eventually?
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.640]   Right, and that gets back to the first part of your question.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:42.880]   How might the clinical community perceive duration of dosing and dosing regimens?
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:51.600]   First of all, I think that signs of diseases, including dry eye disease, are primarily or
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.080]   first and foremost regulatory milestones.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.040]   I do not believe, certainly in the case of dry eye disease, that either physicians or
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.000]   patients are particularly worried about signs.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.160]   Patients do not wake up in the morning thinking, "I wonder what my Schurmer test is.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.000]   I wonder what my corneal stain is," and so forth.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.840]   Instead, we view signs, and I think most patients and physicians use signs as regulatory milestones.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:29.840]   The dosing paradigm for trials associated purely with signs I think is a lot less important.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:38.960]   In this case, for one to two-day dosing paradigm, you are thinking of a limited number of doses.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:45.400]   For the 28-day dosing paradigm, I would expect we would dose QID, which is the first phase
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:51.120]   of our induction maintenance dosing paradigm, which was established with the release of the
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.480]   Phase 3 Renew trial back in December.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.960]   In terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm for reproxelap in general, in terms
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.360]   of treating patients, I think that the induction maintenance paradigm established with Renew
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:17.040]   over 12 weeks really sets the tone, and more precisely, the label for how the drug will
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:24.520]   be used, and that is a QID dosing initially followed by BID dosing for the maintenance
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   phase.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.880]   Okay, that's really helpful.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.320]   Maybe just a clarification question, I know in the press release it says that there's
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:39.120]   going to be a dry NDA filing by the end of next year.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.520]   Is the current thinking still to continue onward with the concurrent filing?
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.780]   I know later it says that AC is also going to be filed.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:51.480]   Just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect them together still.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:57.120]   Our current thinking is that both will be filed together, pending positive clinical data,
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.120]   of course.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:04.560]   It turns out that the timelines for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis continue
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   to overlap.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:14.200]   The safety studies, the efficacy studies, the timeline for filing the NDA, all of those
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:22.480]   seem to overlap for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point, which suggests that a concurrent
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.960]   NDA is perhaps the best regulatory strategy, but of course we'll have to see how events
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.720]   play out over the latter part of this year and the early part of next year before we
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.040]   can guide specifically on the possibility of a concurrent NDA.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.840]   We really do like the concurrent NDA paradigm, however, because of the overlap between dry
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.920]   eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.920]   There seems to be about a 50% overlap such that about half of the patients with dry eye
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.960]   disease complain of ocular itching, and about half the patients with allergic conjunctivitis
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:05.000]   complain of dryness, and a single compound that could treat both diseases or is indicated
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.920]   for both diseases would be highly advantageous, not only to physicians, but also to patients
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   as well.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   Right.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   Great.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   Essentially, just on the safety study, is there an expectation for what the size and scope
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.720]   duration as well as number of patients you would anticipate for it?
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.720]   Right.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:36.320]   For dry eye disease, my current understanding is that the FDA generally requires 100 patients
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:48.080]   complete one year of dosing, however, based on other sponsors' interactions with the agency,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:54.400]   we believe that we can file based on six months of safety data.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:00.200]   What happens is most sponsors will over enroll, they'll begin with more than 100 patients such
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:11.720]   that they have 100 completers at 12 months, and to our knowledge, the safety trials are
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.680]   fairly standard in dry eye disease.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:24.400]   I will say as I mentioned in my prepared comments that we've tested well over 1,000 patients,
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:32.760]   we have seen no safety signals, no changes in intraocular pressure, no retinal findings,
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:39.840]   no aberrant corneal findings, or any other safety signals that would suggest that there
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:45.760]   has been an issue with reproxilep dosing in any patient that's received drugs so far.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.760]   Great.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   Great.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.760]   Thanks again, and I'll hop back in the queue.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.760]   Yep.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.760]   Thanks, Josh.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.760]   Again, there are no further questions at this time, and we'll turn the call back over to
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.360]   Dr. Brady for closing remarks.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.880]   Well, thank you all again for joining us today.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:08.320]   As always, we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   Have a nice day.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   Thank you.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.320]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.320]   That does conclude today's conference call.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.960]   We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Good morning, and welcome to Earthstone Energy's second quarter 2020 conference call.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   please press star zero on your telephone keypad.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Joining us today from Earthstone are Robert Anderson,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Lumpkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and Scott Thielander, Vice President of Finance.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Mr. Thielander, you may begin.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Thank you and welcome to our second quarter conference call.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and Section 21(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Although management believes these statements are based on reasonable expectations,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   they can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   as described in the earnings announcement we released yesterday,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and in our 2019 annual report on Form 10(k) and subsequent quarterly filings.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   These documents can be found in the investor section of our website, www.earthstoneenergy.com.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Should one or more of these risks materialize,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   This conference call also includes references to certain non-GAF financial measures,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   which include adjusted diluted shares, adjusted EBITDAX, adjusted net income,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   all-in cash costs, cash GNA, and pre-cash flow.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Reconciliations of these non-GAF financial measures to the most directly comparable measure under GAF
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   are contained in our earnings announcement released yesterday.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Also, please note, information on this call speaks only as of today, August 6, 2020.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Thus, any time sensitive information may no longer be accurate
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   at the time of any replay or transcript reading.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   A replay of today's call will be available via webcast
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   by going to the investor section of Earthstone's website and also by telephone replay.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You can find information about how to access those on our earnings announcement release yesterday.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Today's call will begin with comments from Robert Anderson, our CEO,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   followed by remarks from our CFO, Mark Lumpkin,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   regarding financial measures and financial matters in performance,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   and then some closing comments from Robert.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I'll now turn the call over to Robert.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and appreciate everyone's attendance for our call today.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Thanks for making time to join us for our second quarter conference call.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   In the midst of the current pandemic,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   we continue to take appropriate caution and maintain focus on keeping our personnel safe
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   while continuing to efficiently manage our operations.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Achieving our strong second quarter results in the face of this unprecedented oil price collapse
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and difficult operating environment is evidence of the resiliency of our business plan
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and the solid commitment of our people.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Throughout these trying times, we have worked to quickly adjust to the rapidly changing conditions
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   and align our costs with our business activity as well as preserve our strengths.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   As we have discussed last quarter and in updates along the way,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   stating we would be free cash flow positive from the second quarter on for 2020,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   we had significant free cash flow of $35 million in this quarter.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   This was driven by several factors including limited capital expenditures in the quarter
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   as we completed our drilling and completion program for the year,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   strong hedge position that delivered over $29 million of realizations,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   and significantly lower operating costs,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   partially as a result of our May shut-in and containment program,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   but also sustainable reductions.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Including the impact of our shut-in program,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   our average daily sales volume in the second quarter was $13,555 barrels of oil equivalent,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   or BOE, per day.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Even with reduced volumes and a 44% drop in average realized price per BOE in the second quarter,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   our cost management efforts combined with the strong hedge position
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   allowed us to generate higher quarter over quarter adjusted net income and adjusted EBITACs.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   We expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the balance of the year,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   which should result in a decreasing debt balance
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and help us achieve our target of being below one times debt to EBITACs for the year.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   As we previously discussed in response to the sharp decline in oil prices in April
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   and very low forecasted May oil prices,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   we made the decision in late April to shut in the large majority of our operated production
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   for the month of May,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   which resulted in approximately 60% of our total net production being shut in during May.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   With a forecast of significantly improved June oil prices,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   which ultimately were more than double our April and May oil price realizations,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   we returned to full production in June.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   We had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   which saw us reduce total lease operating expense, or LOE,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   in the second quarter by 40% from the prior quarter.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Despite reduced production volumes due to our shut in program in May,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   our teams continued focused on cost reductions,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   resulted in a 30% decrease in LOE per BOE in the second quarter
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   to $4.53 versus $6.51 cents in the first quarter.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   This was the major driver of the overall 33% reduction in all-in cash costs during the quarter.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   On a per-unit basis,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   our all-in cash costs went from near $13 per BOE in the first quarter
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   to near $10 per BOE in the second quarter
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   for a total 22% reduction.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   This is all-in cash costs, folks,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   which includes operating costs, corporate G&A costs,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   and all of our interest costs on our debt.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   To dive a little deeper into how we achieved the 40% decrease in LOE,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   let me outline some of the key factors.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   First, as much of our peers have done,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   we were successful in negotiating price reductions with vendors
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   across the broad range of our lease operating expenses,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   from chemicals to maintenance rigs,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   saltwater disposal contracts, and compression costs.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Second, we are benefiting from our long-term practice
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   of spending a little more money as we go repairing wells, facilities,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   and associated equipment to reduce frequency of maintenance,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   which is resulting in a continued decrease in non-routine LOE repair needs.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Third, workover repairs have trended down,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   resulting from our optimization of lift method,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   chemical program improvements,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and general approach of fixing things right the first time.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   The limited offset frack activity also reduced frack hit-related workover expenses.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Fourth, we have been successful in getting the utility companies
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   to perform electrical upgrades sooner than scheduled,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   which has allowed us to eliminate generator usage on some of our newer locations.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Lastly, with limited drilling and completion activity,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   we have also been able to refocus our field employees towards lease maintenance,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   All of these items and many other subtleties of operating
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   were in progress as our team has a history of continually driving down costs.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   We will remain focused on continuing to reduce costs across the board
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   as we expect the oil price environment that we have observed since late 2014,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   including increased volatility to persist,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   which only stresses the need to structure our business
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   to be profitable across a much lower oil price range.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I'd really like to commend our operations team,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   which did a fantastic job of both shutting in production in May
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   and bringing production back fully online in June,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   while also achieving these cost reductions.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   For the first time in my career and our team's history,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   we had to tell our guys to produce as little as possible every single day.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   We executed this shut-in operations,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and our field personnel did a great job of efficiently returning wells to production
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   with little to no incremental expense and no adverse effects on our producers.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Our wells have returned to their previous volumes,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   with some wells producing at increased rates for a period of time.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Plus, the three wells in Southeast Reagan County that were brought online in April
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   prior to the curtailment, and were shut in during May,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   are now back online and have fully cleaned up and are performing well versus the tide curve.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in late May
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and released our contracted rig operating in the Midland Basin.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   So our planned capital expenditures are minimal for the balance of the year,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   given that our program ended with 11 wells drilled but not completed,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   and with our ample liquidity, we have optionality on completion timing
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   depending on market conditions.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   With production return to full capacity,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   we have entered the second half of this year with expectations
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   for no further drilling or completion activity this year.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   We can maintain approximately flat year-over-year production in 2020 compared to 2019.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   As a reminder, we recently updated our 2020 full-year production guidance,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   ranging from 13,000 to 14,000 BOE per day,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   which compares to 2019 full-year average of 13,429 BOE per day.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Further, with our 11 drilled but uncompleted wells in Upton County,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   we intend to carefully monitor commodity pricing, appropriate service availability,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and service cost conditions to determine if it makes sense to bring in a completion crew
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   later this year or wait until early next year.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Depending on the timing, we anticipate the completion of those 11 wells
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   would enable us to maintain similar year-over-year production for 2021,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   with only a modest capital program for the completions,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   which we currently estimate at around $30 million.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   With that overview, I'll now turn the call over to Mark to review the financials.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Have at it, Mark.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Thank you, Robert.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   As we have in the past two consecutive quarters,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I'd like to first discuss our cash position and our balance sheet.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   As Robert mentioned, we are pleased to have achieved our goal
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   of generating substantial free cash flow in the quarter
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   with a total of $35.1 million of free cash flow.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   As we referenced in our first quarter call,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   our plan was first to reduce our working capital deficit,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   which we calculate excluding derivatives,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and we're able to do this by a little over $50 million during the second quarter
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   and then to begin to pay down our revolver debt.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   The barn, based under our senior security revolving facility,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   which was set in late March, remains unchanged at $275 million
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   and should remain there until our regularly scheduled fall
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   redetermination process.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at quarter end
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   hold $168.6 million, and we had $1.8 million in cash.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   With $106.4 million of unused borrowing capacity,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   that gave us approximately $108 million of liquidity quarter end.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I would note that as of July 31st, we had paid down our revolver
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   by $14.3 million compared to quarter end,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   reducing our debt balance now to about $154.3 million,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   and we do expect to apply free cash flow the remainder of the year,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   primarily to pay down the revolver.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   During the second quarter, our capital expenditures
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   settled $3.2 million, and year to date,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   we have spent $45 million of our annual 2020 capital budget
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   of $50 to $60 million.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   As Robert mentioned, we concluded our 2020 drilling program in May,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   so we anticipate minimal expenditures during the remainder of the year,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   and will likely end up toward the low end of our guidance range.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Now looking at our second quarter income statement,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   starting with the top line, revenues for the second quarter of 2020
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   were $21.7 million compared to $45.1 million in the first quarter.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   The decline was driven by a 54% decrease in oil revenues
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   to $18.9 million, which made up about 87% of total revenues,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   and the NGL revenues fell by 44%,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   while natural gas revenues rose slightly.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Our average price in the second quarter for all three commodities
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   was $17.56 per barrel of oil equivalent,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   which was down by nearly half of our average price during the first quarter.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   By commodity, our average mileage price for crude oil in the second quarter
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   was $23.56 per barrel.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Natural gas at average $0.83 per MCF,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   and NGLs average $8.10 per barrel of oil equivalent.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   From a production standpoint, our second quarter sales volumes
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   averaged $13,555 barrels of oil equivalent per day,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   which was comprised of 65% oil, 18% natural gas,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and 17% natural gas liquids.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   As highlighted, this does include having curtailed about 60% of total production in May.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   On the expense side, as Robert also highlighted,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   we did drive down our all impact costs from $12.92 per BOE in the first quarter
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   to $10.11 per BOE in the second quarter.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   We achieved this through nearly $2 per BOE reduction,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   our least operating expense, to $4.52 per BOE for the quarter.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   On the general administrative side,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   we reduced our absolute cash GNA expense by about 7% versus the first quarter,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   which resulted in per unit cash GNA expense of $3.34 per BOE.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   As you know, we reduced our cash GNA guidance in May to $15.5 to $16.5 million
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   for the full year, and expect to be somewhere in that range,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   which at the bottom end is a 25% reduction versus our initial full year plan.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   In addition to some of the savings we articulated last quarter,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   we continue to focus on and have had success in reducing expenses
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   really any and everywhere, including reduced uses of third party consultants,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   reducing vendor rates, and managing our costs tightly.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   From an income standpoint, we reported GAT net loss in the second quarter
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   of $35.9 million, or $0.55 per share,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   which included a pre-taxed, unrealized loss of $50 million on our derivative contracts.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Our adjusted net income was $12.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   adjustable diluted share for the second quarter.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   We reported adjusted EBITACs of $39.8 million in the second quarter,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   which as Robert mentioned, is actually an increased quarter of a quarter.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Now let's take a minute to update you on our commodity hedge results in the second quarter.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   As highlighted, we realized $29.4 million are gained on our commodity hedges for the quarter.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   This is largely reflective of our hedge position entering the quarter,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   and are locking in some really nice gains on hedges
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   when we made the decision to Grichell production,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   and did that when second quarter NIMAC prices were about up to the lowest point.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   The hedge realizations also include a gain of about $5.7 million
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   from an unwind of 1,000 barrels of oil a day for the second half of 2020.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   We remain really well ahead for the balance of the year
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   with an average of 6,500 barrels per day of oil swapped at a NIMAC price of $58.35,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   stepping down to 4,000 barrels a day for four year 2021
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   at a NIMAC price of $55.16 per barrel,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   with basis hedges in place on similar volumes.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   On the natural gas side, we have 7,000 MMBTUs per day
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   of swaps at a Henry Hub price of $2.85 for the second half of this year,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   stepping up to 8,000 MMBTUs per day at a price of $2.71 for four year 2021
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   with basis hedges in place on the same volumes.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Hedges remain a critical component of our financial strategy,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   and we expect to continue layering on hedges as we get more visibility
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   around the resumption of our drooling and completion activity going forward.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Coming back and looking at our expectations for full year 2020,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   we reinstated our production guidance in July,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   and we've reinstated LOE in production and Avalorum tax guidance
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   with our earnings released yesterday.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Our reinstated production Avalorum tax guidance of 6.25% to 7.25%
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   is identical to what it was at the onset of our 2020 guidance provided in January,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   as is the case for our reinstated LOE guidance of $5.50 to $6 for BOE.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Although we have had recent sustainable LOE reductions
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   and came in well below this range in the second quarter,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   without the advantage of bringing on new wells,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   we have kept our guidance range where it was at the beginning of the year
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   when we anticipated bringing 16 new wells online.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   With that, I'll turn it back over to Robert.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Thank you, Mark. We are really pleased with the results and confident
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   in a bright future for Earthstone.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   While we are sorry to see our industry in such distress,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   it is creating more M&A opportunities than we have seen in quite some time.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   We are actively evaluating a number of situations
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   and expect to have more to consider throughout the rest of the year
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   as prices remain low and distress situations continue to increase.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   We believe that our strong balance sheet and track record as a successful consolidator
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   positions us well to increase the scale of our company
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   and add value to our shareholders.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   With that operator, we'll now open the floor for questions.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   If you'd like to ask a question, please press Start 1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   You may press Start 2 if you'd like to remove your question from the queue.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   For participants using speaker equipment,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Our first question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Hi, morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I guess on the 2021 color that you gave about being able to keep production flat
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   with the 11 ducks, is that more just meant to be instructive
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   or is that actually how you're thinking about the 2021 plan as we fit here today?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Yes. A little bit of both, Brad.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   You know, it does depend on where commodity prices head towards the end of the year,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   whether we want to pick up a rig or not.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I think we've been pretty vocal or consistent about our message that, you know,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   we need mid-45 to $50 oil to want to go back to spending large capital dollars.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   But outside of that, at some point into this year, early next year,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   completing those wells will allow us to main production flat year over year.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Okay, good. And then obviously you made a comment on M&A.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Can you go into a little more detail about sort of what opportunities you're seeing
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   and also any thoughts you have about an ability to fund them?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Opportunities are increasing and size is variable from small to quite large
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   as you've seen, you know, distressed and bankrupt companies.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I think all of this will result in further opportunities
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   in terms of larger companies selling assets.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   It is difficult with no public equity and, for that matter, debt markets open
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   or open only to a very few. Maybe we're one of those few.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   But we've had discussions with financial parties who are interested
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   in participating with us on acquisitions.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And much like we've done in our history, you know,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   we'll bring in parties at the right time to look at buying assets.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And we're going to maintain a very healthy leverage amount
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   and keep ourselves from getting into a distress no matter where we are in the cycle.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   So I think we're just going to see more and more opportunities
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   and we'll figure out how we can finance those
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   and make sure we keep our balance sheet clean.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Okay. Thanks for the comments.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Dingman
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   with Truist Security. Please proceed with your question.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Morning all. Robert, first question also on that same line on 21 Expectations.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   I was just wondering, you know, why I realized this plan really,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   I think, you know, at least the one you just initial laid out assumes no new wells.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Really, what I'm just wondering, what's driving this low cost
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   or another way to maybe ask is how you think about maintenance CAPEX,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   you know, given just so low because, you know, if I recall,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I thought Frank already had you all cancel all those Country Club and other memberships.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   I just know what else is there.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Yes, there's no Country Club memberships up here.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   You know, I mean, the 11 wells we have are in really good areas
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and they will help us keep production relatively flat at $30 million.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Now, is that sustainable? Absolutely not.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You know, we still have a relatively high decline rate
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and it does depend on when we brought those wells online.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   If we wait until the very end of '21, we're going to have a hard time
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   keeping production relatively flat.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   If we brought them on today, you know, we might have the same problem
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   because we get all this flush production from these new wells.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   So, you know, maintenance, to maintain, you know, 13,000 BOE a day kind of level longer term,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   we're going to have to have a rig running and one rig program.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   I don't know what it would exactly cost us today,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   but generally speaking is $120 million to maybe $140 million
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   depending on lateral length and working interest and things like that.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   So, you know, this is just a very preliminary.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   If the world stays the same and we're at a low $40 environment
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and we're not spending any drilling capital,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   these 11 ducks will help us keep production flat.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Okay, and then you kind of hit on my last one.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Just on how do you think about sort of PDP decline, you know, on a go forward?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   It is now that you've been slowing a bit, is that too, you know, going to go down
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   or I guess we'll get another way?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Is it, you know, are you able to give us kind of how many wells would offset that?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I mean, in any way, you can kind of give us a caller
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   on how, you know, kind of you're thinking about that in 21 on broader terms.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Yeah, I think we've been consistent in telling everyone
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   that our sort of basic line starting today, we'll call it, you know,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   is about 30% in the first year and then it gets into the mid to maybe 26
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   or 27% the next year and then low 20s or high teens after that.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And so, you know, I don't think that's changed any
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   and if we didn't spend any capital then you can kind of forecast
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   what our blow down production would look like even if we didn't do those 11 wells.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   But again, with those 11 wells, it'll help keep 21 flat and then going forward
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   in 22 and beyond.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It's all going to depend on price.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Very good.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Thanks, Chris.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Thank you.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Our next question comes from line of Jeff Graf
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   with Northland Capital Markets.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Thank you guys.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I was wondering, Robert, or maybe from Mark,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   how important do you guys do you think precast flow positive in the context of evaluating,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   you know, whether to go after this deduction and potentially drilling
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   or I guess some point in time?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Would you view that as kind of a, you know, a must if you will
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   or would you guys have any level of comfort with any, you know, near medium term
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   outstand if it helps, you know, if the returns were good and it would help start a return to growth?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Sure.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Maybe I'll try to answer that one then Robert can add on if he wants to.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   You know, we keep things pretty simple.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   At the end of the day, we feel like our responsibility is to make good individual
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   decisions at the wellhead.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And that's why we were quick to put the rig down and stop completing in March and April
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   is because the economics didn't make a whole lot of sense then.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Do the ducks make sense right now?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   I mean economically you definitely could go complete the ducks right now
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   and have pretty nice IRRs for the incremental cost to complete them.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   In terms of are we so focused on quarter to quarter, year to year precast flow
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   that we won't outspend?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   No, we're not.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And from a practical matter, and we're just going to be precast flow positive this year
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   and next year kind of irrespective of anything else that happens with prices
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   if all we're doing is completing the ducks.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   At some point, you know, we do anticipate picking the rig back up and, you know,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   there's a bit of obviously a lag there between the cost you expend
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   to drill in the complete wells versus the cash flow.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   You know, does that mean over the course of the year we're not precast flow positive?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   No, not necessarily, but we're not so fixated on checking that box every quarter.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   We want to make smart economic decisions of the wellhead
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   that will flow into the bigger picture.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And having some outspend for some period of time,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   you know, we still think it's supported by the economics.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   At the same time, you know, we're not ones just to go keep drilling and completing
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   because we have hedges in place or for other reasons.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   We're just trying to get as serious as we can of the individual decisions
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   we're making at the wellhead.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Yeah, the only thing I'll add, Jeff, is I think we can run a one rig program
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   with the level of production and cash flow we have today
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and be cash flow neutral on an annualized basis.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Obviously, there's a jump starting the program.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   We're going to be cash flow negative for a period of time,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   but I think longer term over a year timeframe.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Again, depending on what the price is.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Sure, understood. Appreciate those comments.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And my follow up, and you guys still have, you know,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   a decent amount of nonoff exposure in the Permian.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Are you guys seeing any activity levels there and more on the land side?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Is there any traction or conversations on swapping any of that out
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   to increase the operation exposure there?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Still working on the trades, but people have been hunkered down in the bunker,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   you know, for quite some time now since, you know, at least March.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And so nothing's moving very quickly there.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   We have no, we have not heard anything different from our partners
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   in terms of activity in the near term being kind of the remainder this year.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   So we'll have to see as we get closer to year end what their view might be
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   for activity in 2021.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   All right. Thanks, Ed.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Duncan McIntosh
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   with Johnson Wright. Please receive your question.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Good morning, Robert.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Good morning. Check.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Had a quick question overall on the balance sheet.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   You know, y'all are doing a great job in the free cash.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   I look great paying it down.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Wondering, you know, have you been in conversations with the bank
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   as we head into the fall redetermination back in March?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   You know, we're early in getting it done in the spring,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   but, you know, back then it looked like things would be pretty dire
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   getting in the fall, and it's not as bad here,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   and particularly with the line of sight y'all have on the free cash,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   kind of how -- any conversation with them to give you any indication
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   as to what the fall redetermination could look like.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Sure. I mean, probably too early to, you know,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   sort of anything around numbers,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   but we do pretty rarely talk to banks
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   and we do that normal course irrespective of the environment.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   You know, the one thing I can -- for us,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   we are expecting a decrease in the baron base,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   and, you know, obviously we're not drilling
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   and completing new wells and hedges roll off.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   You know, fortunately, we feel like we've got enough ability
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   to pay down debt to outpace that decrease,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   and really, you know, we don't see any scenarios
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   that we think are realistic
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   that would be concerning in that regard.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Now, I will say, like, does the environment feel better now
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   than it did three months ago? Absolutely.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   And maybe some of that's the shock of seeing
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   minus 37-dollar oil and, you know,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   seeing realizations for the months of April and May.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   At the end of the day,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   it's still not a very good price environment
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   for companies in general,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   and the banks, maybe they feel a little better
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   because we're at $45 or $42 versus somewhere in the teens,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   but they still have a lot of issues to deal with,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   and obviously there's been a lot of E&P companies
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   that have gone bankrupt,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   certainly more that will.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   So the banks still have their hands full,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   and they're still working through all these situations.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Yeah, I think there is a lot of trepidation
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   in the banks' part in general,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   and, yeah, I don't frankly see them letting up
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   a whole bunch in the fall.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   No, that being said, that's a general statement.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Yeah, we've got one-time leverage and liquidity
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   and generally are viewed as having done the right thing
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   from a financial standpoint,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   and our assets are better than many.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   We probably feel like we've got a pretty supportive bank group
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   that is going to be reasonable and fair,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   and historically that's been the case,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   but too early to circle a number.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   Thanks, Mark.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And then, I guess just for my follow-up,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Robert, you gave some really good color
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   and added some pretty creative things to get LOE down
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   in the second quarter.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I know you talked about how it's going to come back up
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   a little bit here in the back half of the year
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   towards a more historical range,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   but any of those initiatives that you took,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   do you think that you can carry forward
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   to kind of help mitigate that LOE creep?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Definitely done.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   It's just a constant progression
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   of a well's life cycle to adjust artificial lift.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   A lot of our wells are on gas lift,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   so relatively expensive compressors.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Over time, that gets changed out to other lift methods.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   In some cases, rod pump,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   in other cases, plunger lift, what have you.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   So we're continuing to work through that,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   and that will definitely help reduce LOE.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And then some of the things that, you know,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   we're fortunate in getting done in the quarter
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   working with the utility company to get meters set
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   and get ahead of the schedule there
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   or got moved up in the schedule from some good relationships.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   We ended up getting generators off of our payroll,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   and those are very, very expensive.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   So we didn't have a whole lot,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   but they still show up as a big expense.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   So some of these things we did in the second quarter
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   are sustainable, and we'll continue doing the right things
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   in the way we, you know, operate our business
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   and continue to watch costs like a hawk.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   All right. Thank you all very much.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And congratulations to Strong Order and Strong Outlook.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Thanks, Doug.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   if you'd like to join the question queue,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   please press star one on your telephone keypad.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Our next question comes from a line of Noel Parks
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   with Cocor and Palmer.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Hey, good morning.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I know.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   You know, I was thinking about having the buck inventory
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   that, you know, where it works out that just completing those
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   next year can help you keep production flat.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   That's, you know, that's a lot of really great flexibility
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   you have there.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   And I mean, was that just sort of a result
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   of the timing of everything, you know,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   kind of falling off the rails with COVID and Ulrich Russia?
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Or was that sort of part of the plan
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   as you were just trying to, you know,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   continue the pivot to emphasis on free cash flow
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   hitting it next year?
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I'd love to tell you Noel that we have this great plan
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   that no matter what happens in the world,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   oil going to 20 or sub 20,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   that we could keep production flat for three years running
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   with various amounts of capital.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   If you go back and think about the beginning of the year
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   and the call we had, you know,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   related to the fourth quarter earnings in full year,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   we had a one rig program.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   We were going to average for the entire year
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   a tiny bit of free cash flow.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   And those 11 wells would have been completed.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I don't know if by now I can't remember,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   but pretty darn close.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   So I'd say it's a fallout of what's happened here
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   and just being very conservative
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   with our capital expenditures and cash
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   and making sure that, you know,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   we come out of this down this near term down cycle.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   We've been in a down cycle since 2014,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   but at least this recent piece of it that we, you know,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   we survived nicely through it and come out the other side
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and continue to find ways to consolidate and grow.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Great. Thanks.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   And you're just a housekeeping question.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   So if you touched on this earlier and I missed it.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   For the free cash flow calculation,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   if I looked at the numbers, right, it looked like this is one
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   of those periods where there is a pretty big delta between,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I guess you'd say cash capex and, you know,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   sort of capex incurred in the quarter.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And I was just wondering for the free cash flow calculation
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   going forward, which one of those is more important
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   for us to use as we, you know, just try to model that?
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   We always use accrued cash from a calculation standpoint
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   because not all the bills necessarily have hit,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   but we know what generally they are.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   So, okay, it's in the presentation on the last page
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   or something like that.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Okay. So real -- oh, and one other thing,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I am -- and I just don't have a release in front of me.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And as far as change in working capital,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   that's something also you would routinely include --
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   well, include the impact of in a free cash calculation
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   or would you exclude that?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Yeah. So we don't include that.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And I recognize there's, you know, multiple different ways
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   to look at that.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   I mean, the way we've been approaching it is, okay,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   the cost at EBITAC is the best proxy
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   for a really sort of cash flow for the period.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   We back out interest expense,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   and then we back out capital expenditures
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   for activity during that period.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Now, when your stopping or starting,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   there is going to be a bigger delta
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   between calculating free cash flow the way we do
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   versus if you're using a cash cap X number.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   You know, the second quarter was very atypical
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   to the standpoint of, you know,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   here we're reporting $35 million of free cash flow.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Yeah, our debt balance went up.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And the reason for that is because --
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   and of course this is tied to the cash cap X.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   It's just the time of the payments.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   You know, we reduced the negative working capital deficit
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   by about $50 million during the quarter.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Now we're to a point where that working capital deficit
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   is pretty low and probably won't fluctuate
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   a whole bunch one way or the other
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   until we pick activity back up,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   at which point you'd expect, you know,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   as you start completions and drilling again,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   you start getting bills, but there's some lag
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   between the activity and when you get the bills
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   and when you pay them.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   So very typical quarter.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Yeah, as we mentioned, the press release,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   you know, we had about $169 million of debt at quarter end.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   And the month of July, we paid down a little more than 14.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   That's not the run rate, by the way.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   It's not 14 million a quarter.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   That was high because of timing.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   But we do expect, I mean, really every month this year
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   that we're paying down some debt without any big changes
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   in the working capital status.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Great. Thanks a lot for the details.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   That's not for me.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Thank you.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   that concludes our question and answer session.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Anderson
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   for any final comments.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Well, we appreciate everybody joining us.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And, you know, we'll continue to update as we need to.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   And we'll see you next quarter.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Thanks.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Thank you.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   This concludes today's conference.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   You may disconnect your lines at this time.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Thank you for your participation.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Thank you.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   Good day and welcome to the Ferns 2nd Quarter 2020 Financial Results and Corporate Update
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.400]   Conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder today's
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.720]   conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce you, your host for today's conference,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.840]   Alexander Fujisius, Head of Investor Relations at Ferns. Please go ahead.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.720]   Thank you, Charlotte. I'd like to welcome and thank you all for joining us today for
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.520]   Affirmate's 2nd Quarter 2020 Financial Results and Operational Progress Conference call.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.880]   Before we begin, I would like to encourage everyone to go to the Investor Relations section
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.680]   of Affirmate's website to find the earnings release and related financial tables. We also
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.760]   post this slide on our website that follow our discussion today. On the call today we
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.840]   are joined by Drs. Adi Hurst, our Chief Executive Officer, Andreas Hartstrich, Chief Medical Officer,
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.520]   Arn Stathilius, Chief Scientific Officer, and Angus Smith, our new Chief Financial Officer
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.160]   who joined us in July. We are also joined by Dr. Wolfgang Fischer, our Chief Operating Officer,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.240]   and Ms. Denise Muller, Chief Business Officer. They will also be available for the Q&A session.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.000]   Before we start, I will quickly go through the Safe Harbour Statement. Today's discussion
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.600]   contains projections and forward-looking statements regarding future events. These statements
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.560]   represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this call. Except as required
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.440]   by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly or to
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.600]   update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.240]   the forward-looking statement, even if new information becomes available in the future.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.240]   These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, and actual results
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.560]   may differ materially from those expressed or implied in this statement due to various
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.960]   factors, including but not limited to those identified under the section entitled risk
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.800]   factors and are filed through the SEC and those identified under the section entitled
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.760]   forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued today and filed with the SEC.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.360]   With that, I will turn the call over to Adi. Adi?
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.440]   Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our second quarter
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   business update call. Today we have some updates to share with you on our operational progress
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.760]   as well as on our financial results. While we're still in the middle of a serious
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.000]   global health pandemic and a challenging economic downturn and aftermath, we're quite confident
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.680]   that the steps we're taking in advancing our science and moving our pipeline forward are
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.000]   beginning to yield data that demonstrate the long-term potential of our innovative approaches
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.040]   and products. COVID-19 continues to affect societies around
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.240]   the world, and we hope that you and your families are well and safe. We are observing some impact
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.560]   by COVID-19 on the progress of our clinical studies, however, it's at last time we're
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.640]   taking great efforts to minimize them. As a result, we have been able to continue our progress
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.560]   on the clinical studies of AFM-13 in peripheral T-cell lymphoma and of AFM-24 in each AFR
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:54.080]   positive tumors, which is very exciting for us. Genetic dose, the first patient with RO7297089,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.160]   which, as you remember, is the BCMA CT-16A inertial engagement. We're also making good
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.200]   progress on our preclinical pipeline. For our lead candidate AFM-13, our study in patients
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.440]   who have relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in exhausted available standard
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.120]   of care treatments are now being treated with AFM-13 as a single agent. We are executing
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.560]   according to our development timelines and, as previously stated, expect to complete the
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:35.720]   pre-determined interim analysis in mid-2021. We're also looking at options to enhance AFM-13's
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.560]   efficacy beyond monotherapy. The first of these options is the combination with allergenic
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:51.160]   and K-cells in a study that is conducted at the MD Anderson Cancer Institute and on IST.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.960]   MD Anderson website now shows that the study is enrolling, but the initiation is impacted
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.280]   by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Texas. A first patient in the study is expected as
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.480]   soon as this situation improves. For AFM-24, we disclosed that we have completed the first
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:18.800]   COVID of our dose escalation study without any dose limiting toxicity. And we're currently
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.880]   recruiting into the second dose COVID. We have all four planned sites active and recruiting.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.120]   Following the completion of the dose escalation phase of the study, we have the option to
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.600]   enroll patients into tumor-specific expansion cohorts where we will look for single agent
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.360]   activity in a number of well-defined tumor types. In addition, we're planning to initiate
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.520]   combination studies with checkpoint inhibitors. And we will be providing updates as the program
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.360]   continues to make progress. We're very pleased with the continued progress in our collaboration
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.620]   with GenNTIC. Importantly, the phase one clinical study with the BCMA CT-16A inertial engager
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:10.400]   is now enrolling patients. This achievement represents the third inertial engager to enter
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.280]   the clinic and trigger some milestone payment to us during the third quarter in an amount
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.680]   that we're not able to disclose. Last month, Angus Smith joined us as chief financial officer.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.240]   Angus will introduce himself later and discuss our financial position and the flexibility
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.520]   provides us to continue to execute on our strategy and drive future growth of our company.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.800]   During the annual meeting of shareholders, which was held in August 4th, we're happy
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.240]   to report that all proposed agenda items were approved. This includes the addition of Dr.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.520]   Annalisa Jenkins and Harry Welton to the supervisory board as new members. Annalisa is a visionary
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.320]   leader who knows how to translate signs from bench to bedside. And Harry is an accomplished
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.000]   financial executive who will help drive value creating strategies for the company. These
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.040]   additions to the supervisory board further strengthen the company's industry know how
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:22.160]   to experience diversity. As it has only been a month and a half since we last spoke to
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.640]   you, we thought we would focus today's discussion on company achievements thus far and what
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.340]   gives us confidence in our science. Update you on our programs and allow plenty of time
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:38.520]   for Q&A. To get it, I will now hand over the call to Andreas Horstreich, our chief medical
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:45.000]   officer, to give you a brief update on our clinical stage programs. Andreas?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.920]   Yeah. Thank you, Adi, for the introduction. And thank you all for joining us today. And
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.240]   I'm happy to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs that we made over
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:07.560]   the last three months. As you all aware, COVID-19 pandemic is still present globally
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.440]   and it continues to pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:21.000]   of patients. The two guiding principles we are employing at AFIMED is to ensure patient
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.440]   safety on the studies and to ensure trial data integrity. And this is in line, I think,
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:34.920]   with our guidance given from all competent authorities. Within this framework, however,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:41.600]   the AFIMED team is very proactively working with all of our participating sites to make
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:50.040]   sure that our innovative treatment is still available for patients in need of new therapeutics
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:58.120]   and that we minimize the impact of COVID-19 to a minimum possible. One important achievement
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:04.320]   in this regard is that we were able to secure drug supply for all of our ongoing studies
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.840]   and can ensure uninterrupted treatment of all patients. To go into more detail, let's
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:20.040]   start with AFM 13, our most advanced program first. As you know, AFM 13 is in a registration
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:28.720]   directed phase two study, AFM 13202, treating patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:38.480]   T cell lymphomas who have exhausted all available standard of care options. The enrollment into
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:46.840]   this study is at a steady state. We were able to activate 54 sites now contributing patients
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:56.920]   in 10 countries around the globe. As you know, this study has Simon II stage designed with
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:06.320]   a pre-planned interim analysis after 40 patients in the PTCL cohorts. As Adi said, we are confident
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:13.960]   that we will have the data from this interim analysis available by the middle of next year.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.680]   There was also a third cohort or there is a third cohort in this study for patients with
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:26.960]   transformed mucosas fungoides, so a cutaneous form of T cell lymphomas. This third cohort
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.640]   with mucosas fungoides was never part and never intended to be part of the registration
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:40.120]   program. It was a proof of concept cohort only. And for COVID-19 related restrictions,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:47.360]   the enrollment into this cohort is currently on hold. As Adi also mentioned, we are continuing
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.520]   to make progress in our collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center, where we have an
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   active IND for our first phase one study of AFM13 in combination with allergenic national
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:10.720]   killer cells. As Adi said, the current status at the MD Anderson webpage is recruiting.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.160]   And we know that patients are currently screened and considered. And we are expecting to -- the
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:23.040]   enrollment of the first patient as soon as COVID-19 related restrictions at MD Anderson
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.880]   are lift up.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:34.560]   Now let's move to our second program, AFM24. As you know, by specific tetravalent molecule
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:42.000]   targeting both CD16A to activate national killer cells and macrophages and the EGF receptor
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:52.400]   on solid tumors. This compound is in phase one dose escalation part of the 101 study.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.960]   And we are happy to report that we were able to activate all four pre-planned sites and
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.680]   all four pre-planned sites are contributing patients. As we disclosed earlier, we have
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:10.960]   completed cohort one without observing dose limiting toxicities and are actively recruiting
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:17.160]   into dose cohort 2.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:24.040]   With this, I close the overview of the clinical progress. And I'm happy to hand over to my
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:30.280]   colleague, Arne Chotilios, chief scientific officer, who will review with you some of our
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:37.200]   preclinical data that make us so excited about the opportunities that we can create for patients
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   with ICEs and activating the innate immune system. Arne, please.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:51.880]   Thank you, Andreas. And thank you all for joining. In the next few minutes, I would like to summarize,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:57.040]   as Andreas mentioned, the preclinical and clinical data observed so far with our innate
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:05.640]   cell engagers, providing evidence that these molecules are potent and safe drug candidates.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:13.880]   I'll start by summarizing the data showing that our ICEs are potent molecules. As you
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:22.760]   see on slide five, if we take AFM13 as an example, AFM13 has been shown strong single
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:31.640]   agent anti-tumor responses and T cell informa with a normal response rate of 50%. The molecule
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:38.560]   has also shown promising signs of broad clinical development potential in augmenting other IO
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:46.320]   therapies, such as PD1 inhibitors. For example, in the Hodgkin lymphoma phase 1B study, we've
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:53.240]   seen an impressive overall response rate of 88% with a complete response rate of 42%
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:01.920]   and 46% in the local and the central read, respectively. In the low part of the slide,
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:10.880]   we've also highlighted for you presentations of the study's past and in the future. Additionally,
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:17.800]   our own experience and the work with Andy Anderson, we have seen promising preclinical
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:24.400]   data showing that the combination with the adoptive transfer of NK cells enhanced the
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:32.000]   immune response of AFM13, leading to prolonged survival in the respective mouse model. As
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.040]   we mentioned, the phase 1B study, Dan D'Anderson, is now in the last stages of preparation.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:49.080]   If we go to slide 6, you see that in our preclinical studies with AFM24, we saw potent killing
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:57.480]   of EGFR positive tumor cell lines mediated by two distinctive mechanisms of action. Potent
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:05.840]   ADCC or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity is seen irrespective of the imitational status
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:14.640]   of the tumor cells. And we see potent killing mediated by ADCP or antibody dependent cellular
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:22.560]   phagocytosis in tumor cells with high and low EGFR expression. Importantly, in cells
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:32.400]   bearing the KRAS G13D mutation, AFM24 shows preserved killing, potent killing, or ADCP
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:42.040]   or phagocytosis, whereas this ability is lost for established treatments. For the anti-BCMA
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:53.880]   CD16 or RO729, formerly known as AFM26 molecule, we also saw very good potency in synomunkies,
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:16:03.760]   whereas a dose dependent killing of BCMA positive plasma cells was observed. We believe that
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:11.040]   the observed improved potency is mediated by the dual mode of action of our approach.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:17.320]   The innate cell engagers are employing NK cells and macrophages to kill tumor cells and
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:25.160]   thus act via a two prong mode of action of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:33.360]   antibody dependent phagocytosis to fight cancer. Indeed, this dual mode of action is differentiated
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:42.360]   from other innate cell targeted approaches as these specifically activate NK cells only.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:49.600]   Our innate cell engagers work at low expression levels. The potency is thus independent of
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:58.720]   the surface target expression. And you see this in Continuum Slide 6. With AFM13, we learned
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.960]   that there is a broad range of cell lines that express different levels of tumor antigen
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:11.800]   and we have not observed any dependency of target expression to the potency of the molecule.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:19.880]   The same holds true for AFM24 and the anti-BCMA engagers. Preclinically, both molecules have
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:28.200]   shown high potency across a wide range of EGFR and BCMA surface expression, including
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:36.080]   at low target expression levels. This implies that more patients could respond to treatment
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:44.760]   with an innate cell engager versus an antibody drug conjugate or ADC as the mechanism of ADCs
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.800]   have been shown only to rely on certain levels of target antigen, thereby missing those tumor
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:18:00.520]   cells with expression levels below the ability of the ADC to bind to target cells.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:07.600]   As we move on to Slide 7, and report on the safety front, preclinically, our innate cell
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:15.560]   engagers demonstrate low cytokine release. Some examples of this are the IND enabling
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:21.760]   toxicology study in synomologous monkeys which consistently showed no meaningful increases
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:29.320]   in serum cytokines. For example, at the June virtual ACR conference, a preclinical poster
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:37.240]   presentation on the RO729 molecule with Genentech showed potent cell killing in tumor cell lines
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:44.080]   employing NK cells as effector cells with minimal increase in cytokines. Also, a four-week
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.920]   safety study in synomonkeys showed a favorable safety profile with no cytokine release or
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:19:00.360]   adverse findings at the 1515 and 5050 mixed per kick tested dose levels. And in the case
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:09.240]   of AFN24, only a transient increase in RO6 was observed that was fully reversible within
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.680]   24 hours, but no signs of cytokine release was observed that would lead one to believe
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:23.000]   that there is a risk of a cytokine storm in patients. Important to note here is that none
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.960]   of the clinical studies of AFN13 have revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:39.440]   These data indicate that our ICs have a tolerable and good safety profile. Taken all together,
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:45.640]   these data suggest that our innate cell engagers are potent, able to engage at low levels of
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:53.680]   antigen expression, and have thus far demonstrated a good and tolerable safety profile. Now in
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:20:01.200]   order to maximize the opportunity for molecules, in addition to clinical development as monotherapies,
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.240]   we're also pursuing combinations with natural killer cells and other treatments such as
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:13.880]   checkpoint inhibitors such as PD1 and PDL1. We go to slide eight and first let me comment
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:20.600]   on our combination approach with NK cells. As you see on the slide, there is evidence
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   showing that high NK cell numbers are associated with better outcomes. For example, patients
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:35.000]   with metastatic, coutaneous melanoma have improved survival rates if their tumors show evidence
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.480]   of NK cell infiltration. We also know that patients with diffuse large B cell and follicular
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:51.960]   lymphomas treated with NDCD20 antibodies that have low peripheral NK counts tend to have
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:59.840]   poor survival. We're seeing that one of the limitations in treating patients is that they
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   don't have the appropriate amount of NK cells. So we're working on supplementing NK cells
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:15.240]   through adaptive transfer and are currently assessing different approaches as you can see
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:24.160]   on slide nine. As we go to slide 10 and as discussed earlier, the improved tumor cell
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:31.840]   killing by loading NK cells with our ICEs, as you see on the graph for in vitro data
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.440]   on the right hand side of slide 10, it will be investigated in the MD Anderson phase one
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:45.560]   study in CD30 positive recurrent or refractory Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:51.360]   preclinical data that we share here and have shared before leads us to believe that we
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:59.760]   can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy of innate cell engager AFM13 through the addition
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:10.240]   of NK cells. And encouraged by the synergistic potential of combining our ICEs with NK cells
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.400]   and checkpoint inhibitors, we're currently evaluating the opportunity on our developing
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:23.880]   clinical plans for these combinations with AFM24. Finally, let me just briefly summarize
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:31.120]   the recent posters presented at ASCR. As a reminder, our AFM24 poster demonstrated its
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:39.120]   distinct mechanism of action different from other EGFR signaling inhibition approaches
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:46.600]   potentially able to provide benefit to a broad range of cancer patients. And in the case
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:55.280]   of the joint poster with Genetic, the preclinical pharmacology and safety of the BCMA CD60A innate
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:01.200]   cell engager shows potent cell killing in tumor cell lines, employing NK cells as effector
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:09.400]   cells, minimal increase in cytokines, suggesting a low risk of cytokine release syndrome.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.280]   We hope this background was helpful for you. And I will now turn the call over to Angus
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.240]   to introduce himself and provide an update on the financials. Angus.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:27.000]   Thank you, Angus. Thank you, Angus. Before I discuss our financial highlights, let me
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.920]   just say that I am thrilled to have joined after that. And I look forward to working with
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:38.280]   our talented team to deliver on the problems of our exciting cytokines.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.800]   Turning to the results for the quarter, AFMED's consolidated financial statements have been
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.720]   prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:55.520]   for IASB. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the company's
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:01.640]   functional and presentation currency. Therefore, all financial numbers that I will present
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:07.160]   in this call unless otherwise noted will be in Euros.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:14.120]   We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and current financial assets
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:20.480]   of 92.6 million Euros compared to 104.1 million Euros on December 31st, 2019.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.040]   During the quarter, we received net proceeds of approximately 20.8 million Euros under
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:32.000]   our asset market for ATM program. Based on our current operating plan and assumptions,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.400]   we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents, and current financial assets will support
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:43.720]   operations into the first half of 2022. Net cash used in operating activities for
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:50.120]   the quarter ended June 30th, 2020 with 15 million Euros compared to 5.6 million Euros
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:56.720]   in the second quarter of 2019. The second quarter 2019 net cash used in operating activities
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:03.400]   included a milestone payment to the company from the Genentech Collaboration.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.340]   Total revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was 2.9 million Euros compared with 4 million
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:14.880]   Euros in the second quarter of 2019. Revenue in 2020 and 2019 predominantly relate to the
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.600]   Genentech Collaboration. Revenue from the Genentech Collaboration in the second quarter
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.280]   2020 was comprised of revenue recognized for collaborative research services performed
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:32.560]   during the quarter. R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 11.7 million Euros compared
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:39.240]   to 11.5 million Euros in the second quarter of 2019. Expenses in 2020 relate predominantly
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:45.160]   to our AFM-13 and AFM-24 clinical programs as well as to our early stage development
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:51.760]   and discovery activities. G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 2.6 million
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:58.680]   Euros compared to 2.3 million Euros in the second quarter of 2019. The increase is primarily
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:05.160]   related to higher SOX compliance costs, legal consulting and audit costs. Net loss for the
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:12.840]   second quarter of 2020 was 12.2 million Euros or 16 cents per common share of 10.3 million
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:19.200]   Euros or 17 cents per common share during the second quarter of 2019. The weighted number
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:25.960]   of common shares outstanding for the quarter ended June 30th 2020 were 79.2 million.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.520]   I will now turn the call back to Adi. Adi?
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:39.280]   Thank you Angus. As you can see from our presentation today, we're taking advantage of the knowledge
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:46.160]   that we've gained in the field of innate immunity and are applying it to our programs
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.640]   going forward. This experience in working with the innate
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:57.440]   immune system is something that we have uniquely established at AFMAD and is helping us in
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:04.320]   guiding the design of unique therapies which now have the potential to address very different
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:12.400]   kinds of cancers. I just want to point out here that the EGFR is expressed in more than
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:23.280]   10 tumors and that gives us a lot of optionality how to take this molecule forward. We're pleased
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.560]   with how things are moving forward for both our clinical and preclinical programs especially
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:34.280]   in the current environment. Our preclinical programs are in track AFM 13
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:40.440]   and 24 are moving forward according to plan and Gen Antic is moving things forward with
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:48.040]   the anti-PCMA CD-68 inertial engagement. What are our inflection points for the next
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:55.920]   one and a half years for AFM 13? We've mentioned that we want to present the interim data
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:03.520]   in peripheral T cell lymphoma around middle of next year.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.920]   We've been successful in our collaboration with MD Anderson moving forward the combination
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:18.080]   of AFM 13 and co-plug derived natural killer cells. As we said we're ready to start and
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.680]   MD Anderson is ready to start and we hope to report first patient in and we will provide
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:31.360]   update as we move forward. For AFM 24 we're in the midst of those escalation
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:38.200]   in order to generate safety and activity data. This is quite exciting for us because it's
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:46.520]   drug with a very differentiated profile as compared to the other moieties currently used
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:53.320]   in targeting EGF receptor. Now with the dose escalation and establishing
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:59.640]   the safety we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:05.200]   do the dose cohort expansion but as we've mentioned earlier as well as planning early
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:12.400]   on to move forward into combinations. We're very happy with the progress in the
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   Genentech collaboration. We've just provided the next update for the BCMA CD16-A in-gager
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:25.560]   we have multiple other programs ongoing and if things go well pending on program progression
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:32.480]   we can bring in additional milestone. And for our newest additions to the pipeline
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:42.340]   with AFM 28 and AFM 32 we are starting the IND enabling studies so that we can have an
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:48.360]   IND filing first for AFM 28. Finally before we open the session for Q&A
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:54.320]   I would like to thank all our employees for their contribution and express our gratitude
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:30:00.360]   and my gratitude in particular for our investigators and the clinical sites, the patients and all
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:06.600]   their families and our investors who are supporting us in our efforts to develop these innovative
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.880]   treatments for cancer patients. It is through the combined efforts of all
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:19.400]   of you that keeps us on the path of discovery and innovation. I'm now happy to close the
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.000]   presentation and we're open now for questions. Thank you.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.800]   Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. As a reminder
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.080]   if you wish to ask a question you will need to press star and the number one on the telephone
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.920]   and we will need to get an answer. If you wish to cancel it you can press the pound
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:42.540]   or hash key. Once again it's star and one for questions.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.480]   First question comes from the line of Maui Rakhoff from Jeffery so please go ahead.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:52.680]   Your line is now open. Hi good morning everyone that's under progress
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:31:00.160]   and thanks for taking my questions. To start off just wondering for AFM 24 I'm not sure
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.560]   how much you can say on this but just wondering if both patients in core 2 have been dozed
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:12.320]   and if you can talk more about the timing of dosing between patients and what the foresight
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.200]   activated can you provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward?
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:23.400]   Andreas can you take the question please? Yeah so there were multiple parts to the
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:32.400]   questions I hope I got them all. So the phase one study of AFM 24 as we said we are recruiting
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:40.440]   in the second cohort. We have not yet disclosed how many patients as you know it's a standard
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:51.520]   3x3 design with a Bayesian dose modification but that's basically what it is.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:57.960]   In terms of timing between the patients there is a mandatory eight day waiting period between
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:03.840]   patients so they cannot be treated all at the same time but will be staggered with eight
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:11.440]   day intervals. And there was another part of the question around the four participating
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:18.360]   sites. Right yeah just wondering if you can provide any more perspective about enrollment
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:26.160]   pace going forward. Yeah currently the enrollment pace is as pre-spressified by the protocol
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:32.960]   so all sites are very active in screening patients and as we said all sites have already
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:43.420]   contributed patients. Got it okay great and then also for AFM 24 just checking if you
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:48.720]   can say more about the tumor types that you're screening for the study and if you can also
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:56.600]   provide more perspective into the checkpoint inhibitor and combo plans at this point.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:07.200]   So for the tumor types in the dose escalation part we are accepting all patients with or
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:14.840]   all histologies that are EJFR expressing and where the patient has exhausted the respective
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:21.780]   standard of care treatments. As Adi mentioned this is a wide variety of potential tumors
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:28.080]   are probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal cancer and non small saline
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:35.120]   cancer and these are the two histologies where we would expect probably the majority of patients
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:42.120]   in the phase one having said that the dose escalation part would but also be open for
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:49.680]   other EJFR expressing tumors like for example head and neck cancer gastric cancer or other
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:57.240]   solid tumors. Now once we have defined our dose limiting toxicities or if there are no
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:05.240]   dose limiting toxicities we have defined recommended phase two dose we will enroll into tumor specific
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:13.760]   expansion cohorts and these expansion cohorts are currently in the process of being defined.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:22.760]   Now for our PD1 combination plans based on the interesting data we have seen with PD1
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:30.320]   in combination with AFM 13 which aren't referred to with a very encouraging complete response
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:41.000]   rate in excess of 40%. We plan to have a combination with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor open rather soon
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.920]   probably in parallel to the last cohorts of the dose escalation of the single agent study
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:54.400]   so it will be more or less a parallel development that we are anticipating right now.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:13.560]   Great. Okay thanks for the additional perspective. Any follow-up questions? Okay we will now proceed
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:20.480]   to the next question. Next question comes from the line of Jim Bertchenkopf from Wells Fargo.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:27.360]   Please go ahead Jim. Hi guys congrats on all the progress. Maybe just a first quick question
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:33.880]   for Angus to start him off. Collaborative research revenues is that expected to be
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:39.200]   a stable number between the three to four million dollar level or is there any reason
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:45.440]   that might go up as programs progress and as we think about the milestone that got paid
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:50.920]   in the third quarter is it a simple matter to back out the assumptions around collaborative
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.040]   research revenues and that will give us some sense of the milestone given that you can't
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:02.680]   say it explicitly. Yeah thanks Jim for the question. So you know our revenue numbers fluctuate
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.640]   from quarter to quarter you know based primarily on the number of hours that we are working
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:13.120]   on the various Genentech programs that are in progress. I mean you can see just looking
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:19.080]   back at the last several quarters we've been you know fairly range bound and call it the
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:24.600]   two million to five million zone you know when you see increases it's typically a result
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.720]   of point in time milestone payments that we receive. So you know this milestone payment
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:36.520]   that we discussed today that we'll get in the third quarter will likely increase our
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:41.120]   revenues in the third quarter and that would be sort of an add-on to the range you've seen
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.280]   over the last several quarters of that again kind of two to five million dollars two to
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:53.840]   five million euros rather. Got it. Okay that's helpful and then maybe just on cohort one
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:00.560]   for AFM 24 and what we might learn from that cohort can you remind us if you're doing pre
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:06.280]   and post biopsies and what kind of translational work you might be doing and you know how that
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:15.080]   might inform you know the ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site? Yeah so in
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:25.920]   the dose escalation part we do a pre treatment biopsy post or on treatment biopsies are optional.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:33.200]   We do have a significant correlative science program looking at peripheral activation markers
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:41.920]   of NK cells as well as on cytokine profiles. Once we are in the expansion phase so we are
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:47.600]   recruiting into tumor specific cohorts. I think this is the part where we will get most
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:53.480]   of the correlative science as we have a more homogeneous patient population. We maintain
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:38:00.640]   our requirement for a pre treatment biopsy and we'll have post or on treatment biopsies
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:07.600]   in selected cohorts. And then just you know given the comments
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:18.480]   on the variability in peripheral NK cell populations is there any sense in screening patients for
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:25.560]   their NK cell levels given that you know patients who screen low may not have adequate NK cells
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:32.360]   or macrophages to recruit or you feel like within the variability of innate cell in the
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.480]   blood that you'll be able to have an effective treatment and it's not worth screening for
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:42.560]   that variable. I think currently it would be premature
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.760]   to you know depends on what you mean with screening. So we are definitely determining
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:55.040]   the levels of circulating NK cells and also looking at some of their characteristics.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:03.960]   I think we currently do not have enough data to define a cutoff or a threshold and this
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:11.200]   may very well vary between tumor histologies and also be dependent on the infiltration
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:19.160]   of NK cells in the tumor microenvironment. Variable which we have seen in our AFM Columbia
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:27.360]   study to have some impact on the likelihood to respond to patients. So think in the beginning
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:34.880]   of the program we will be open for all comers. We will assess all of these important biomarkers
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:40.320]   and then based on the activity data and the readouts that we are seeing we may modify
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.640]   as a program defining certain thresholds but currently I think it would be premature
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:52.920]   to do that. Maybe just a final question. Just the Ambi Anders in collaboration is focused
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:40:00.760]   on core blood derived NK cells. Is there any thought to other NK cell sources including
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:12.480]   potentially IPSC derived NK cells? Adi you want to take this question or should
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:20.840]   I take it? Andreas why don't you go ahead? Okay. You are right. Core blood derived NK
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:31.280]   cells is one source of NK cells and if you watch the field of NK cell based approaches
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:39.000]   especially the field around companies and institutes providing different sources of NK
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.720]   cells there is definitely speed picking up and there is a variety of options to look
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:56.760]   at and this is what we do not only from our side but we have also received proactive inquiries
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:05.520]   of potential working models together so we are looking at the entire NK cell field and
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:12.040]   evaluate various options there. Great. Thanks for taking the question guys.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:18.880]   Maybe as a quick comment so we see this core blood derived NK cells already quite advanced
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:24.320]   in clinical development so there have already been many patients treated while with the IPSC
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   currently there is still a safety to be determined and obviously in combination we will learn
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:40.680]   more on their functionalities. So this is somewhat yet to us on how functional an IPSC
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.440]   derived versus a peripheral NK cell is and it is good to see the first clinical data
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:51.400]   so we are quite not only happy but we have checked so many different options at the moment
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:56.440]   for NK cells and we are indeed very convinced about the activity of the core blood derived
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:07.680]   NK cells from MD Anderson. Great, thanks Adi. Thank you. Our next question comes from the
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.880]   line of ICOG from BMO Capital. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:21.120]   Hey, good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. This is EK Allen for Do Kim.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:27.400]   Thanks a couple regarding the BCMA and the Engager. I understand that you have limited
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:34.840]   visibility on the entirety of the clinical development pathway but if you can provide
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:43.880]   any type of insight in terms of what genetic kind of has planned in terms of could it potentially
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:55.440]   pursue an accelerated pathway for the assets and secondly again you do not provide complete
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.680]   details on the exact milestone payments but if you can provide some additional perspective
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:10.720]   on what the future milestones for the asset might hold in terms of you know phase 2, phase
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.880]   3, things of that sort should we expect increasing size of value for each milestone payments
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:23.640]   that would be helpful for us. Thanks. Adi, maybe I take the question on the pathway
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:31.000]   and then hand over it to you with the milestones. Yes, please go ahead aunt.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.600]   So thanks for the question. I mean as you already correctly say we cannot really speak
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:42.800]   in detail for Genentech but we can share with you I think you're aware of course licensing
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:49.320]   this molecule was a big part of the deal we did with Genentech. They're obviously excited
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:55.720]   about the strong differentiation potential of the molecule also demonstrated at ACR
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:01.440]   at the poster just to review again a very strong preclinical cell killing selective
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:09.880]   noseducan release very good safety profile and good pharmacodynamic marker specific BCMA
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:17.520]   plasma cell killing in the synomunky so you know despite the also recent approvals of
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:26.200]   the you know income first encumbers in the space I would say that Genentech shares our
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:31.200]   excitement with the differentiation potential in a way for a potentially best in class
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:39.360]   molecule maybe I I leave it there I think it's it's a it's a clearly strongly clinically
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:47.480]   validated space and I think this molecule will enable Genentech and we as their partner
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:55.360]   to you know have a strong position in the space. Yeah regarding the financial so I just want
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:04.500]   to recall the deal when it was signed so we received 96 million in upfront cash and I can
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:12.480]   get the total of more than 5 billion in milestones that are in different categories so there
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:18.020]   are a preclinical model there's a preclinical milestone payment there are indeed multiple
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:25.080]   clinical milestone payments regulatory and sales milestones and on top we can receive
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:31.680]   royalties which as we described are on the higher end of what you would expect for the
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:43.800]   early nature of the license agreement beyond that we're able to disclose any further details
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:49.680]   unless Genentech would allow us or rush would allow us to do so usually and that's just
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:58.400]   a general statement is that the payments will increase the further the program progresses.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.840]   Okay thank you for that and just one more quick question I think I might have misheard
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:10.600]   it and this is in regards to AFM 24 I believe you mentioned that there was a patient that
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:18.280]   had increased in our six out of kind levels that would resolve over 24 hours just curious
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:23.920]   was that self resolving or did that patient receive an AL6 inhibitor?
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:30.800]   Yeah I can thanks for bringing that up in the clarification so the transient AL6 increase
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:38.960]   was reported in the INE enabling SINNO TOX study what you you referred to the ACR poster
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:45.440]   indeed we saw that with the dosing a kind of moderate peak that quickly went down was
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:51.560]   completely resolved without any any treatment obviously you know one doesn't do that in
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:56.800]   the because this is SINNO TOX study and again when we see this in the context because it
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.920]   was transient and fully reversed leads us to the conclusion which of course will be
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:10.200]   looked at carefully in patients that we should not expect any kind of cytokine release syndrome.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:19.640]   Okay thank you for that clarification sure thank you next question comes from the line
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:29.840]   of view Jen if I'm made in your company please go ahead the line is now open hello yes hello
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:36.960]   Jen hi can hear you hi sorry that's my headsets follow up thanks for taking the questions
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:46.080]   my first question is that for the AFM 13 in the for the registration study that is assignment
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:56.480]   to set up so what might be the threshold of ORR in the 40 patients and sort of internet
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:02.400]   readout before you can move forward so just curious what any information you can reveal
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:12.440]   on that front I'm afraid we cannot give a concrete response rate it's based also on
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:18.360]   the Bayesian design so there are some interdependence of response rates but we usually do not disclose
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:26.600]   thresholds but it's a classical assignment to stage design okay no problem and also just curious
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:38.400]   in terms of AFM 24 that your dose escalating but at least based on the animal data is any
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:47.320]   thought where when you might start to see the potential effective dose to start I think
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:54.400]   currently it's not possible to predict when we will have the optimal biologically active dose
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:49:02.920]   as there are a number of covariance like binding sites for CD16 binding sites for EGFR and then
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:11.200]   distribution and as you know the animal models especially in terms of pharmacokinetics and
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:20.840]   pharmacodynamics are very difficult to translate the relevant talk species and I've started as
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:28.360]   only a talk species is a synomorgous monkey however we do not have any synomorgous monkey tumor
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:35.040]   models available so we cannot really bridge between what we see in the toxicology studies
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:42.440]   and then what we would see in terms of efficacy for tumors so it will be something that we will
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:51.440]   have to define in our in our clinical program okay great maybe it was taken one last question here
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:50:02.200]   is that in terms of adaptive in case cell from the cobalt of deriving itself first of all could
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:10.440]   that be potentially used in sorted tumor and any comments comments in terms of regarding that
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:22.920]   this is as Adi said something that we are actively looking into we're starting out with lymphomas
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:32.600]   obviously with AFM 13 targeting CD 30 but our vision is that also for AFM 24 we will develop
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:40.960]   certain development options in combination with NK cells could be caught blood derived in case
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:47.360]   health could be NK cells from another source that is something that we will define but the
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:55.680]   intention is also to to have a have a program where AFM 24 would be partnered with exogenous NK
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:02.800]   cells okay great thanks appreciate it and congrats for all the progress this far
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:14.240]   yep no further question at this time for any closing remarks please go ahead speakers
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:24.680]   yeah thank you again for listening in and following our updates the the progress is
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:32.000]   coming smoothly along despite that we are affected by COVID we have strengthened the
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.760]   team significantly in order to address any issues that may relate to the conductance of
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:45.800]   this clinical trials or to the interactions with the with the specific sites so we're
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:52.840]   very happy to be able to have been able to address any of the issues that have been arising and I
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:59.800]   indeed want to thank again the entire team here at AFIMED for managing all that through this
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:07.880]   difficult times we're quite excited that we can move forward these programs either it's
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:14.520]   monotherapies and now looking at the different options of of combination if you've heard
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:20.400]   we focus on natural killer cells and checkpoint inhibitors in particular PD1s or PDO1s so we
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:26.760]   feel that we have with the multiple programs addressing different targets we can provide
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:35.640]   a couple of data over the next quarters and in years and very happy to report any additional
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:40.680]   updates as we move along thanks a lot again for listening in and all the best good point
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:48.600]   thinking this into the conference today thank you all for participating email disconnect stay safe everyone thank you

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.600]   Good morning, and welcome to the third quarter 2020 Pilgrims Pride Earnings Conference call
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.040]   and webcast. All participants will be in listen only mode.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.060]   If you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star keyfile by
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.800]   zero. At the company's request, this call is being
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.760]   recorded. Please note that the slides we found during
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.680]   today's call are available for download from the Investor Relations section of the company's
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.720]   website at www.pilgrims.com. After today's presentation, there will be the opportunity
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.720]   to ask questions. I would like to turn the conference over to
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.240]   Dana Muinoto, Head of Investor Relations for Pilgrims Pride. Please go ahead, sir.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.400]   Good morning, and thank you for joining us today, as we are operating in financial results
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.120]   for the third quarter end of September 27th, 2020.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.960]   Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release providing an overview of our financial performance
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.200]   for the quarter, including a reconciliation of any non-gap measures we may discuss. The
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.600]   copy of the release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website, along with
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.200]   the slides we will reference during this call. These items have also been followed as 8Ks
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.520]   and are available online at www.scc.gov. Presenting to you today are Fabio Sandri, President and
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.160]   Chief Executive Officer and Chief Manager Officer, and Joe Wabuzer, Head of Commodity
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.120]   Risk Management. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone of our
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.000]   safe harbor disclaimer. Today's call contains certain forelooking statements that represent
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.080]   our outlook and current expectations as of the day of this release. Other additional factors
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.680]   not anticipated by management may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.800]   in these forelooking statements. Very information concerning those factors has been provided
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.520]   in today's press release on NK and our regular filings with the SEC. I'd now like to turn
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.920]   the call over to Fabio Sandri.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.760]   Thank you, Dylan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. For the
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.400]   third quarter of 2020, we reported net revenues of $3.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $305
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.720]   million or a 9.9% margin, 18% higher than a year ago, and an adjusted GAP EPS of 66 cents.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.800]   I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our global team for their continuing commitment,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   dedication and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.400]   healthy by maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.440]   time. I could not be more proud of our team as they have continued to come together to
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.080]   support one another, our customers and consumers.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.520]   Faith is a conditional appearance, and our team members responded admirably to the unprecedented
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.560]   conditions supplying products to our customers. We're continuously adapting our global operations
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.920]   to the change in channel demand while adjusting our operations to be able to maintain the
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.480]   operations at all our plans and minimize any significant disruption due to labor and health
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.160]   issues. We remain diligent in implementing precautionary, proactive steps to better safeguard
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   the wellness and help of each team member while fulfilling our spatial duty as a food
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.080]   producer to consumers in every region where we operate.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.000]   We incur direct COVID-19 mitigation costs of roughly $27 million for the quarter and close
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.600]   to 77 million year-to-date. The direct costs are related to the extra cleaning of our production
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.200]   and common areas, the extra PPE and E including masks and face shoes that we are providing
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.240]   to all of our team members and installation of physical barriers in our production areas.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.720]   We also installed dual technology UV and bipolar ionization in every plant to filter the air
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.440]   and neutralize potential viruses. We're offering free light health online services that allow
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.480]   for virtual doctor visits and no cost. And above all CDC guidelines, we remove vulnerable
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.200]   team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.600]   These figures includes indirect costs. There are a lot of indirect costs that are more
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.480]   difficult to precisely quantify such as overall disruptions to our operations, less optimal
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.880]   mix and production efficiencies that are not included in these numbers.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.520]   Also, we are supporting our communities with our home strong initiative. It is an example
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.040]   of how we value the importance role of playing the communities where our team members live
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.280]   and work. We understand the responsibility that comes with being a major employer in rural
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.360]   communities. And we work hard to contribute to the well-being of those communities by
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.120]   not only providing gainful employment opportunities, but also participating in volunteers, donations
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.840]   and sponsorship opportunities. This quarter we accrued $50 million in SGNA for this initiative.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.480]   To the specifics of our business, despite continuing volatility and challenging marketing environments
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.600]   in Q3 and added operating costs, we have continued to generate a superior relative performance
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   to the competition and have remained resilient to market fluctuations. This is a reflection
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   of our portfolio approach, including the strategy on well-diversified products, broad geographical
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   footprints and relentless focus on key customers. For the full quarter, operating performance
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.880]   built in US and Mexico significantly improved sequentially, and Europe also continued to
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.080]   increase despite the challenges due to COVID-19. In Q3, we saw market conditions continue to
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.800]   recover across all of our global operations, with the US and particularly Mexico experiencing
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.640]   the struggle rebounds in performance relative to weak conditions during the first half of
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.400]   the year. We are pleased with the results, especially when taking into account all the
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.560]   disruptions, less than optimal product mix and added operating costs when compared to
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.680]   the environment in 2019. Despite continuing challenges in global market conditions due
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.480]   to COVID-19, our consolidated results have also remained well balanced, and the result
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.520]   of our vision to become the best and most respected company, creating the opportunity
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.040]   of a better future for our team members. To support our vision, we are continuing to
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.280]   implement our strategy of developing a unique portfolio of diverse, complementary business
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.160]   models, continuing to relentlessly pursue operational excellence, becoming a more valid partner
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.120]   with key customers and creating an informed environment for safe people, safe products
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.000]   and healthy attitudes. While market conditions in all our global operations are continuing
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.040]   to improve during the quarter, food service demand globally still has not reached prior
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.640]   levels, and the environments are still quite challenging some sectors where we operate.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.320]   Disruptions from COVID-19 have continued to present a significant challenge on each individual
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.080]   country's demand for protein consumption, as well as for the flow of global trades and
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.920]   generate volatility far beyond normal seasonal factors. We will maintain our strategy while
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.460]   continuing to improve the portfolio to better respond to individual market dynamics and
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.400]   generate a relative increase in performance over our peers. We believe this approach will
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.480]   give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to long run and minimize the full
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.960]   peaks and troughs of the commodity sectors. During the third quarter in the U.S., we are
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.720]   continuing to see demand recovering at our fresh operations, including from some sectors
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.920]   within food service, with more states gradually losing travel and movement restrictions. QSL
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.120]   volume has been especially strong, and demand from our customers has been outperforming
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.160]   the industry. Similar to last quarter, commodity large bird reboning was also again the most
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   challenge during Q3. Operationally, however, we continue to improve our relative performance
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.960]   versus the industry across all business units. We are continuing to adapt to the shipping
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.360]   flow, demand by increasing our volume mix to key customer retailers. In addition, a large
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.800]   portion of our food service customers are also within the QSL segment, which has further
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.120]   dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models. Our portfolio of differentiated
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.400]   products, along with our key customer model, are giving us better insulation against the
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.760]   volatility. We're also much better positioned to adjust products and channel mix, giving
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:41.040]   our presence across all bird sizes from small to large. Within those small birds and case
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.320]   ready segments, market supply and demand was again very well balanced during Q3. Demand
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.160]   from retailers, especially from our key customers, was strong, supporting the improvement performance
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.080]   of our case ready business. Our market leadership in these categories and more differentiated
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.400]   product portfolio have continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive advantage versus
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:07.920]   industry. While we commit to our key customer strategy has been reflected in the consistency
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.480]   for past results, the value of this approach has never been more relevant to our growth
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.560]   than during the current times of great uncertainties and challenges. To further support the growth
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.560]   of key customers, we are doubling our case ready capacity at our plant in Minnesota by
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.720]   increasing the number of heads processed at the plant while also raising the mix of more
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.080]   stable margin case ready products. With this addition, we also expect to increase by 20%
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.940]   our production of our differentiated higher attributes just bear brand products. It is
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.600]   also supported in our conversion of one plant from the commoditized large bird deboning to
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.840]   a key customer QSR in the small bird segment. The strong relationships we have with key customers
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.240]   are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase since these customer rely
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.760]   on us to satisfy their needs for growth. In addition, many of our key customers maintain
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:06.480]   a leadership position in their respective categories. As a result, we are direct beneficiaries
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.480]   of their ability to outgrow their competition. Beyond driving pure growth, our key customer
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:17.400]   strategy also promotes trust, enhances long term relationships and strengthens our margin
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:24.760]   structure. In the US prepare foods business revenue declined 23% on 26% less volume euro
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:31.280]   per year. A large part of this decrease, 70% of the volume was driven by schools remaining
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.760]   close, partially upset by strength in the retail demand. On the other hand, our margin
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   from sales has improved 29% driven by more favorable price and mix. We continue to simplify
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.600]   our portfolio to improve efficiencies and shift resources towards branded growth in the retail
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:56.920]   channel. Our pilgrims brand sales grew 52% and our just bear brand gained a new distribution
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.220]   resulting in dollar share growth in the retail channel.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:07.360]   32 code storage data at the end of August, broiler inventory was up 2% from the close
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.280]   of Q2, but down 1% from the previous year. Like quarter inventories were up 10% compared
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.280]   to last year. This is not surprising considering the mixed simplification due to ongoing labor
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.480]   constraints seen during Q3 and overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.920]   of COVID-19. As some markets reopened and the pipelines are empty, we are seeing some
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.800]   increasing leg quarter sales during October and a reduction in inventories and upward
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:41.520]   movement in prices. US poultry exports including pause were up 4.7% year over year throughout
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:50.880]   August. Roller meat alone was up 3%. In contrast, through Q3 our exports have increased by 14%
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.080]   year over year, outpacing the market. China continues to be a significant growth driver
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.840]   and we believe the impact of AFS in Southeast Asia and now Germany can provide further support
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.320]   to export demand.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:09.080]   As we approach the one year anniversary of China reopening to US poultry, producers are
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.720]   presented with a vastly different market landscape than a year ago. China has solidified itself
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.320]   as one of the largest export destinations for poultry, second only to Mexico. China's
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:26.760]   presence as a significant buyer keeps diversification of our export portfolio a high priority.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:33.240]   We have added 95 new direct clients in 2020 and have also continued to diversify our product
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:39.560]   and destination mix. Sales of non-traditional export items are up 30% year over year which
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:46.160]   strengthens the cutout margin. We enter Q4 with Optimus as we continue to place commodity
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.840]   items efficiently, leverage buildings overall portfolio diversity and prioritize exceptional
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.480]   customer service to meet the needs of our key customers around the world.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.080]   After a very challenging first half in 2020, our Mexican operations deliver great results
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:07.120]   in Q3 and we recorded one of the strongest Q3 in the company's history despite the unfavorable
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:13.720]   mix impacted and added operation costs relative to the same period last year. More normalized
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.640]   economic activities and improved supply demand balance in the market are increased share
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.960]   of non commodity products and a very good operation of performance all contribute to
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.760]   the results. Although overall demand is improving, we remain agile and are continuing to adapt
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.940]   our facilities by shifting production to those channels that are experienced better relative
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:40.360]   demand. The persons in Mexico explained some challenges, especially in the value categories
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.160]   due to less traffic on retail combined with a contraction in the QSR volume. But he began
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.360]   to see some signs of improvements towards the end of the quarter and we believe the positive
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.080]   trend can be sustained into Q4. We remain committed in low-term growth and demand prospecting
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.400]   Mexico where continue to invest in our DEA and premium pilgrims brand both in fresh
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:06.120]   and in prepared as well as seeing more market share in the modern channel which will bring
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:12.400]   more stable margins to our operations. Our European chicken operations deliver a nibbit
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:18.480]   in Q3 that was 13 percent sequentially above Q2 with both volumes and revenues 7 percent
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.640]   and 18 percent higher respectively. Supported by our exposure to retail and the continuous
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:30.360]   recovery in food service and QSR demand in particular. Relative to Q3 of 2019, Yibits
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.640]   will still hire 2 percent despite 8 percent lower volume and 5 percent lower revenue.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:41.840]   In the evening of COVID-19 restrictions, the introduction of UK government incentive directs
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.120]   towards food service as well as a consistent improvement in food service demand within
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.640]   continental Europe have all contributed to a better sequentially improved performance
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.320]   versus the prior quarter. They still have not yet reached prior levels.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.440]   Even during this challenging time, we continue to be relentless in investing in innovation
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.240]   delivering labor and new improvements, driving better efficiencies, managing our cost base
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.840]   and offsetting cost increases to lean manufacturing techniques and capital investments around
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.120]   automation and process flow without sacrificing the health and well-being of our team members
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.840]   which remains a priority. We are committed to delivering the safest work environment
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.880]   possible, improving the quality of our products while achieving our sustainability agenda
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:31.120]   and bird welfare targets. Our relative performance to the industry measured
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.080]   as the result of the last 12 months continues to show us improving and are facing the average
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.960]   of the competition in Europe. For the next quarter, we expect further improvements
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.400]   coming from the food service and QSR segments as these segments adapt to the situation in
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.760]   each country and we remain vigilant and prepared to react and adapt in case market conditions
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.000]   change. The performance of our newly acquired European
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.380]   pork operations has continued to improve with EBITDA on an upward momentum. We have now
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.240]   been profitable on an EBITDA basis for the last six quarters in a row with margins also
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.280]   increasing on a consistent basis. The improvement in performance was driven by robust demand
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.640]   at retail partially offset by reduction in food service. Continuous strength in pork exports
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:22.000]   especially to China as well as the implementation of operation improvements and capture of synergies.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.640]   Exports to China remain strong in Europe 100% in Q3. Also, export to China has doubled as
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.360]   a percentage of our total pork sales and we expect demands from China continue to drive
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.840]   and strengthen our fall overall exports in the near future.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.240]   All of our European fresh pork facilities are approved to export from China so we are well
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.920]   positioned to benefit from those opportunities. We also continue to evolve in our strategy
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:54.000]   and we will significantly increase our volumes with a new key customer in the next quarters.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.920]   Integration of the assets is on track to expectations. Over the next few years, we expect to generate
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.800]   an EBITDA improvement to achieve a level that is competitive with leading companies
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.040]   with similar portfolio. We have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.760]   European assets through some recent wins to increase our retail exposure and strengthen
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.920]   our partnership with key customers. We are optimistic about building upon our operation
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.240]   improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint, extract best-in-class
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.840]   operational access, capitalize export opportunities, optimize the portfolio of channels, segments
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.640]   and products, as well as strengthening our growth business with key customers to drive
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.240]   innovation in value added and higher margin areas. We have a great team in Europe dedicated
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.080]   to generating the best possible relative results by focusing on factors within our control
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.360]   while ensuring and protecting the safety and health of our team members.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.000]   Point prices has been rising since August, driven higher by a combination of stronger
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   than expected export demand and smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the U.S.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.040]   USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 2.17 billion bushels versus 1.99 billion
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.160]   last year, which includes a 550 million bushels increase in export demand. The current corn
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:23.560]   crop is projected at 14.7 billion bushels, the highest in four years, and over 1 billion
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:29.400]   bushels larger than last year. Although corn prices have risen from the lows we saw in August,
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:35.000]   prices are very similar to where they were this time last year.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.760]   Soybean yield prices have also risen since August, driven higher by larger than expected
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:46.600]   export demand, primarily to China. USDA is projecting the current soybean crop at 4.3
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:52.640]   billion bushels, up over 700 million from last year. Despite the large increase in production,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.600]   USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 290 million bushels, the lowest level in
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:03.040]   four years. The uncertainty over the science of the Chinese import program is causing increasing
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.360]   uncertainty and volatility in the oil seeds market globally.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.240]   Wheat prices in Europe has also risen recently despite the larger than expected Russian wheat
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:18.000]   crop and projected increased supply in other major wheat exporters like Australia. A slow
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.920]   start to the planting season in Russia and larger than expected export demand out of
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.320]   the U.S. are contributing to the rise prices in the wheat market.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.560]   On the chicken production, according to USDA, Q3 was down half of a percent relative to
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.880]   Q3 2019, as increased liveweights did not offset headcount reductions. The industry continues
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.120]   to maintain a larger layer flock with current levels 4.4 percent above last year, in line
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:49.780]   with the trends observed in Q1XG. The industry has also managed to reduce the average age
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:55.240]   of laying hands, promoting a younger, more efficient breed. This has allowed the industry
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.000]   to maintain flexibility to manage supply of eggs in the short term while enabling growth
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.200]   in the long term as the demand environment improves.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.360]   Overall, the trend has shown a slowing of pulit placement growth, which is in line with
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.040]   expectations, given that most of the pulit placement increases in 2019 and early to 2020
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:20.200]   were expected to be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:26.880]   From Q2 to Q3, COVID-19 related restrictions have slowly been rolled back, with many businesses
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:33.480]   and restaurants opening under modified environments to protect workers and consumer health. Throughout
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.600]   this process, consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal and have continued
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.800]   to modify their shopping and spending habits in response to the new normal environment.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.160]   This new consumer environment favors the retail channel, as many consumers are still required
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.600]   to work from home and choosing to limit exposure to potentially more crowded areas.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.540]   As a result, retail demands for chickens, like that of all proteins, have remained supported
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.800]   throughout the quarter. While food thefts demand still trail below years ago level, this
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.200]   channel has proven highly adaptable and continues to improve each month from the low points in
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:16.280]   April, led by the QSR segment. Entering Q4, the USDA expects production to be flat for
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:23.040]   the quarter on a year-over-year basis, before entering 2021, in which the USDA expects boiler
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:30.280]   production to grow 0.9% versus 2020. High unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.600]   to a food microenvironment and the fallout effects of COVID-19 will impact the channels
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:41.880]   differently. We expect a restriction of restaurant capacities, social distancing guidelines, consumer
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.360]   concern for individual health, and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:54.560]   to continue favoring the increased frequency of at-home meals. Since chicken continues
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.760]   to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins, retail demand is likely to remain
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.560]   above year-ago levels. When we expect overall food theft demand to remain more volatile
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:12.200]   and remain below year-ago levels, at least in the near term, QSR's ability to adapt quickly
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:17.040]   to the new environment in a positive sign for the chicken industry moving from late 2020
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:24.880]   to 2021. Our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:30.440]   while minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions. While we are already
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.120]   well balanced in terms of our birth size exposure, we will remain diligent in seeking opportunities
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.280]   to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.840]   by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers while optimizing
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:50.360]   our existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets. Our key customer approach
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:55.960]   is strategic and creates a basis for further accelerate growth in important categories
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.600]   by promoting more customized, high-quality, innovative products to give us a clear, long-term
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.760]   sustained competitive advantage while further improving the resilience to market filtration.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.920]   With that, let's turn to additional details to our financials. IRF-GNA in the third quarter
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.800]   was hired versus a year ago as we improved the efficiencies of our expenses but increased
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   support for expanding the JustBear brand nationally and the investment for our new prepared foods
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.520]   products both in the US and Mexico as well as the inclusion of the new assets in Europe.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.680]   Also included in the reported SGNA is our $50 million contribution to the hometown strong
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.840]   initiative and the DOJ agreement. We will continue to prioritize our capital spending
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.600]   plan this year to optimize our product mix that is aimed at improving our ability to
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.800]   supply innovative, less monetized products and strengthening partnerships with key customers.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.760]   Even during these uncertain times, while we continue to evaluate all CAPEX projects and
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:01.240]   defer those we deem known essential, we reiterate our commitment to investing on strong return
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.040]   on capital employee projects that will improve our operational efficiencies and tailor customer
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.280]   needs to further solidify competitive advantage for consumers.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.920]   Our balance sheets continue to be robust given our relentless emphasis on cash flows from
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.460]   operating activities, focus on management of working capital and discipline investment
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.760]   in high return projects. Our liquidity position remains very strong with more than $1.3 billion
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.760]   in total cash unavailability. We have no short term immediate cash requirements without bonds
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:37.280]   maturing in 2025 and 2027 and our turnover maturing in 2023.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:42.320]   During the quarter, our net debt was $1.9 billion, the lowest since 2016 and a leverage
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:48.800]   ratio of 2.5 times less than 12 months ago. Our leverage remains at a manageable level
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.080]   and we expect to continue to produce positive cash flows this year, increasing our financial
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:59.480]   capability to pursue strategic actions. We expect 2020 interest expense of around $130
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.760]   to $140 million. We have a strong balance sheet and a leverage
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.880]   that is within our target which are supportive for us to act on great opportunities during
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.480]   these uncertain times. We will remain focused on exercising great
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.000]   care ensuring that we create shareholder value by optimizing our capital structure while preserving
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.480]   the flexibility to pursue a growth strategy. And we continue to consider and evaluate all
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.480]   relevant capital allocation strategies that will match the pursuit of our growth strategy
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.920]   and continue to review each prospect accordingly to our value creating standards.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.400]   Operator, these conclusions are prepared remarks. Please open the call for questions.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.560]   Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.160]   In the interest of allowing equal access, we request that you limit your questions to
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.720]   two, then rejoin the queue for any follow-up. To ask a question, you may press star then
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.560]   one on your substance phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.800]   before pressing the keys to minimize background noise. To withdraw your question, please press
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.480]   star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:17.320]   This first question is from Benjamin Toyler with Barclays. Please go ahead.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:31.920]   Hi, good morning. My question is regarding COVID-19. How is your current level of absenteeism
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:37.440]   at plant? How has that evolved in recent weeks considering that continuously high number
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:45.040]   of cases in the US? And also if you can provide some of a kind of a wrong rate of protective
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.680]   measures related to COVID-19 during the quarter? And what do you see going forward? Thanks.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:57.000]   Yeah, thank you. And good morning. First, as we face this global coronavirus pandemic,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.160]   we have been guided by three principles. First, an uncompromised commitment to the safety
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:07.400]   of our team members. Second, recognizing and embracing a responsibility to provide quality
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.840]   food for the country. And of course, endeavoring to provide continued employment opportunities
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.880]   and benefits to our team members during a time of unprecedented economic appeal.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.960]   So, the direct costs that we are related to the extra cleaning and in our production
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:28.680]   in common areas. We also provide the PPE, including the masks and feed shoots to all
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.720]   of our team members. And we install physical barriers in our production area. And of course,
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.840]   we are maintaining social distancing wherever areas we can. We do more than 10,000 barriers
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.400]   within the first 30 days of the pandemic, and we continue to upgrade those barriers.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.720]   We also installed that dual technology UV and biconnury ionization in every plant to
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:59.040]   filter the air and neutralize potential viruses. As I mentioned, we are offering free live
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:05.440]   health online services for all of our team members that allow for virtual doctor visits
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.400]   at zero cost. And above all CDC guidelines, we remove the vulnerable team members from
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.360]   facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks. And that is creating
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.160]   some challenges to our operations because by removing those people, we have less people
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:28.720]   at our plants. Yeah, the situation is very fluid. It varies from plant to plant. But
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:34.720]   over the last months, we have increased our staffing to close to the levels that we were
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:43.160]   before COVID. So we are already running a much better mix that we were during the Q2.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:50.840]   And we are seeing a very good increase in our absenteeism levels. As people are more
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:57.000]   familiar with what we are doing, as we're gaining the trust of the entire communities,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:06.160]   people are less reluctant to return to work. And with that, we have been improving our
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.760]   ability to execute the optimal mix. Of course, we are also working with our key customers
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:17.840]   to simplify our mix to create a more optimal footprint. And with the frequent communication
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:23.280]   with them, we are ensuring there are team members. We expect to return to the optimal
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:29.440]   operation in this quarter.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:38.320]   Perfect. Thanks so much. I'm going to work some new results.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.040]   The next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.080]   Hey, good morning, everyone. Good morning, Ken.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:53.200]   Just two questions. One is, as you mix, as you change your mix, what was the mix between
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.760]   big, small, and medium, say, last year? And then what do you think it's going to be now
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.800]   and then what do you think it's going to be in about a year from now as you adjust your
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   product mixes?
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:11.720]   Ken, we are well balanced between small birds, tripeck, and large bird depoting. What we are
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:19.640]   doing is, as the demand has been shifting to more retail, we've been shifting our operations.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:26.400]   Also with the growth of QSR, we've also adapted those conditions. What we are doing for 2021
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:34.040]   is to first move that plant from big bird depoting to small bird depoting, which will increase
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   our presence in that segment. We are also doubling the capacity in our Minnesota plant
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:48.240]   to comply or comply or support the growth of our key customers and our just fair brand
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:54.320]   which has doubled the sales in the online channel over this quarter.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:01.640]   Looking into overall portfolio, we move from 46 percent of our total sales in retail to
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   around 51 percent just in 2020 with small changes in our operation. For next year expect
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:16.120]   2 percent increase in that portfolio to the retail and one to 2 percent increase in the
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.040]   small bird with those two conversions.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.520]   Great. My next question is, can you talk about the sustainability of the Mexican margins?
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:31.360]   Particularly, I did see that there was a little bit of a FX benefit. How do you think about
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.200]   the Mexican operation? I think you did say that it's still continuing the momentum into
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:42.640]   the fourth quarter. Then how do you think about it for 2021? How do we frame it in our
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   minds?
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:50.000]   Sure. We've been talking about Mexico over the last year that they are very volatile quarter
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.120]   over quarter, but they're more stable if you take a longer period of time or within a year.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:00.200]   What happened in the first quarter or the first semester in Mexico was a complete imbalance
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:06.280]   during supply and demand. The industry increased supply during the first semester. At the same
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:13.160]   time demand because of the COVID-19 really create a challenging environment. As you remember
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:20.640]   during Mexico, there was no support from the government with the COVID-19 like we had in
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:28.520]   US and Europe. There was no governmental stimulus or unemployment benefits. We created a sharp
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:36.320]   slowdown and recession in the region. It really affected the demand both in the food
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.880]   service and retail. While in the US, we saw an increasing retail compensating at least
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.040]   partially the shut down in food service that didn't happen in Mexico. That's why the supply
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:55.920]   and demand was completely off balance. As the industry adapted their supply for the Q3
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:04.400]   and we adapt it to that situation as well, we reduce our costs and we also cut production.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.720]   The supply and demand improved a lot. We saw the rebound in the food service and demand
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:17.920]   in Q3. Now, we have very stable prices during this time in Mexico. We expect this to continue
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:24.960]   during Q4. Q4 has always been a stronger quarter for Mexico with the festivities. We don't know
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:32.120]   at which point that will be reduced because of the COVID restrictions. We've seen some
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:38.960]   increase in cases in Mexico. There could be some more restrictions in the Q4, but given
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.840]   the supply and demand situation that we are right now, the results are sustainable.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:52.280]   Now, for Q1, we expect the industry to increase production to equate supply and demand and
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:58.840]   the return to more normal levels. Mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again,
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:05.160]   but we expect to be very stable year over year. Of course, our strategy is supportive
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.480]   of the growth to increase the higher margin differentiated products as well. We saw a
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:15.200]   little bit of impact in the prepare foods, especially on the more affordable products
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.760]   during Q1, but we continue to invest and highly differentiated the pigments products continue
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:26.480]   to sell really well. Along the turn, despite the volatility, Mexico is a growing economy
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.880]   and as the population increased their disposable income, it leads to a significant growth in
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   protein consumption.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:37.880]   Great. I really appreciate that answer. Thank you, okay.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:45.280]   The next question is from Ben Bienvenue with Steve Ennings. Please go ahead.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:54.160]   Hey, good morning. I want to ask, you touched on it in your opening comments with ASF in
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.720]   China and Germany. I want to ask on Germany more specifically. I would think that's a
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.840]   nice boon for the tool of business. Just curious on what you're seeing in that business
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.120]   both as it relates to the impact on the domestic market and then an uptick in potential demand
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:11.360]   from that market as well and how you think your position to capture that benefit.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:19.120]   Yeah, thank you Ben. The operations in Europe are more focused on the retail. So we produce
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:24.800]   most of our products in UK for the retail UK market and because of the high welfare,
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:32.040]   we command the premium in that region. The big competition, as you refer, is on the food
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:40.320]   service sector of imported products from Poland and Germany mainly and Spain on the pork side.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:46.200]   As the Germans had these issues with their production and because of the ban in China,
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:54.640]   it actually increases the sales in the UK market. It also creates the opportunity for
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:01.440]   our UK products to be sold into China. So what we saw is that on the, what we call fifth
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:08.800]   quarter products, significant increase in pricing, but on the normal products like loins
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:14.440]   and others, we see the prices more stable because it's a zero sum game at the end of
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:21.680]   the day. So it increases the opportunity to China, so that was welcome. I think our sales
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.680]   have, like we mentioned, have doubled during Q3 and we've seen some very stable pricing,
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:32.200]   but it also increased the competition in the food service segments in UK.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:41.040]   Okay, great. My second question is related to grain. And apologies if I missed this in
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.200]   your opening comment, I did hear your overview of the market. Could you talk about how your
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.800]   position relative to the market, you know, are you more hand and mouth at the moment?
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.720]   Do you have any basis secured? Any color you could offer there on how your position, you
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.640]   know, through the balance of fourth quarter and into next year would be helpful.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:03.280]   Hey Ben, this is Joe. Thank you for the question. Obviously we've seen prices of corn and soybean
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:08.240]   no increase in the last few months, which has been the result of a few factors for corn.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.320]   And we've seen a reduction from the supply side with USDA reporting 6 million fewer planted
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.400]   acres than they originally estimated back in March. We also saw our final stocks for
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.400]   2019 end up being 200 million bushels less than was expected when the final counting
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.680]   was done. On the current crop, we actually, for the acres of our planet, see pretty good
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:31.560]   yields above trend line yields, so it's not an issue on the supply side in terms of U.S.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:36.800]   production. But on the demand side, we've also seen much bigger exports at demand primarily
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:42.760]   driven by China. Still, the USDA is projecting a carryout of around 2.1 billion bushels and
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:48.200]   that includes a 30% increase in export demand from last year. So even if export demand ends
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.240]   up higher than what USDA is projecting, corn stocks should still be in mind with previous
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.200]   years. On soybeans, USDA is projecting a 290 million bushel carryout, which would be the
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.440]   lowest carryout in five years. This projection, though, includes a 31% increase in export
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:07.640]   demand driven by China. In addition to the increased export demand, Argentina, which
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.240]   is one of the world's largest oil seed exporting countries, is in the midst of a historic economic
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.840]   crisis which is causing farmers there to hold back available supplies from the market, adding
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.200]   more pressure to the U.S. to meet this demand. We believe the market is likely to feel anxious
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.760]   about U.S. soybean supplies until there's a resolution to this currency situation in
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:32.040]   Argentina or in South American supplies can be available to meet this demand. In terms
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.000]   of how we're positioned, we've always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive to the
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   market conditions and the risks we see and we feel very comfortable with where we are
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.640]   in corn and soy. We do recognize the risks of soybean supplies in the U.S. and our positions
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.760]   reflect that.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:52.480]   Okay. Awesome. Thanks and best of luck.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.500]   Thank you again.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:39:03.580]   As a reminder, if you have a question, please press star then 1. The next question is from
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.880]   Michael Picken with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:13.440]   Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of the move,
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:20.040]   I guess, into retail. Some of that Big Bird product, is that being chopped up and put
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:25.920]   into trays and how is that impacting some of the margins on the commodity business?
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:34.560]   Yes, Mike. There's a lot of product from the Big Bird, especially during promotional seasonality
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:39.820]   during the summer that from the Big Bird's end up being put in the tray to be sold in
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:46.760]   the retailers. We continue to do that. I think the challenge to the industry is that we need
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.880]   to have the label available and the facilities available to do more of that. That's why the
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:40:00.640]   industry has not increased more the production to the tray pack as we want or as the demand
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:06.160]   continues to grow. It's also because of that that we are increasing the capacity in our
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.600]   Minnesota plant.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:14.360]   As of today, yes, we are buying Big Bird meat and we continue to put it on the tray, especially
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.920]   during Saturdays. I think the whole industry is doing that.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:25.280]   Great. My second question is, just looking at the ... You mentioned that your absentee
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.680]   rates are starting to go down and you're starting to get back to your normal mix. In terms of
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:36.880]   some of the deboned dark meat, are you starting to return that to historic levels? What could
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.440]   that mean for the leg quarter prices, which is seeing the most pressure? Can that help
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:47.200]   for the fact that China is taking more pork? Can that help leg quarters? Why haven't leg
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.040]   quarter prices moved if there's more deboned dark meat potentially being produced? It seems
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.320]   like at the very least China is taking more US pork.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:05.520]   Yes, you're right Mike. Because of the absenteeism and also the food service industry in US, the
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:13.400]   industry produced 3% more leg quarters in July and August than the same period last year,
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:19.560]   despite a lower total production. That put a lot of pressure in the leg quarter pricing.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:25.800]   As we are seeing more, the reopening of the food service and as we are seeing the absenteeism
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:30.400]   and the staffing of our plants increasing for us and for the whole industry, we are seeing
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:37.200]   more deboning. We are already at levels comparable to last year in terms of deboning, which will
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:43.640]   reduce the pressure in the leg quarters. Of course, China has been also more active in
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:50.360]   the leg quarter market over the last month. And we're seeing that in the leg quarter inventory
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:56.800]   that was up on a sequentially basis up to August, but we are seeing a reduction. And
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:04.320]   also the inventory today is down 9% compared to the peak Q1 average that we have. So those
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:09.560]   two factors can contribute to the reduction in the leg quarter production, which is a commodity
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:18.480]   item, as I mentioned. And the China interest, I think we saw over the last weeks, although
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:25.520]   not today, the increase in the oil prices and the reduction in the dollar, which increased
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:33.000]   the availability of dollars from the developing countries, which also increases the demand
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.080]   for leg quarters. So what could help on the leg quarters going forward is both on supply
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.920]   and demand. On supply is exactly what you said. Last leg quarters because of the improvement
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:49.840]   in labor efficiencies and the more sales in the domestic market on the food service and
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:57.720]   on demand because of low prices and because of more stable income in the developing economies.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:11.880]   The next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:19.000]   Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You know, Fabio, just as I'm thinking
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.360]   about it, you know, the small bird and resale channels, obviously, has been tremendously
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:29.400]   profitable for you guys during, you know, this time period and, you know, with the plant
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:34.200]   conversion coming. But, you know, with commodity big bird remaining, you know, in the cutout
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:40.640]   value you have here remaining under such pressure, just at what point does it make sense to start
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:45.960]   talking about converting another plant, whether that's to retail or to small bird because
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:51.720]   it just seems like that big bird portion is not going to improve without more capacity
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.440]   either being converted or taking out of the market, you know, in some capacity.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:03.280]   Sure. Thank you Peter. I think the decision to convert the plant is a more long term decision.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.240]   And we always make those decisions combined with our key customer strategy. As we see
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:15.520]   the demand of these key customers growing, we take action in our portfolio. So, and
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:22.120]   that makes a lot of sense for us to do net conversion right now from that operation from
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:28.240]   big bird to small bird to support this growth. I think, again, you need to look into a more
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.520]   broader long term perspective. We continue to expect the food service sector to rebound.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:41.200]   If you look at the food service sector, today the food service restaurants are now 13 percent
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.400]   year over year and that is impacting the big bird deboning for sure, while the key of fires
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:54.000]   are up nine percent. As we go to a more normal operations, as we see maybe the development
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.400]   of vaccines, we don't know when that's going to happen or we see more openings of the restaurants,
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:07.200]   we expect the food service restaurants, especially on the full service, to regain some market
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:13.720]   share that they are not operating today. So, I think it's a long term decision and it's
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:20.480]   also a very difficult decision to move from big bird to a smaller because we have the
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:27.200]   growers and we have the feed mills. It's all built to that specific bird. Our plants in
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:33.880]   the United States are really customized to that specific segment. So, any conversion,
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:41.680]   it really requires significant capital and requires some significant changes in the overall
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:47.640]   supply chain, both starting from the growers, your feed mills, and your field operations.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:54.200]   So, it's a high capital investment that needs to be supported for the long run. So, that's
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:46:01.080]   why we don't see a lot of conversions in our industry. Of course, if this situation continues
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:08.080]   for a longer period of time, you can see some conversions. I think also it's important
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:12.880]   to know that some other players don't have the key customer relationships that we have
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:20.080]   and moving from the big bird to the small bird or to the keys ready require a customer
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:26.000]   and a key customer to support. And since they don't have those relationships, it's harder
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:36.320]   for them to do some conversions. No, that's helpful. And then maybe just to follow up,
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:41.320]   given where the balance sheet is now and something you talked about in your period remarks, how
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:47.280]   should we think about M&A potential maybe from a geographic perspective or does it make sense
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.760]   to get bigger in pork in Europe and going into 2021? Just any help there and then maybe
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:58.800]   you can also comment on any updates on your CFO search. Thanks very much.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:04.000]   Sure. In terms of strategy, I think our strategy continues to fail. And our growth strategy
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.720]   continues intact. And as we mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet. We're looking
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:16.640]   to increasing our prepared foods operation and our branded operation to create a more
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:22.480]   balanced portfolio. And we're also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:28.560]   value from operational efficiencies. We're seeing targets both in the US and outside
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:34.760]   the US, geographical diversification and to growth in Europe. And we will evaluate all
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:42.360]   alternatives to our value creation standards. In terms of the CFO, we are in the process
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:51.880]   of finding another CFO. We already engage recruiting firms and we should have some news
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:56.560]   in the near future. Great. Thanks very much, guys.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   The next question is from Adam Steinwilson with Goldman Sachs & Co. Please go ahead.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Morning. Hi. So maybe first is the clarification
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:19.280]   or a little more detail on the expansion of the Minnesota plant for case ready and the
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:26.640]   conversion of the Texas plant, small bird from Big Bird. What's the net impact on your
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.720]   production volume? And what's the capital cost of those projects?
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:37.960]   Yeah. In terms of total volume, I think we should be just a little bit up. We expect
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:44.880]   to be to grow in line with USDA expectations and the industry for 2021, which is a little
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:52.960]   bit lower than 1%. Yes, as we have more birds in Minnesota, but we'll also reduce the weight
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:58.120]   in our operation on the Big Bird that we are transforming into a small bird. So we expect
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:06.560]   to be for 2021 in line with those two. In terms of investments, it's not very significant
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:15.520]   to our total capex. As the conversion of the small bird plant, it's a simpler conversion.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:22.480]   Of course, that QSR requires some DSIs, which is portioning equipment and some marination
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:28.600]   equipment. And we're going to invest in automation in that plant as well. Today is a manual deboning
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:34.760]   operation, and we're going to invest in the automated deboning. So the investment is close
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:42.160]   to $20 to $25 million in that operation. And in the case of the case value operation,
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.120]   it's close to $70 million. So overall, it is a total of $100 million that we're going
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:52.440]   to invest in those two conversions. Okay, that's a helpful call there.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:57.480]   The follow-up was, I just want to make sure I heard something right from the paragraph
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:04.880]   that talks about the prepared food business in the U.S. declining 26%, I think is what
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.840]   I heard, and maybe hoping to expand it on that. That's a business that I think has had
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:15.560]   a bit more challenges over the years and just -- is it really just a question of returns
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.600]   of school and food service traffic, or how do we think about that business from a margin
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:25.720]   profile moving forward? Yeah, then that's exactly it. We -- in our
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:30.520]   prepared food business, we have a strong brand, which is the Pierce brand that is mainly a
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:37.840]   food service brand. We also are very strong in the school with our Gold case brand. Both
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:44.240]   those segments are the ones that are most affected by the COVID-19. The non-commercial
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:53.080]   food service that includes schools were down 66% at Q2, and now they are down 43%. We are
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:51:00.000]   seeing some school reopens, which could help, but it's a segment that is still down 40%.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.920]   On what we call the commercial food service, which is the street business, where our Pierce
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:15.040]   brand is a leading brand in wings and in chunks, we saw that at Q2 they end up 36% lower than
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.800]   the prior year, but they're rebounding, and then today they are close to 4% lower than
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:26.540]   the same period last year. So the food service business has been recovering, and with that
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:36.240]   our Pierce brand has recovered in our volumes, but the school system is still close to 40%
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:43.360]   lower than the prior year. And that's why we're investing in more retail branded business.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:50.360]   As we mentioned, our Pierce brand has increased more than 30%, and we have been very successful
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:56.000]   in spending the JustBear brand on the fresh category, but it's been very successful on
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.920]   the online segment and also on the higher attribute segment in our key customers to the prepared
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.920]   food segment.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:09.720]   All right, great. That's helpful color. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:18.560]   The next question comes from Carla Cazella with CT Morgan. Please go ahead.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:25.240]   Hi, my question is regarding your leverage. The three times target, how comfortable or
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:30.160]   how high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional M&A, and are you
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:36.680]   seeing any more M&A opportunities just given the volatility in worldwide protein market?
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:43.240]   Yeah, thank you Carla. We've said this five times of two to three times because it's the
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:51.120]   best capital structure that can protect and reduce our interest payments while not creating
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:53:00.400]   any problem for our bonds and for our leverage. The two to three times is in normal operations.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:07.480]   Of course, during some acquisition, if we have a great plan on how to reduce that back,
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:15.240]   we can go further. I don't think there is a number that is specific or on where we go.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.720]   I think it's more about what is the plan to leverage. Of course, the plan to leverage
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:26.520]   could include the issue of stock, and that's why Pilgrims as a public traded company has
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:33.040]   that opportunity to use the stock as a currency, not to increase the leverage to points where
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:38.360]   we don't think it is prudent in the case of significant acquisition that would be transformational
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:43.560]   for the company. Okay, and just one last point.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:49.040]   No, sorry. In terms of M&A, yes, we are seeing more targets. Of course, the whole situation
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:55.800]   about traveling has created some challenges in terms of seeing and visiting assets, but
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:02.680]   we are seeing some targets that are still very interesting to us and could create a
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:10.560]   lot of value for our shareholders. Okay, great. In the event that JBS is able
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:15.200]   to list the U.S. business, would that cause any need for changing your structure?
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:22.280]   Yes, we don't believe so. I think JBS has said many times that they continue to support
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:27.320]   Pilgrims to be a public traded company, and just as I mentioned, it is a great way for
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:34.320]   us to keep our growth. We can use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:40.440]   and transformational event for Pilgrims. Okay, thank you.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:50.440]   Once again, if you have a question, please press star and one on your telephone.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:57.800]   Gentlemen, there are no more questions registered at this time. I would like to turn the conference
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   back over to Fabio Sandri for closing remarks. Well, thank you all. We would like to reiterate
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:09.400]   our continued commitment to our valued team members to provide them with a safe and healthy
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.880]   working environment while supporting our duty to maintain food production and supply to
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:19.920]   customers. We are looking forward to closing 2020 with good results in spite of the volatility.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:25.560]   Our diverse portfolio of differentiated products tailored to support our key customer strategy.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:31.120]   In conjunction with our broad geographic footprint, we continue to generate consistent performance
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:36.600]   and minimize margin volatility in challenging market conditions relative to competitors.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.960]   We will continue to seek new growth potential both organically and through acquisitions
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:45.760]   while offering even more differentiated products portfolio within our business to support key
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.960]   customers needs by cultivating a culture of constant innovation. We would like to thank
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:55.880]   everyone in the Pilgrims family, including our family farm partners, suppliers and our
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:00.120]   customers who make our business possible. As always, we appreciate your interest in our
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:09.120]   company. Thank you for joining us today. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:15.840]   concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   >> Welcome to the ever source energy Q3 2020 results conference call.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.040]   My name is John and I will be operator for today's call.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.000]   At this time, all participants are in listen only mode.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.900]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.300]   During the question and answer session, if you do have a question, press star then one
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.480]   on your touch phone phone.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.240]   Please note that this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.680]   And I want to turn the call over to Jeffrey Cockton.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.200]   >> Thank you very much, John.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.200]   Good morning and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.080]   I'm Jeff Cockton, ever source energy's vice president for investor relations.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.400]   During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   And as you can see on slide one, some of the statements made during this investor call may be
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.100]   forward looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.040]   of the US private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.840]   The forward looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.660]   to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.780]   to differ materially for forecast and projections.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.100]   These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.740]   Additional information about the various factors
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.920]   that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on form 10K
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.300]   for the year ended December 31st, 2019, and our form 10Q for the three months ended June 30th, 2020.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.520]   Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAP measures
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.000]   and how those measures reconcile to GAP results is contained within our news release
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.100]   and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10K.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.800]   Seeking today will be Phil Lembo, our executive vice president and CFO.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.640]   Also joining us today are Joe Nolan, our executive vice president
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600]   for strategy, customer, and corporate relations.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.260]   John Marrera, our treasurer and senior VP for finance and regulatory.
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260]   And Jay Booth, our controller.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.660]   Now, I will turn slide two and turn over the call to Phil.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.160]   >> Thank you, Jeff.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.860]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.740]   I hope everyone on the call remains healthy and that your families are safe and doing well.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.060]   This morning, I'll cover a variety of areas, review the results of the third quarter,
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.940]   discuss recent regulatory developments including the acquisition of the assets
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.200]   of Columbia Gap of Massachusetts, provide an update on recent developments
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.720]   around our offshore wind partnership with Orsif.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.040]   I'll start with slide two, noting that recurring earnings were $1.02 per share
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.740]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of 98 cents per share
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.300]   in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.580]   Gap results, which include a charge of 1 cent per share relating
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.660]   to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gap of Massachusetts,
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.920]   total $1.01 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.140]   In the first nine months of 2020, recurring earnings excluding Columbia Gap's acquisition
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.540]   cost total $2.80 per share compared with recurring earnings of $2.69 per share
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.280]   in the first nine months of 2019 and excluding the Northern Path transmission impairment charge.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.460]   Gap results for September of this year were $2.76 per share.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.280]   Turning to our business segments, our electric distribution segment earned $0.60 per share
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.400]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.740]   The low earnings were results of both higher storm restoration costs
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.700]   and property tax expense as well as the impact of sub-shared dilution.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.340]   Our electric transmission segment earned $0.36 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.660]   with recurring earnings of $0.33 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.440]   Improved results were driven by the continued investment and reliability
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.580]   in our transmission facilities partially offset by shared dilution.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.260]   Our gas distribution segment lost $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2020
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.900]   compared with a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of last year.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.740]   Improved results were due to higher revenues.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.780]   I should note that because we didn't close on our acquisition
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.640]   of Columbia gas of Massachusetts assets until October 9th,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.320]   the transaction had no impact on this gas segment, this segment during the quarter.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.800]   Each quarter this year, we've booked acquisition related costs at the parent
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.780]   and have segregated them for increased transparency.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.340]   Beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, ongoing results of our new gas franchise
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.860]   which is named Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts will be reflected
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.680]   in the natural gas segment.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.060]   Integration related costs, however, will continue to be recorded separately
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.120]   at the parent and excluded from our recurring gas earnings.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.080]   Our water distribution segment earned $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2020
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.580]   compared with earnings of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.220]   Improved results were due to a $3.5 million after tax gain on the sale
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.500]   of our Hena Massachusetts area facilities to the town.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.460]   Eversource parent earned $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020 excluding the Columbia gas
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.900]   of Massachusetts asset acquisition cost equal to our earnings in the third quarter of last year.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.300]   As you probably noted in our earnings release and can see on slide three,
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:30.560]   we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings per share guidance of $3.60 to $3.70
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.780]   and that is excluding the non-recurring costs related to the purchase
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.500]   of Columbia gas of Massachusetts assets.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.620]   We are also reaffirming our long term EPS growth rate of 5 to 7%
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.060]   from our core regulated business through the year 2024.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.700]   We continue to be, to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range largely due
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.080]   to the investments we need to make on behalf of our customers
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.000]   as we outlined for you earlier in the year.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.940]   As a reminder, while we fully expect the Columbia gas assets to be accreted
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:16.540]   to our earnings per share starting immediately in 2021, we have not yet updated our long term
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.320]   financial outlook to reflect the acquisition of Columbia gas assets
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.480]   in our capital, our cap backs that are our earnings growth.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.800]   In addition, as we disclosed previously, earnings from offshore wind would be incremental
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.180]   to our core business growth.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:40.120]   We'll provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecasts adding
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.560]   in EPS gas company Massachusetts projections and provide an update
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.880]   of our offshore wind partnership during our year end call in late February.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.860]   From the third quarter results, I'll turn to slide four and our experience restoring power
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.960]   after tropical storm ETIES ravaged Connecticut on October 4th.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.840]   We serve 149 cities and towns in Connecticut and every one
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.900]   of these communities suffered damage from ETIES, much of it catastrophic.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:21.600]   As you can see on the slide, we had nearly 22,000 damage locations that we had
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.920]   to address and brought in an army of electric restoration
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.440]   and tree crews to restore power all the while working on the restoration in a pandemic setting.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:39.980]   The restoration process lasted nine days, meaning we completed our work one to two days faster
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:46.380]   than we had in the last two tropical storms that hit Connecticut even though we had 30
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:53.140]   or 35 percent more damage locations and most importantly, we completed that work safely
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:59.300]   with no serious electrical contact and no COVID exposure among the enormous workforce we brought
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.160]   to Connecticut, just a tremendous effort by all of our employees
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.720]   from across all parts of every source.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:16.140]   At this time, we estimate that deferred costs across all three states will total more
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:23.180]   than $275 million, with the vast majority of that's incurred in Connecticut.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:29.060]   That figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:35.660]   We're still actively pursuing invoices from hundreds of vendors that assisted us
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.240]   during the statewide restoration effort.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.960]   Where we were setting new poles or hanging miles of new wires or replacing hundreds
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.080]   of transformers, these related costs have to be capitalized.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:54.560]   The ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation of performance in safety
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.180]   and expeditiously restoring power to our customers is pending an ongoing review
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.500]   by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or PURA.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:11.040]   That review is scheduled to be completed in late April of 2021.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.380]   Sticking with our regulated business, I'll turn it to slide five
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.700]   in a review of this year's distribution rate reviews.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:27.940]   This past Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities issued its decision
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.880]   in the NSTAR GAS rate review that we filed last year.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:38.720]   It supports our continued investment in the NSTAR GAS system on behalf of our 300,000 customers.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.720]   The decision allows NSTAR GAS to increase distribution revenues
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.560]   by $23 million on an annualized basis.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:55.160]   The DPU approved an ROE of 9.9% and a capital structure with 54.77% equity.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:02.260]   It also permits us to implement performance-based rate making for a 10-year term
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:09.580]   that with sounds operating performance by NSTAR GAS will target annual base rate increase
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.180]   of inflation plus 1.03%.
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:19.680]   This is an earnings sharing mechanism that would return 75% of the benefit to customers
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.140]   should we see the ROE of 10.9% and sharing mechanism on the downside
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.780]   if our ROE falls below 8.4%.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:34.600]   Also exciting is the decision also approves our first ever geothermal pilot program.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.000]   Our other longstanding rate proceeding involves public service of New Hampshire.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.840]   In New Hampshire last month, we and all the parties to the PSNH rate case filed a proposed
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.400]   settlement in the rate review that is pending for nearly, you know, a year and a half.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:57.680]   You can see from the slide, we settled on a $45 million annualized rate increase
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:05.700]   that includes a 9.3% return on equity and a 54.4% equity layer.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.280]   Should regulators approve the settlement, the permanent increase would take effect
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.480]   in January 1st of 2021.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.940]   You may recall that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission allowed us
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:29.080]   to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately $28 million back in July, July 1st of 2019.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.600]   The final approved rates would be retroactive back to that date, 18 months.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.260]   We would recover that in a true up over the course of the year 2021.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.240]   We can settle -- consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:53.020]   to PSNH's first general increase in about a decade and have asked the New Hampshire PUC
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.100]   to approve the settlement before the end of November.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:04.000]   From the rate review, reviews I'll turn to slide six and our recently completed acquisition
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.360]   of the assets of Columbia Gas and Massachusetts for $1.1 billion
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.100]   of cash excluding working capital adjustments.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.260]   Most of these assets were signed to Eversuice Gas Company in Massachusetts,
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.460]   a new subsidiary I mentioned that we formed in May of 2020.
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:28.400]   As you can see on the slide, much of Eversuice Gas's service territory is adjacent
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.040]   to NSTAR gas or Yankee gas service territories.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.380]   Additionally, NSTAR Electric already provides electric service to about 20
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.040]   of the communities that Eversuice Gas serves with natural gas.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:49.140]   As a result, we expect to realize operational benefits for our newest 330,000 natural gas customers
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.320]   and the communities where they live.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:14:00.420]   To finance the transaction, we sold approximately $500 million of equity in June
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.320]   and we financed the debt portion of the transaction in August.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.420]   And again, we are very confident that this transaction will be accretive
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:13.800]   to our earnings per share in 2021 and incrementally accretive in the years ahead.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.860]   A critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.060]   to all stakeholders is an eight-year rate plan that we negotiated
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:28.080]   with the Massachusetts Attorney General and other key parties prior to our filing
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.180]   with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.180]   The key elements of that plan are listed on slide seven.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.840]   It will allow us to make the necessary investments in our Eversuice Gas of Mass System
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.940]   and reflect those investments and rates in a reasonably timely manner.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.060]   We're thankful that the DPU approved the settlement
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.600]   and the acquisition very quickly.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.140]   Now that we have the keys to the property and a long-term plan in place,
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:59.880]   we are - we have focused on providing our new Eversuice Gas customers with the same high level
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.300]   of service that we provide our other 550,000 natural gas distribution company customers
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.180]   that we have in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:15.340]   As I noted earlier, we plan to integrate Eversuice Gas of Massachusetts
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.140]   into our updated five-year projections that we'll provide you in February.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.740]   We continue to project approximately $3 billion of regulated company capital investments this year.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:33.860]   Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and the need to take crews off of capital projects
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:39.400]   for a significant part of August to deal with the aftermath of tropical stormy Said.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:46.220]   Through September, our capital investments totaled approximately $2.2 billion.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:52.220]   That's approximately the same level as this time last year in 2019.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.200]   We made considerable progress on our transmission capital program
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.900]   in the third quarter, putting several projects into service at or below budget.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:08.820]   These benefits of lower costs will slow through to New England's electric customers.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:15.860]   From the regulated business, I'll turn to offshore wind partnership with Orsted on slide 8.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.800]   We've had a few developments since our July 31st earnings call.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:28.000]   The most significant development was that in August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.160]   posted a complete review schedule for our 130 megawatt South Fork project on Long Island.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.880]   The schedule culminates in a decision on a construction
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:46.380]   and operations permit, or COP as it's known, in mid-January of 2022.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.260]   We are also making progress on the other permits.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:55.900]   In September, we filed a settlement proposal with the New York Department of Public Service
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:01.760]   to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the construction, operations,
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.980]   and maintenance of the project that lies within New York jurisdiction.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:11.920]   In October, several of New York State agencies signaled their support
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.860]   for this proposal by signing on to the agreement.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.420]   We've structured an agreement on host community payments
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:25.920]   in the necessary real estate rights with the town of East Hampton, where the offshore cable will land,
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.980]   and will be connected to the Long Island grid.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:34.280]   New York Public Service Commission citing hearings for South Fork is scheduled
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.740]   to commence the first week of December.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:45.200]   We continue to expect the state signing process to be completed in 2021 before bone issues the COP.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:52.140]   Based on that schedule, we now expect the project end to service in the fourth quarter of 2023.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:58.560]   This is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our May and July earnings calls
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.580]   while we were still waiting for the review schedule.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:10.540]   Joining to our other projects, you recall that we filed our bone application for Revolution Wind in March.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:16.040]   We expect bone to establish a review schedule for that project in the first quarter
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.160]   of 2021.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:24.400]   We do not expect to provide an updated in-service date for this project until the schedule is issued,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.640]   but at this point, it's unlikely that the project will end the service by the end of 2023.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:39.140]   Also, we filed our sunrise wind application with bone on September 1 and expect bone
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.260]   to establish a review schedule for the project next year.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.560]   Once we receive that review schedule, we'll be able to better estimate a more up-to-date
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.720]   in-service schedule.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:55.320]   But again, at this time, it would seem that the end of '24 in service is not likely.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:01.540]   We're very optimistic about our offshore wind business and expect many opportunities
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.120]   over the coming months and years to expand our offshore wind partnership
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.440]   beyond the 1,700 and 14 megawatts currently on the contract.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.440]   As we mentioned before, we have enough leaf capacity to construct at least 4,000 megawatts
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.580]   on the 550 square miles of ocean tracks that we have
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:26.640]   under long-term leaf off the southeast coast of Massachusetts.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:33.320]   To this point, on October 20th, we submitted a number of alternative bids
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.960]   into the second New York offshore wind IRSP, where the state is looking for between 1,000
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.820]   and 2,500 megawatts.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:46.940]   New York state officials have indicated that they expect to announce the winner --
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.460]   well, winners before the end of the year.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:56.100]   Our sunrise project, as a reminder, won the largest portion
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.480]   of New York's first IRSP last year, 880 megawatts.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:07.500]   Additionally, just last week, Rhode Island Governor Gina Romando announced
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.920]   that her state will target early next year for issuing an IRSP
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.320]   to 600 megawatts of additional offshore wind.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.680]   As you know, the majority of our revolution wind capacity,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.740]   400 megawatts, will be sold to Rhode Island,
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.080]   with the balance going to Connecticut.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.460]   Thank you very much for joining us this morning,
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.640]   and I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.700]   >> Thanks, Phil, and I'll turn the call back to John just to remind you how
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.280]   to enter questions in the Q&A queue.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.440]   >> Thank you.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.580]   If you do have a question, press star then 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.880]   Once again, press star then 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.920]   If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.860]   >> Thank you, John.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.240]   Our first question this morning is from Shar from Guggenheim.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.360]   Good morning, Shar.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.120]   >> Good morning, Jeff.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.720]   Good morning, Phil.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.400]   >> Good morning, Shar.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.160]   >> So a couple questions here.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.440]   Just to fill some of your language around sort of the growth rate,
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.660]   you know, obviously, which still excludes Columbia gas and offshore wind.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.280]   Obviously, these are, you know, very creative,
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.320]   and you're already conservatively kind of well within your band.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.240]   So should we sort of be thinking about these incremental items
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   as potentially rating your growth rate to maybe 6 to 8 percent,
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.980]   or something that will hit you to the top end and then sort of extend
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.360]   that runway with your current trajectory?
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.460]   I mean, the reason we ask is 6 to 8 percent seems to be sort
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:45.580]   of that new top quartile bucket in our space where 5 to 7 percent is becoming a little bit
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.280]   more typical.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.920]   Secures how you're sort of thinking about this?
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.500]   Do you see value to be a top, to be in the top quartile,
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.180]   or you don't think you need to award it for it?
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.860]   So curious on that as we think about you layering its plant.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.620]   >> Sure. Sure, thanks for the question, and I hope you've been doing well.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:10.500]   Certainly, the addition of Columbia gas and will be additive
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.280]   to our existing forecast.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.040]   So we're working through all the details of that, so we're able to provide you
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.080]   with a full update in February, but we expect
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.900]   to get significant benefit from that franchise.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:33.240]   And as you say, we also expect as those offshore wind projects come
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.580]   online to also be additive.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.180]   To remind folks, I know I said it, but, and you did,
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:45.640]   that the 5 to 7 percent growth rate is from the existing core business
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.220]   which doesn't include Columbia assets.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:55.020]   It also doesn't include grid modernization activities
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:01.140]   that are currently pending in Connecticut and New Hampshire or AMI
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:07.780]   that could be a potential to move forward relatively soon
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:13.000]   in Massachusetts in terms of taking a look at that by the regulator.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.960]   So I see that we have a number of levers to grow and grow
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.920]   at even a higher rate than we had expected before.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.200]   >> Got it.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.920]   That's helpful.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.520]   And then just lastly for me is can you just maybe talk a little bit
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.500]   about your expectations for the legislation in Connecticut?
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.700]   I mean, the legislation in the past was more constructive
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.000]   than the draft legislation, but obviously some disappointment
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.540]   with the refunds and penalties offset
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.760]   by the potential upside from like PBRs.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.440]   So sort of how are you guys thinking about this entirely?
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:54.880]   >> Sure. The energy legislation we've said consistently
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:02.560]   that PBR is a formula and a template that we think is effective.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.860]   We have PBR structures in other states, and we think
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.440]   that having a robust discussion on PBR
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.600]   in Connecticut makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.500]   So we're very supportive of that provision.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:24.100]   You know, really, you know, the energy legislation directed Pura
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.880]   to evaluate that and open a docket by the middle of next year.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:36.120]   So June of 2021, and it authorizes Pura to, you know,
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.160]   establish storm standards and potential penalties,
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.260]   as you mentioned.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:45.000]   There is an increased potential of penalties.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.440]   Currently, those penalties are two and a half percent
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.500]   of our distribution revenues in Connecticut,
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.940]   and that goes up to four percent.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.480]   So, you know, it also gives Pura some additional time,
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.480]   you know, to review cases, so, you know,
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.880]   which is also something that, you know, seems to be appropriate.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.720]   So the legislation, as you indicated, is out there,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.560]   and Pura is working through the details of it,
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.700]   and we expect to be working through that in a constructive way
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.260]   with them over the next several months.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.900]   >> Got it. Terrific. That's all I had today.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:23.700]   Thanks, guys.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.540]   >> All right. Thanks, Shar.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:30.480]   Our next question is from Steve Fleischman from Wolfe.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.540]   Good morning, Steve.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.480]   >> Good morning.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.920]   Oh, can you hear me?
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.720]   >> Yes, Steve, I can.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.560]   >> Yeah. Great.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.680]   So just a question on the delays in your offshore wind projects.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.220]   Could you maybe talk to --
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.700]   I know we don't know the exact timing.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.500]   But how should we think about the impact on the economics
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:02.800]   of those projects from delay or puts and takes?
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.840]   And is it hurting the economics
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.600]   of the projects you already have signed up to?
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.640]   >> Yeah. Thanks for your question, Steve,
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.880]   and I hope you and your family are doing well.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:20.920]   I guess to go to the puts and takes piece, you know,
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.460]   I don't think that folks should automatically think
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:29.500]   that schedule changes result in ups or downs.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:35.360]   There's some benefits or that people may not consider in that.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:41.440]   So certainly if you are looking at adjusted schedules,
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.100]   you might be able to adjust your installation vessel
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:51.320]   optimization better, you know, the turbine sizes themselves
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.780]   are getting larger so you could move
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.460]   to larger turbine sizes if projects are due
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.220]   at a later time period versus an earlier time period.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.720]   And certainly the cost supply chain and availability
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.060]   of materials and supply chain is only getting better.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.400]   So I would say that, you know, there's opportunities
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:21.300]   for improved cost economics as you move into a schedule
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.680]   that you may not think of.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.040]   You know, I think people generally think of projects
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.980]   as, you know, physical delay.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.820]   It's a cost increase, but that there are other elements
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.720]   that work here on the offshore wind business that offset that.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.120]   >> How about any negatives?
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.560]   Do you lose any tax credits or anything else?
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.000]   I guess just time value?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.400]   >> Yes. In terms of the schedules we're looking at,
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.940]   we don't expect to have any impact on our tax assumptions.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.820]   But certainly significant delays.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.220]   Delays could have impacts on your tax assumption.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:07.720]   Delays could also have impacts on contracts that you have
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.760]   with counterparties, but in our specific case,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.120]   so that's the general case.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.960]   In our specific case, we're confident that we have the ability
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.000]   to work within both of those, the tax area
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.760]   and the contract area, in an effective way
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:31.200]   with where we see the schedules going in the future.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:31.940]   >> Okay.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.600]   >> Thank you.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.540]   >> Thank you.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.880]   Our next question is from Angie from Seaport Global.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.320]   Good morning, Angie.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.720]   >> Good morning.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   So I have a question about Massachusetts.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:51.420]   You have had this very constructive decision for ENSAR gas,
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.800]   but the state is clearly looking
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.640]   at the future of gas LDCs.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.900]   And so how do you guys see it, especially in light
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.240]   of the fact that you just acquired an additional gas
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.380]   utility in Massachusetts?
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.720]   >> Good morning, Angie, and thank you for your question
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.280]   and hope you're doing well.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:19.820]   You know, the way that I was positionated or the way
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.360]   that I think people should think about it is that there's nobody,
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.600]   first of all, who's more aggressive in terms of looking
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.040]   at clean energy strategies and carbon reduction
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.880]   than ever source in terms of having carbon neutral goals like 2030.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.980]   We have worked effectively with all parties in all states,
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.180]   but in Massachusetts where the Attorney General
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:49.480]   and others want to take a look at, you know, sort of the future
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.820]   or the outlook in terms of the gas business.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:57.260]   We've been working with these intervening parties
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.760]   for many years, and we'll continue to work with them
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.140]   on what we think an appropriate strategy is there.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:10.240]   So this is a long-term outlook in terms
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.940]   of that the state wants to, you know,
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:19.120]   have aggressive clean energy and carbon reduction targets
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.620]   with wholly supportive of that, and we look forward to working,
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.920]   you know, with all the parties there.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.460]   But we don't see it as a threat
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:34.140]   to the gas distribution business in the region at all.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:40.140]   >> Okay. And in Connecticut, you know, this recent back
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.480]   and forth between you guys and Pora about the expansion
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.920]   of the lack of basically disconnections on the back of COVID,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:54.080]   I mean, it sounds a bit concerning that Pora is pushing
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.880]   back so strong that they don't need to sign
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.660]   off on that extension.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.220]   I mean, I would assume that it's an actual practice,
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:05.300]   normal practice for a regulated utility to seek a recovery
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.960]   of these, you know, under-recovered revenues.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.300]   I mean, can you give us a sense, you know,
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:16.240]   how you see it in Connecticut given the latest, you know,
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.040]   legislative changes and also some deterioration
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.880]   and, you know, negative relationships in the state?
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:29.580]   >> Yes. So we are not doing shutoffs across all,
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.920]   any of our franchises at this point.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.020]   And specifically, you know, we're working,
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.220]   you know, we're working with customers.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:41.600]   We're working with fuel agencies, assistance agencies
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.060]   on an approach here that works,
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.500]   that work best for customers.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.940]   We've also engaged with Pora, as you mentioned,
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.940]   and other government officials, you know, on this issue.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.380]   So I'm confident that we'll get to a good place here.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.820]   You know, nobody wants to burden customers with any more
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.560]   than we're all ready, all of us are burdened with in terms
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.060]   of the economic conditions and COVID, et cetera.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.500]   So we're working through the issue.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.560]   We're working with customers, as I say,
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:20.380]   and some of the assistance agencies, and I'm sure we'll
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.980]   get to a good outcome here.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.580]   >> Very good.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.080]   Thank you.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.580]   >> Thank you, Angie.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.220]   Next question is from Julian from Bank of America.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.120]   Good morning, Julian.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.580]   >> Hey, good morning, team.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.880]   Thanks for the time.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.660]   I hope all of you are doing well and safe in families as well.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.860]   Perhaps just to pick up off of, or perhaps clarify if I can,
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.400]   some of the last rounds of questions, when you talk
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.200]   about the 4Q roll forward, are you going to be rolling to 2025
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.700]   and then more specifically, how do you think about including
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.840]   or excluding offshore wind in light
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.620]   of the uncertainty described?
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.180]   Should we expect that offshore wind should continue to be
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.960]   at least for those projects
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.520]   where there's an undetermined date to continue
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.120]   to be excluded there?
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.560]   >> Julian, thanks for your question and your comments
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.120]   that I hope you and your family are doing well too.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:20.360]   Just to clarify, our history has been to add another year
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.640]   into the outlook, so 2025 would be that year
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.040]   since our forecast goes through the 2024 time period,
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.680]   so that is something that you should expect to see.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.280]   And really our view on how to look at offshore wind,
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:40.480]   it doesn't change by any of the schedule items we talked
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.260]   about today, or we've looked at it
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:49.700]   as showing the core business as the driver
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.160]   and the foundational element of the growth rate
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.140]   and then to show that wind is additive to that in what way.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.580]   So that would be the intent going forward.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.740]   I think that what I've been asked this question before,
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:11.580]   the answer is was and still is as more years of wind come
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:15.220]   in to the actual results of that particular year,
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:19.220]   then to me it makes more sense to roll it all together.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.060]   But at this stage, the expectation especially
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.900]   in this upcoming February update would be
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:31.100]   to have the core business extend that through 2025
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:37.920]   and then show offshore wind in addition to that.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.620]   >> And if you don't mind elaborating a little bit further,
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.520]   I know that there's a certain degree of uncertainty
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.220]   on exactly the perming schedule that inhibits your ability
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.460]   to say when these projects are reaching service.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.160]   Can you at least try to put some more parameters
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.960]   around what each of these pieces of the process could take,
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.160]   such that there's like a window if you will?
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.940]   It may be too early.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.900]   >> Yeah, so in terms of, you know,
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:09.480]   people have realized out there and we've been asked questions.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:14.320]   I think you've asked us the questions in terms of, you know,
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.280]   with delays on vineyard wind and other things,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.720]   there's been some delays in terms of bone notice of intent
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.060]   and to prepare their environmental impact statement
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:33.100]   and frankly we would have expected in our original schedule
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.660]   that some of these NOIs, you know,
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.540]   to prepare the environmental impact statement
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.500]   would be out by now.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.440]   So these are expected I believe, you know,
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:51.380]   the plan schedule for reviewing and releasing these is underway.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.580]   So I wouldn't expect, you know,
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.820]   a significant change in the schedule
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:00.020]   but at this stage it would be prudent to wait
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.420]   to see that the schedule that comes out of the phone
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.860]   before we commit to a final in service date.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.260]   I wouldn't expect it to be significant.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.300]   >> Got it, excellent.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.440]   All right, I'll pass it from there.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.940]   Thank you so much, Steve.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.240]   >> Thanks, Julian.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.140]   Next question is from Durgash from Evercore.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.540]   Good morning, Durgash.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.980]   >> Hey, good morning, guys.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.580]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:32.660]   Just following up on, you know, the offshore wind here,
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:37.720]   what do you expect, you know, there's this EIS decision,
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.200]   I suppose, that is going to be out or EIS tape
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.900]   and rather this month or early December.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.960]   What do you expect there
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.840]   and then how does that impact your future project timelines?
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:57.980]   >> Yeah, the notice of intense, they contain a plan schedule,
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:02.620]   you know, that in the NOIs they have contained phones plan
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.260]   schedule for reviewing each of the cops.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.020]   So that would be an important piece of information
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.300]   to have available.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.100]   So that's really what's included in that.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.600]   It's a plan schedule for reviewing the cops that comes
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.700]   out with the notice of intense.
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.480]   >> Right, so I guess maybe I'm talking
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.840]   about the environmental impact statement.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.580]   Isn't there an environmental impact statement
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:30.320]   that Bohm is supposed to sort of put out here
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.460]   in the next few weeks?
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.960]   >> You're talking about the one for Vineyard, right?
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.460]   >> Yes. Yes, yes.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.100]   >> Oh, okay, yeah, I'm not.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:47.200]   I apologize, you probably have to ask Vineyard Wind
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.800]   about that.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.680]   >> Okay, but that doesn't have a read through for you
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.280]   or your offshore wind project.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:57.320]   I guess that's sort of what my question was.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:02.020]   >> Well, certainly all of the developers off the coast,
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.080]   you know, that we've been going through this cumulative impact
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:12.060]   study and looking at spacing of wind turbines and we came
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:16.800]   up with one nautical mile by one nautical mile spacing.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.540]   So certainly there could be components that come out
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:25.580]   in any decision for Vineyard Wind that you'd have to, you know,
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.780]   take a look at see if it has any impacts, you know,
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.420]   to all the developers including us.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.780]   But in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing,
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.560]   I think Vineyard might have a better perspective of that.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.860]   >> Okay, perfect.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.160]   That's all I had guys.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.460]   Thank you so much.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.060]   >> Thank you, Dr. Gash.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.300]   Next question is from Jeremy from J.P. Morgan.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.580]   Good morning, Jeremy.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.880]   >> Good morning.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.780]   Thanks for having me.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.940]   Just wanted to start off with what are the benefits
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:04.980]   of looping ConEd into the proposed Sunrise Wind 2 RFP here?
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.260]   Every source has the experience of building transmission
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.660]   and we're curious what additional competitive advantages
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.760]   ConEd provides here to this specific project.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.700]   Can you provide details on potential ownership interests
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.860]   for each entity and does ownership interest change
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.740]   once construction is complete and the project is in service?
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.300]   >> Thanks for your question, Jeremy.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.040]   Hope you're doing well.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.180]   I guess I would say on the first part of the question
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:38.480]   that sort of obviously ConEd has local knowledge of New York
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.680]   and their service territory and the network and the operation
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:49.360]   of the transmission and delivery system that are valuable
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.000]   to any party if you're operating in New York.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.260]   So I'd say they bring a knowledge and skill set of the area
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:05.300]   that certainly we don't have as depth a knowledge as they would.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:11.980]   So certain skill sets there that the local player would bring.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.980]   So in terms of, you know, what the components
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:22.160]   of a relationship would be, those things are all to be discussed
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.420]   as we move through but it's certainly beneficial I think
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.760]   to the project and have somebody
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.600]   with ConEd skill sets involved.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.940]   >> Got it, and as far as potential ownership interests,
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.340]   is there any kind of thoughts on how that could develop?
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:50.020]   >> Not at this time, no.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.320]   >> Got it.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.060]   And then will the delay in offshore wind permitting have any
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.120]   impact on the current financing plans?
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.660]   Is it fair to assume the 700 million of equity
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.860]   in your current private plan moves to the back end here
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.340]   and how is offshore wind catbacks spending track feeder date
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:14.200]   versus the 300 to 400 million range that you expected?
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.780]   >> We haven't disclosed a range that we've expected.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.680]   We've talked about how much we expected to spend, you know,
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:28.580]   this year, you know, you know, just for the year 2020.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.920]   And it's tracking somewhat close
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.720]   that I'd say is probably a little bit under what we expected
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.660]   at this time.
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:42.600]   In terms of the financing, you're right that we announced
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.300]   a year ago, you know, this $2 billion of equity need
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.000]   that would support the forecast.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.440]   And we issued 1.3 of that, so this 700 million remaining
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.280]   that and I would say the same thing as I said all along
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.220]   as we'd be opportunistic and consider what our capital
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.960]   forecasts are and what the market conditions are, you know,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:12.560]   as we look to fulfill the rest of that offering
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.960]   that we discussed.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.900]   >> Got it. That's helpful.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.500]   I'll leave it there.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.600]   Thank you.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.400]   >> Okay. Thanks, Jeremy.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.900]   Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.600]   Good morning, Paul.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.080]   >> Good morning, guys.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.580]   >> Good morning, Paul.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:33.780]   I just wanted to follow up on the draft decision
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:39.620]   in Connecticut on Monday and what your thoughts were on it?
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:43.700]   If it were, in fact, to become a final order,
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:48.900]   what the potential impact could be?
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.800]   >> Are you talking about the draft information on rates
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.880]   or can you be more specific?
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.840]   >> Sure. There was a draft decision on Monday
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.220]   in the per case associated with the rates, right?
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.880]   The rate review that was reversed, that proceeding,
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.680]   I can tell you the specific name.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.960]   >> No, that's okay.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.320]   You know, I just wanted to be specific
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.760]   because as somebody else mentioned,
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.900]   there's been a number of different--
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.100]   >> Yeah, I can answer a lot.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:30.500]   >> So, as you recall, the purest suspended the rates
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.940]   that we had implemented over the summer both we
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.680]   and UI to take an additional look.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.520]   I think this is what you're referring to.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.320]   So, we did receive the draft order
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.280]   and really it's kind of hot off the press
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:48.660]   we're currently evaluating that and we're going to, you know,
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.120]   see what comments we might have and comments
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.760]   on the draft could do.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.000]   I think it's the 12th of November,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.140]   so we have some time to flush out anything.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.740]   But it's consistent with, on first blush, I'd say,
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.280]   it's consistent with the purest desire
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.380]   to have some rate changes, you know,
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.980]   instead of implementing rates at peak times of usage,
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.660]   maybe such as July implement them on, you know,
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.060]   change the time of it to implement it maybe
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:25.060]   in our shoulder month like May or something
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.460]   and move to annual reconciliations
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.340]   as opposed to semi-annual.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:34.740]   So, this would, you know, it is delayed.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:38.480]   This could have effectively, this is a cash flow item
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.080]   and it could have an impact on our deferrals
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.880]   that we have in place there.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.880]   But, you know, I think it generally is consistent
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.880]   with the desire, as we said, to move off of these peak periods
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.260]   for making rate changes into shoulder periods
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.860]   and see what we go from there.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:01.320]   But we're actively reviewing that last night and today
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.560]   and we will be, and have any comments
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.640]   that we would have to do, as I said, on the 12th.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.600]   >> Okay. There was one part of it that would reduce
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:17.180]   the carrying charges from lack to a prime rate
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.880]   on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.820]   Is there any -- do we have any --
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.260]   I know this is off the press and everything,
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.360]   but do we have any sort of forecast as to what the --
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.860]   those reconciliation mechanisms, like how much capital might be
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.460]   tied up in those?
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:44.940]   >> No. That is a point too, the carrying cost at prime,
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.280]   which is consistent in some of the jurisdictions, I guess.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:55.340]   So, no, it's not a significant, you know, item,
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:59.620]   but it's certainly one that Pure had put out there
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.680]   in the draft is to recover the deferred balances
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:08.000]   with a prime rate versus a lack.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.360]   >> Okay. And then just -- we don't know
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.340]   who the President is going to be at scenes,
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.540]   but if there was a change in administration,
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.780]   do you think that could have or not have maybe
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:25.720]   a significant impact on the BOEM permitting process
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.920]   with respect to offshore wind?
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.560]   >> The permitting process, I mean, when we meet
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:40.260]   with all BOEM, you know, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.400]   you know, that people are active.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.040]   We're actively working, we're actively having, you know,
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:55.080]   Zoom meetings or Teams calls or whatever the video capabilities
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.380]   are that we're using.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.640]   But, you know, we're actively working that,
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.380]   and I can assure you that the people in the agencies
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:06.380]   are working full speed regardless of, you know,
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:10.860]   whose, you know, President or what the election results are.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:14.460]   But certainly, it would be good to have, you know,
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.500]   the results of the election.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.900]   I think we've all, as a country, you know,
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.040]   that the election results are something
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.700]   that we've all targeted out there.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.780]   And wherever you fall on the political spectrum,
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.940]   it's good to have certainty as opposed to uncertainty.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.440]   So I think we're all looking forward
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.120]   to what the final outcome is there so we can move forward.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.760]   >> Okay. This is for my clarity.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.220]   The process at the BOEM is pretty much the agency,
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.800]   sort of the bureaucratic process that's going on.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.060]   Really, you don't see a significant change
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.800]   one way or the other, regardless of the outcome
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.940]   of the presidential election.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:56.900]   Is that the right understanding there?
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.700]   >> Yeah, I'd say that the work
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.740]   at the agencies is going on.
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.740]   You know, there, you know, we've been meeting regularly,
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.880]   going through questions.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.420]   We're working through the various state agencies.
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.680]   So no, I'd say that the work is continuing
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.420]   at the, as you say, the bureaucrat level.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.560]   >> Okay, awesome.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.800]   Thanks so much.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.200]   Thanks Paul.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.760]   Next question is from Mike Weinstein
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.760]   from Credit Suisse.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.760]   Good morning Mike.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.900]   >> Hey, good morning.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.400]   Morning Phil.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.300]   >> Good morning Mike.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.440]   >> All right, good.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.580]   I hope you're doing well.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.640]   Hey, maybe you could just give a quick two second update
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.880]   on what you think the outcome at FERC might be
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.780]   for transmission ROEs, you know, considering, I don't know,
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.260]   if the election outcome maybe has any effect
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.760]   on any of this accelerating an outcome.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:59.300]   >> Well Mike, that's a very big crystal ball
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.760]   that you're asking.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.000]   So, but again, thanks and I hope you're doing well.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.900]   Thanks for your question.
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:12.040]   I, you know, it's, I wish I had a, you know,
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.180]   a better answer than to say that, you know,
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.780]   it's working its way through.
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:25.820]   We don't really have a specific clarity as to when FERC might,
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.220]   you know, come up with something on the New England before
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:33.800]   pending New England cases and certainly impact
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.000]   of the election one way or the other, what that could have
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.240]   in terms of commissioners and that type of thing.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.780]   So, you know, the only thing I know for certain
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:49.940]   is we're looking at our 10.57 rates and observing
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:55.220]   to that level and an 11.74 cap.
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.260]   And, you know, we'll just have to wait and see
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.220]   what the final, the final outcome we'll look at.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.400]   But I don't really have any answer.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.900]   I know in years past when I tried it, when I tried to think
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.540]   that one was coming or it was going a certain way,
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.240]   it really hadn't, hasn't materialized.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.580]   So, I think it's best to wait for the final,
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:17.500]   the final order comes out at this point on board
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.240]   or as it may be.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:25.280]   >> Right. And a bigger crystal ball question would be,
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.580]   you know, I know that Hydra Quebec has a pretty big long term
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:33.320]   construction plan for, you know, hydro generation up there.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.060]   And I know that their long term plans included lots
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.900]   and lots of northern past type transmission lines.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.500]   You know, do you think there's ever a time at some point
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.660]   where there might be another, another whack or another go
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.140]   at transmission at some point, you know,
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.740]   a big transmission project?
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.540]   >> I think a lot of that is dependent
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.780]   upon what the states want to get, right?
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.540]   So, these are going to be processes now that are driven
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:01.920]   by states' clean energy policies and the states' desire
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:11.160]   to have either offshore wind or solar or hydro in the mix.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:15.200]   So, you know, there are certainly --
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.260]   there's a lot of activity at the states now.
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:23.940]   I mean, the states in our area all want aggressive carbon
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.240]   reduction targets.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.340]   We wouldn't be out of the question to see if states, you know,
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.940]   want to, you know, contract for more of that.
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.020]   But there's nothing planned on our end.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.820]   There's nothing that I see at this stage
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.020]   on the states agenda that would say that.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:44.760]   But when you say the word "ever," you know, that's a long time.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.060]   >> So, it seems like the offshore wind program really is kind
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:51.060]   of supplanted that, at least at the time being.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:55.700]   Yeah, I think that's a good way of looking at it.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.700]   >> Okay, great.
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.180]   Thank you very much.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:58.700]   >> Okay, Mike.
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.780]   >> Thanks, Mike.
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:03.580]   Our next question is from Insu Kim from Goldman Sachs.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.620]   Good morning, Insu.
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.920]   >> Good morning, guys.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.580]   My only question is -- and apologies if I missed this,
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:13.320]   but could you give just an update on the Connecticut grid mark
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.860]   filings and any updates on expected decisions
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:19.260]   from the commission and, you know, timing of investments,
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.200]   et cetera?
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.760]   >> Thanks for your question, Insu.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.340]   And I hope you and your family are doing well.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.940]   You didn't miss it.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:32.480]   I mentioned, you know, in terms of what items could be additive
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.440]   to our 5% to 7% core business growth rate.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:40.680]   I alluded to grid mark in Connecticut or New Hampshire
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:49.420]   or potentially additional AMI dockets in Massachusetts.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.420]   But there's really been no change there.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:57.860]   We -- all the parties filed comments and plans back in July.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.200]   And certainly you can understand there's been a lot --
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.400]   there's been a lot going on.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.000]   And I think I may have said East IEIS was in October,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.980]   but we all know that East IEIS was in August.
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:13.480]   So since August, there's been a lot of, you know --
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.020]   there's been a lot of focus on storms.
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.220]   There's been a lot of dockets.
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:20.960]   And as somebody else mentioned, we have dockets going on
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.760]   in terms of moratoriums and whatnot.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.700]   So this -- you know, the expectation was there was going
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:32.540]   to be another sort of go round and another process
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.800]   in Connecticut towards the end of the year.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.240]   I really haven't seen anything that would indicate
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.520]   a specific schedule, you know, on that.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.880]   So I guess our best guess is still, you know,
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.860]   it's still in the pipeline and you may see more activity
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:51.360]   on grid lines there in Connecticut
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.800]   as we move over the next several months.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:59.600]   But in terms of being in our forecast, you know,
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.100]   I want to be clear that there is currently no, you know, zero.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:08.700]   There's no grid bond spending in our capital forecast
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.840]   for any, you know, grid bond programs
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.720]   that haven't been approved, like in Connecticut or New Hampshire.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.320]   So, you know, once they are approved
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:22.020]   and once we see what our role would be in them
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.420]   and once we see what that, you know, looks like,
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:27.900]   then we have more confidence in putting in the plan.
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.700]   So that could be something we have information on
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:35.040]   by the time we get to the February update.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:41.140]   So, you know, we'll have to stay tuned on that.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.240]   >> That makes sense.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.040]   That's all I had.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.640]   Thank you, guys, and stay safe.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.800]   >> All right, you do.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.580]   Thanks, Andrew.
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.940]   Next question is from David Arcaro
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.080]   from Morgan Stanley.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.940]   Morning, David.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:52.780]   >> Morning. Hi, Jeff.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.720]   Hi, Phil. Thanks so much for taking my question.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.920]   >> Thanks.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:01.260]   >> And a quick follow-up on offshore wind, you know,
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.320]   in light of some of the recent delays,
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:06.600]   I was wondering if that changes how you're strategizing
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:11.160]   around other bids that you're putting into future RFPs,
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.500]   like baking in more contingency,
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.140]   anything that might give a greater level of comfort
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.700]   around the economic future projects that you might win.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.940]   >> Thank you, Dave, for your comment,
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:26.480]   and I hope you are able to do it well.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:31.180]   Certainly, every piece of information that you get
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:34.260]   and this isn't just offshore wind, you know,
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.560]   this is, you know, on all our business,
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.460]   but I'll focus on offshore wind since that's the question.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.000]   You know, every month it goes by, every quarter it goes by,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.600]   we gain more insight and information about construction,
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:53.880]   about, you know, rates, about, you know,
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.840]   lots of factors, if all of those things,
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.920]   all of those things are factored into subsequent bids.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:03.460]   So the information that we have available to us,
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.860]   you know, as we're moving into a bid,
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.920]   a recent bid in New York is different than we had
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.820]   from bids that we made, you know,
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:13.000]   in Rhode Island or Connecticut or Massachusetts.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.800]   So every data point is important to us
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.040]   and we factor that into the next bid.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.640]   So I'd say that absolutely that schedules
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.940]   and how you make it through the fighting process
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:31.960]   and all of that informs, you know, subsequent bids
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:37.580]   and so I can assure you that all those things get, you know,
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:42.360]   up to the minute attention before bid goes in.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.660]   >> Okay, got it.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:47.300]   That's helpful and I just wanted to touch on just O&M costs
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.760]   and the O&M budget.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.740]   Could you remind us how you see that trajectory just
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.600]   from the overall business going forward?
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.680]   You've got a great track record of controlling O&M.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:03.680]   So what are the key levers in your tool belt field
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:08.920]   that you would focus on going forward for managing O&M?
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:13.960]   >> You know, we've got people processing technology, right?
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:17.700]   So all those things are levers to help, you know,
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:21.000]   our capital program as well as our operating program.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:28.280]   So, you know, we continue to implement systems and technology
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:32.640]   that improves processes that makes it more effective,
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.240]   you know, efficient and effective work force.
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:41.620]   So we have, you know, still a robust, I'd say, series
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.320]   of technology improvements.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:48.720]   If you -- I'll start off by just setting this page.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.700]   In the guidance we gave, we said that we expected O&M costs
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.200]   to be, you know, down this year and then just
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:00.740]   for the forecast period kind of flat going forward.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.280]   So how are we able to do that?
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.120]   It is by some of these technology changes
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:11.420]   and we've been implementing more productivity management tools
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.360]   and tools for our, you know, individual line workers
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:20.800]   and gas bidders in the field to get their work, to update their work
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.200]   that we can then take that
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.060]   and automatically update drawings and files.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.940]   We don't need, you know, to hand it off to somebody.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:33.000]   So there's still these productivity technology changes
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.480]   that are happening some went in last year,
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.540]   some going in this year and more planned for next.
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:44.080]   So that will be, I'd say, the lever underneath the underpinning
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:48.360]   for us to have the ability to continue to improve processes
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:53.960]   and take unneeded cost out of the business.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.460]   >> Okay, great.
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:54.960]   That's helpful.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.900]   Thanks so much for the call.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:57.400]   >> You're welcome.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.400]   >> Thank you, David.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:03.200]   Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.780]   Morning, Travis.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:05.280]   >> Good morning.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.840]   Thank you.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.980]   >> Quick clarification on the storm cost.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:14.040]   That $275 million number, if I heard you correctly.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.180]   How much did you expense in the quarter
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:20.880]   and how much was either deferred or capitalized
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:24.760]   or will be pending that the regulatory filing
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.360]   that you mentioned?
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:32.720]   >> Travis, that amount that you repeated was deferred.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.360]   That's how much of a storm cost that we deferred
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:40.940]   in the tropical storm [inaudible]
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.800]   and that was across all states
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.580]   but primarily in Connecticut.
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:48.140]   So that's our deferral.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:50.720]   That would be, you know, once the storm gets
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.120]   to a certain level it triggers a deferral.
[00:59:54.120 --> 01:00:00.160]   So we -- that fall is deferred storm cost right now.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.720]   In terms of -- there are other storms.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.600]   Certainly we had an active quarter for storms in general
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.000]   but there are other storms other than these ideas
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.960]   that did impact the quarter.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.240]   I mean, our storm costs were up, you know,
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.140]   about $10 million for the quarter that went through,
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:24.780]   you know, our -- oh, and now for the quarter it's at that level
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:29.920]   and then the 274 or 5 that you mentioned is deferred
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.220]   across the system.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:32.860]   >> Okay, great.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:33.920]   That's very helpful.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.820]   Thank you.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.200]   And then a quick follow-up to the discussion
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.800]   on the Connecticut legislation and there's some language
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.560]   in there as I understood it about the General Assembly having
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.860]   some review power there.
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.840]   What's your thought in terms of the scope
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.480]   of what the General Assembly separate from Pura could do
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.180]   in terms of either taking back some earnings
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.640]   or rate changes, stuff like that separate
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.980]   from what's going on in the Pura?
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.360]   >> Well, certainly the General Assembly can enact legislation
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.760]   that it feels is appropriate in any matter.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.960]   So, you know, I do think specifically
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.640]   to the energy legislation that was enacted recently
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:27.400]   in Connecticut that most, you know, things all were,
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.080]   you know, for the most part moved to Pura, you know,
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.040]   so the regulator.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.280]   So the -- I guess I'd look at it as the legislation would provide
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.120]   the intent, the framework, the direction,
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.320]   and then Pura is the one who's going to be implementing,
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.060]   you know, they're going to be the ones who evaluate
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.520]   the performance-based rates.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.260]   They'll be the ones who initiate the storm, you know,
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.000]   standards and things like that and look at, you know,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.800]   should there be penalties or should there be food,
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.000]   you know, penalties and things like that.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.480]   So I think that effectively, you know,
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.280]   the General Assembly can certainly enact any
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.540]   in all legislation it feels it should.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.320]   And the way that this legislation seems to have turned
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.460]   out was that any implementation
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:23.060]   of that legislation is in the hands of Pura.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:26.260]   >> Okay. So the potential for any or the risk for any kind
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.160]   of clawbacks would likely go through Pura instead of going
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.360]   through the General Assembly based on that kind
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.540]   of legislation that you talked about, right?
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.480]   >> Yeah, as I say, you know, the Pura --
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:44.080]   the dockets are active in -- will be active over, you know,
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.280]   there's a certain time date that the legislation has given Pura.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.320]   So I would expect that Pura will have the pen on this.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.160]   But again, as I say, you know, legislation can always be
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.900]   enacted in any -- in any area.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.160]   >> Yep. Okay.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.340]   Great. Appreciate it.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:06.880]   >> All right.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.080]   Thank you, Travis.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.040]   Our next question is from Andrew Weisel from SCOSHA.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.480]   Good morning, Andrew.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   >> Hey, good morning.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.880]   Thanks for squeezing me in.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.820]   First question is, with the two rate cases now completed,
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.080]   can you remind us which subsidiaries might be next
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.760]   to file general rate cases?
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.700]   We have plenty of regulatory items, of course,
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.160]   with GridMod and other initiatives,
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.660]   but for general rate cases?
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:41.100]   >> Well, according to the requirements in Connecticut,
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:46.140]   Connecticut could be an area that is required to file
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:50.140]   by the existing framework that's there.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:54.380]   And that would be something that would be sort of a, you know,
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.980]   next year sort of event.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:03.360]   But other than that, we're pretty much out of the regulatory arena.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.660]   >> Okay. Great.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:08.660]   Then on offshore winds, can you just thinking --
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.740]   sorry, can you share your latest thinking
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:13.740]   on how big you're willing to let that business get?
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.600]   You talked a lot about the opportunities
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.540]   that you're pursuing beyond the three existing projects.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:22.620]   Any thinking as far as from an earnings mix perspective,
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.380]   if there's a limitation, or will you plan
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.580]   to just bid, bid, bid and get as many projects
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.220]   as your leases will support?
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.460]   >> Well, I want to be clear on this
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.780]   because I think it's a very important point
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:39.220]   that bid, bid, bid isn't that strategy.
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:43.380]   Our strategy is to have a financial discipline
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.180]   about growing that business in a way
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:48.380]   that provides appropriate levels of returns
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:50.780]   that benefit our shareholders.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:55.420]   So just by winning a bid, you know, doesn't do it.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.980]   It has to be -- we have to and we continue
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.660]   to maintain financial discipline in terms
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.580]   of the amounts that we did and the returns
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.900]   that we're looking for.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:10.020]   So as long as the returns are at an appropriate level
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:14.860]   for that business, it makes sense to make the bid,
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:19.980]   win the bid and expand the business there.
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:25.580]   What we've said is our tracks, what we own off the coast
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:29.660]   of what we have access to in terms of the lease areas,
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.180]   you know, we could do about 4,000,
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.540]   at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.020]   So there's kind of a, you know,
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:40.420]   that's the maximum capability that we have.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:44.460]   So it's not an infinite growth type of thing
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:49.420]   and we had indicated that when leases were available
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.540]   that are not in our region
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.620]   and we were not interested in them.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:57.140]   So leases in our region, like the ones who are involved
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.980]   in are good, but other lease areas, you know,
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:04.380]   that's not for us in other parts of the mid-Atlantic, et cetera.
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:07.500]   So we're constrained by the lease area
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:11.140]   and we're guided by the financial discipline
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:16.460]   to -- on our bids and our returns.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.540]   >> God, if that's really helpful.
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.460]   I guess I should have said bid, bid, bid responsibly.
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.300]   >> Okay, well, yeah.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.300]   >> Thank you so much, guys.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:30.460]   >> All right, Andrew, thank you very much.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.380]   That sort of wraps up today.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:37.060]   If you have any follow-up questions, please give us a call
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.380]   or send us an e-mail and we look forward to speaking
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:45.380]   and seeing many of you during the virtual EEI conference next week.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.620]   >> And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.140]   This concludes today's conference.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:56.180]   Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.580]   >> Thank you.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.820]   >> All right.
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:06:59.100]   >> Thank you.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SAG Third Quarter 2020
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Earnings Conference Call.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at the time.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your touchstone telephone.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Thank you.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Brandon Frey.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Please go ahead.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Thank you, Grace.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review SAG's Third Quarter 2020 financial results.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   On the call today, we have Chris Ahirm, Chief Executive Officer and Taylor Smith, Chief Financial Officer.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Following Chris and Taylor's prepared comments, we will open the call for a question and answer session.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Our Third Quarter earnings press release was issued today after the market closed at approximately 4.05 p.m. Eastern Time.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   As a follow-on to the earnings release, we published a supplemental financial information on our Investor Relations website.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   We also furnished this document to the SEC on Form 8.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   You can find all our earnings documents on our Investor Relations website at zag.com in the quarterly results section under the Financials tab.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   We are recording this call, and a podcast of the conference call will be archived at the Zag Investor Relations webpage under the Events tab for one year.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Before we begin, we would like to remind everyone that the prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   These statements include but are not limited to our outlook for the company and statements that estimate or project future results of operations for the performance of the company.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   These statements do not guarantee future performance and speak as of the date hereof.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   For more detailed discussion on the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from those projected any forward-looking statements,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   we refer all of you to the risk factors contained in Zag's annual report on Form 10(k) and quarterly reports on Form 10(q) by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Zag assumes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements that may be made in today's release or call.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Please note that on today's call, in addition to discussing the GAP financial results,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   we will discuss adjusted EBITDA non-GAP financial measure.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Explanation of Zag's use of this non-GAP financial measure in this call and reconciliation between GAP and non-GAP measures required by SEC Regulation G
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   is included in Zag's press release today, which again can be found on the Investor Relations website.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   The non-GAP information is not a substitute for any performance measure derived in accordance with GAP,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   and the use of such non-GAP measures has limitations which are detailed in the company's press release.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And now I would like to turn the call over to Chris Taher.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Thanks, Brendan, and thank you to everyone on today's call.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   We hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Firstly, let me start by thanking our entire Zag team across the globe.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I'm extremely proud to see how our teams reacted through the quarter,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and never last sight of serving our consumers and partners with quality products that protect and enhance their devices.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Over the course of the third quarter, it was pleasing to see our results improve significantly
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   compared with the second quarter and exceed our expectations.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   We are encouraged by our recent performance given the challenges we continue to face
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   from the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Our work over the past several months, which has included reducing expenses,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   adapting our operations to the current retail environment,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and aggressively managing inventories has put the company in a much stronger financial position
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and provided a business with good momentum as we head into our busiest selling season.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Looking at our third quarter in more detail, as we discussed on our Q2 call in August,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   we saw a significant sequential uptake in sales through in June
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   for both our protection and power categories,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   as several of our larger customers reopened our doors and resumed more normalised store operations,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   with some sales through weeks even exceeding last year's levels.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   This trend continued into July and consistently improved throughout August and September,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   while our online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced earlier in the pandemic,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   when much of the brick and mortar was closed, it was still up nicely from a year ago,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and expanding this channel continues to be a priority for us.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   With respect to our overall performance, Q3 revenue came in at $150 million,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   compared to $147 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 21%.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   This represents a nice improvement from the 28% year-over-year decrease in revenue
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   we reported in the second quarter.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Despite the roughly $32 million drop in revenue compared with the third quarter last year,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   combined with some gross margin headwinds from higher freight expenses,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $15 million.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Thanks to cost-saving measures, we enacted early in the pandemic.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Taylor will go through in greater detail on the balance sheet,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   but I wanted to share a few highlights.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Despite significant market pressure from COVID-19,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   our accounts receivable DSO has improved compared to last year,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   inventory decline compared to where we ended Q2,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   we generated positive operating cash flow,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and we continue to reduce our quarterly net-dead balance on a year-over-year
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   and sequential basis.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   By taking quick decisive action back in April,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and more recently working closely with our retail partners under store reopening efforts,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   we have been able to successfully navigate through incredibly challenging market conditions,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   ensuring the financial viability of the company
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and position ourselves to exit this difficult period as a stronger, more nimble organization.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I now provide some additional color to our categories.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Starting with protection,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   we continue to build on our overall digital wellness strategy.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   For a few years now, our hero screen protector has been Vision Guard,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   a product that reduced exposure to high-energy visible blue lights
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   that can have damaging effects without changing the screen colors or the peak resolution.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   We have now sold over 10 million units with this technology.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   In addition, all invisible scene screen protectors produced this year and beyond
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   now also include antimicrobial technology.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   This includes our entire lineup for the new iPhone 12, which is now available in stores.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Earlier this year, we introduced our newest product geared towards our digital wellness strategy,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   a UV phone sanitizer which works with all mobile devices
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and kills up to 99.9% of staff in E. coli surface bacteria.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   is resonating with retailers and our consumers
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and has led to increasing sales through and greater shelf space with many of our accounts.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   We've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to protect cases with good success
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   starting with the Samsung Galaxy S20 launch earlier this year
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   and right through to the recent iPhone 12 launch.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   All Gear 4 protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   The combination of disenhancement,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   benefit and Gear 4's differential D3O impact technology
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   is driving excitement amongst consumers,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   especially as awareness of the brand and products grow from our efforts to expand distribution.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   With the new iPhone 12, Gear 4 is now available
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   and growing across all of our carrier partners.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   This expanded distribution accelerates the momentum of Gear 4 brand
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and I'm excited to see it continue to grow through 2021.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   In our power category, Mofi launched many exciting new products during Q3
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   including the introduction of a new line of wireless charging solutions.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   These innovations are focused on providing the ability
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   to conveniently charge multiple devices in one central location.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   In addition, last month we launched the new Mofi Juice Pack Connect.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   This new product represents an evolution of our popular juice pack
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   allowing users to easily charge their phone on demand
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   using a detachable battery feature that is not device specific
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and is used with or without the consumer's normal phone case.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Our Halo brand continues to perform well on QVC
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   which has been a productive partnership and channel
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   particularly given the number of consumers spending more time at home.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Q4 is a busy time for our brand with QVC and HSN
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   with a number of earrings planned during the holiday period.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Looking ahead with the majority of our US partner doors now open
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   and weekly sales will continue to improve
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   combined with solid direct-to-consumer trends
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   we feel optimistic about our prospects for remainder of the year
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   while there is still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   shopping behaviour this holiday season
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   including the effect on several countries in Europe
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   that have recently implemented lockdowns
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   we believe we are well positioned to capitalise on demand
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   regardless of which channel our consumer chooses to engage with the brands.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   We are currently planning 4/4 revenue to increase from 3/4 levels
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   and continue improving on the year-over-year declines
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   we have experienced the past two quarters
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   even as we are facing tough comparisons to last year's record Q4 sales.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I am confident in the long-term course we have set for the company
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   our efforts around antimicrobial, UV sanitisation and blue light protection
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   are driven by our belief that consumers will increasingly look for solutions
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   that will hedge their digital wellness.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   We also believe another consumer priority will be increased productivity
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   and comfort from home.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   We will continue our focus on enhancing technology
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   in our lives to accomplish these growing needs.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   While it remains difficult to know when conditions will fully normalise
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   and what impact COVID-19 will have on the global economy in our industry
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I am confident that we have taken the right steps to emerge from the pandemic
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   as a stronger company.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   This includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin product
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   and categories and simplify our core lines of business.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   As a more nimble company,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Zac can better serve its retail partners and core consumers
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   capitalise on the tailwinds from the multi-year rollout of 5G
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   with the margin benefits from our branding category consolidation
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   and generate increased value for our shareholders.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   I will now hand the call over to Taylor.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Thanks Chris.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Since many details of our quarterly financial performance
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   were included in the supplemental financial information issued earlier today,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I would just like to take a few minutes to add some additional comments
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   in our third quarter financial performance.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Q3 net sales decreased year over year
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   by approximately 21% to $115 million.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   After exiting a very difficult second quarter
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   we saw good momentum throughout the third quarter
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   as retail outlets continued to reopen
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and allow a more normal in-store shopping experience.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   That being said, the residual effects of COVID-19
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   combined with the delay of the launch of the new Apple devices
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   which pushed some orders into Q4
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   made it a difficult year over year compare.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Overall, we are pleased with the momentum
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   and sell through improvements we saw at retail
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   which enabled us to increase sales by almost 50%
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   on a consecutive quarter basis from $77 million to $115 million.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Q3 gross profit as a percentage of net sales
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   decreased year over year to 33%.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   There were a number of puts and takes
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   that impacted gross profit during the quarter
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   including a benefit from net lower duty rates
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and expected duty refunds
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   which I'll discuss in more detail in a second.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   This benefit was offset by higher expedited air freight
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   and increased air freight rates
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   along with the sale of excess inventory at margins
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   that were lower than our historical averages.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   On the subjects of duty refunds
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   in early August we received an exclusion notice
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   that duties paid on certain products imported from China
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   starting in late 2018 may be subject to refund.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   We worked closely with our customs broker
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   to begin submitting refund documentation to U.S. Customs.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   This work is ongoing
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   and given the volume of imports from China since late 2018
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   we'll continue throughout the fourth quarter.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Based on the work completed to date
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   we recorded a refund receivable at quarter end
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   of approximately $5.4 million
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   for duties paid that we expect to be refunded.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The income statement impacted this receivable
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   offset by the balance sheet reduction
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   from duties previously capitalized in inventory
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   and then sold in Q3 2020
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   was a net income statement benefit of $1.7 million
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   or approximately 140 basis points
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   to gross profit margin during the quarter.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   As I mentioned
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   there is still quite a bit of work left to do
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   during the fourth quarter
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   to complete our remaining refund submissions
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and we'll provide an update
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   on any additional refund upside on our next call.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Q3 operating expenses decreased 29%
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   or approximately $12 million compared to last year.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   The decrease was due primarily to the various
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   cost cutting measures we implemented
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   as a result of the expected COVID-19 impacts on demand.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Over the last several months
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   we've made the conscious decision
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   to bring some individuals back from furlough
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   to support fourth quarter product launches
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   and customer care
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   but we continue to be focused on all spend
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult time.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Q3 adjusted EBITDAB's $15 million
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   versus 21 million in the prior year period.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   The decline versus last year is linked to decreased sales
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   and reduction in overall gross profit margin
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   for the reasons I mentioned.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   These items were offset by the decreases
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and operating expenses that I just discussed.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Turning to the balance sheet
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   compared to a year ago
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   accounts receivable decreased 33%
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   to $91 million
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   due to the reduction in sales
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   compared to the prior year period.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   However, our DSOs improved significantly
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   from 87 days to 73 days
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   the quality of our receivables remains very good.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Inventory was $80 million compared to $94 million
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   at the end of the first quarter
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   a reduction of approximately $14 million.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   During the third quarter
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   we took a conservative approach to inventory
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   as we closely monitored retail sell through
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   customer forecasts and customer inventory levels
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   to ensure we didn't overextend on inventory purchasing.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   As a result we did incur some incremental
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   expedited air freight charges
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   due to increased demand at the end of the third quarter
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   as retail sell through improved.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   At this point we will continue to closely monitor
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   the factors that influence our purchasing forecasts
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   but we'll continue to plan conservatively
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   due to the continued uncertainties
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Despite the continued headwinds
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   from COVID-19 during the quarter
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   we generated third quarter operating cash flow
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   of approximately $9 million
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   compared to negative $11 million in cash
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   from operations during the prior year period.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Net debt which is consolidated debt less cash
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   decreased to $81 million
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   compared to $97 million in Q3 last year
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and $85 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   As we discussed on the last call
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   during April we amended our credit facility
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   to increase the total amount available
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   under the line of credit from $125 million
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   to $145 million.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   This expansion combined with the loan
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   received under the CARES Act
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   the Q2 restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   we've undertaken gives us confidence
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   that we'll successfully navigate the headwinds
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   that COVID-19 has put on the business.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   The capital allocation focus throughout the remainder of 2020
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   will remain on funding working capital needs
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   and continuing to service our line of credit.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   As we look to the fourth quarter of 2020
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   we definitely have better visibility now
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   than we did when we last spoke in August.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   However, COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   around worldwide retail demand.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Given this market uncertainty
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   we will not be providing annual guidance at this time.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   However, given our current view of customer orders
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   and positive retail sell-through trends
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   we expect strong sequential net sales
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and adjusted EBITDA growth over the third quarter.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   We expect 2020 year to take gross margins
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   to improve during the fourth quarter.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Though as I mentioned
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   we'll see some pressure over the next few quarters
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   compared to historical averages
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   of mid-30s as we sell through our excess inventory.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   We expect total operating expenses
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   to be in the same range of high 20s
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   to low $30 million for the fourth quarter.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   No different than from many other companies
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   COVID-19 has been extremely disruptive to our business.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   However, with the steps we've taken
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   to restructure the business, reduce fixed costs
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and ensure adequate liquidity
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   I'm confident the likes of this period
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   impacted by COVID-19 is a much stronger company
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   than when we entered.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   With that we will now open up the call for questions.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Thank you ladies and gentlemen
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   if you have a question at this time
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   please press start in the number one key
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   on your touchdown telephone.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Again, that is start in the number one key
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   on your touchdown telephone.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Your first question comes from the line
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   of Elliott Alper from D.A. Davidson.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Your line is open.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Great, thank you.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   So thanks for the info on just the sequential sales
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   in the fourth quarter I guess.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Could you talk about any trends quarter date specifically
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   and specifically geographic sales mix
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   are you seeing any material changes
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   with sales and geographies that have lost restrictions
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   compared to those that have more?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Yeah, just a couple of notes.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   With the Apple launch happening
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   a little bit later than we had experienced previously
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   there was maybe $5 million of sales
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   that shifted from Q3 into Q4
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   which obviously benefit kind of the sequential look
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   at revenue.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Overall though we're seeing really good
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   sell through of the phones
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   that seem to be doing very successful in market
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   and obviously we're benefitting from that.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   So Q4 starting off really, really well.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   In terms of geos,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   no material change in geo expansion.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Chris mentioned or geo mix.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Chris mentioned on his prepared remarks
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   that we are definitely seeing some headwinds
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   at least in terms of shutdowns
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   in some of our international locations.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   However, the wireless dealers in those locations
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   have been deemed as essential
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   and so those have remained open
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   and so kind of remains to be seen
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   as to how that's going to impact demand
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   but I think overall we're definitely seeing
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   some strong signs
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   that we're kind of getting back
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   to a more normal Q4 experience
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   though obviously COVID remains
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   a bit of a cloud over everything.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Okay, great.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And then aside from the Apple launch
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   shifting into the fourth quarter
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   can you talk about the holiday season
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   and kind of what may be different this year
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   versus historically
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   what kind of any implication does that may have
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   on the December quarter?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Yeah, one thing that we are starting to see
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   is obviously the Black Friday seems to be more
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   some retailers are taking strategy
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   which are spreading us out over a number of days
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   over the month
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   so that's something that's going to be different.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I think we're still going to see a pretty strong
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   online attachment from both side.com
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   and obviously through Amazon
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   but we're very, I would say,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   optimistic about the early sales through
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   on our screen protection and cases
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   are quite strong
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   and that's given that we still have
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   a number of other devices to take the market
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   actually this week
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   so overall I think we have some good runway
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   for the holiday season, Elliot.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Okay, great.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Thank you.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Thank you.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Thanks Elliot.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And once again in order to ask a question
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   please press start then the number one
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   on your touchstone telephone.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Your next question comes from the line
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   of Matt Dain from Titan Capital Management.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Your line is open.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Great.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Thank you.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   I was hoping you could put a number
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   on the expediting shipping cost
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   that you incurred in the third quarter
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   just to give us some better idea
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   how much housing those were.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Yeah, it was between two and three million dollars
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   and as I mentioned
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   in my prepared remarks
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   we really, it was a bit of a balancing act
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   with inventory where we're trying to run it down
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   and sell through, picked up at the end
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   we did have to move quickly and unfortunately
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   resulted in some expedited air freight charges.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   And for the fourth quarter
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   are you expecting that to reoccur
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   or have you caught up
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   and you feel like you're in a better place now?
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   I think we're still probably chasing
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   a little bit of demand.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   The one thing that's also kind of impacted us
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   no different than every other company
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   that's importing from overseas
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   is just generally freight rates
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   have increased kind of globally
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   and so that's also impacted it.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   But I think there's probably going to be
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   a little bit of that.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   As I mentioned, it's a bit of a balancing act.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   We definitely wanted to be careful
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   given the pandemic
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   and how much inventory we were planning
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and fortunately or unfortunately
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   we've seen some upsides which is great
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   but we've had to chase those.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   So I think we're probably still chasing a little bit
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   which will impact some of our Q4 sales
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   and then also obviously the spend on freight.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Great.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I also wanted to ask if I could really quickly
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   about the tariff situation.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Now with a Biden presidency
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   I know you've been moving some production out of China.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Does that change your view
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   on moving production out of China
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   or how are you thinking about this new regime?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Yeah, I think Matt, it doesn't change our strategy.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Ultimately we're looking to diversify
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   across our CM base
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   and make sure that we're setting the company up
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   for continued business.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   So we're still following the strategy
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   and we've had a very good quarter
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   where we've now successfully have piloted
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   both screen protection and wireless power
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   outside of China.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   So it gives us that ability to be able to shift
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   our supply chain when needed.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Obviously China is still a big part of our strategy
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   but what I like is we're not just looking at it
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   from a tariff perspective now,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   we're really looking at it from a business continuity perspective.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Great.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Thank you both.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Thanks Matt.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Thanks Matt.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Thank you.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Once again, in order to pass a question
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   please press start in the number one
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   on your touch down telephone.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Gentlemen, I'm showing you for the question at this time.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   I would like to turn the conference back
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   to Mr. Chris in hearing from any closing remarks.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Thank you.
