[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monroe Inc. Earnings Conference Call
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.880]   for the third quarter fiscal 2020.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.160]   At this time, all participants are on a listen only mode.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.960]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960]   time.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.400]   If anyone should require assistance during the call, please press star zero on your
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.400]   touchtone phone.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.320]   As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded and may not be
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.720]   reproduced in whole or in part without permission from the company.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.480]   I would now like to introduce Ms. Maureen Mulholland, Senior Vice President, General
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.400]   Counsel and Secretary of Monroe.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   Thank you.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400]   Please go ahead.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.400]   Thank you.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.040]   Hello everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's call.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.680]   Before we get started, please note that as part of the call this morning, we will be
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.160]   referencing a presentation that is available on the Investors section of our website at
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.080]   corporate.monro.com/investors/investorresources.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.280]   If I could draw your attention to the safe harbor statement on slide two of the presentation,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.240]   I'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.280]   looking statements about Monroe's future performance.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.240]   Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.040]   The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monroe's filings
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.920]   with the SEC and in our earnings release.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.320]   The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.520]   whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   law.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.800]   Additionally, on today's call management statements include a discussion of certain non-gap financial
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.880]   measures which are intended to supplement and not be substitutes for comparable gap measures.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.180]   Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable gap measures will be included
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.600]   as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.420]   With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer,
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.420]   Brett Ponton.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.420]   Brett?
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.420]   Thank you, Maureen.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.000]   And good morning, everyone.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.400]   I'll get started today with a brief overview of our third quarter results followed by an
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.720]   update on the progress we've made on our Monroe forward strategy.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.780]   As illustrated on slide three, we reported comps down 0.9 percent in the third quarter
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.360]   as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.960]   In October and the beginning of November, we performed well against difficult comparisons
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.840]   in the prior year.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.440]   Solid weather conditions towards the end of November and in December caused a slowdown
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.760]   across our core northern markets.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.720]   These conditions have continued into January with our comparable store sales down 4 percent
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.720]   during the month.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.120]   We do not like talking about the weather; however, it is impossible to ignore the impact it has
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   on our business.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.360]   While we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter, we are executing well
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.720]   against the areas within our control.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   In particular, we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and are confident
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.800]   we are on the right path.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.040]   We are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.080]   deliver strong results no matter the external circumstances.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.600]   Moving on to our performance by category in the third quarter, we were down 1 percent
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.100]   year over year and entire comparable store sales.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.100]   As higher ticket year over year was offset by decline in tire volume.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.560]   We experienced more normalized retail pricing this quarter and are focused on further refining
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.840]   our tire strategy to drive strength in our largest category.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.100]   Importantly, we are on track to roll out our tire category management and pricing system
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.160]   beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.600]   approach to real time pricing.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.120]   All provide more details on this shortly.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.360]   Turning to our service and repair categories, we saw a 3 percent decline in brakes year
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.480]   over year, falling short of a difficult comparison in the third quarter last year.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.700]   In maintenance, we were flat while front end shocks were down 1 percent and alignments
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.760]   decline 3 percent year over year.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.600]   Overall, our southern markets outperformed our northern markets as expected given the
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.880]   mild winter weather conditions we faced in this region.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.400]   These stores added $22.7 million in revenue during the quarter including $20.7 million
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.760]   from recent acquisitions.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.960]   Regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter, we saw a decline of 20 basis
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.720]   points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.160]   sales which resulted in higher fixed cost at the percentage of sales.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.320]   Our variable margin on the other hand expanded due to lower year over year material cost
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.080]   as a percentage of sales.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.040]   While slightly higher than the prior year quarter, technician labor as a percentage
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.360]   of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.920]   This is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.040]   We identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.160]   action to drive improved results.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.340]   We will have additional opportunities to continue to improve results in this area as we implement
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.720]   our cloud based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.200]   which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust the changes and demand dynamics without
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.840]   sacrificing sales.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.520]   I now like to turn to the progress we made in our Monroe Forward Strategy beginning with
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.920]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative on slide four.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.120]   This initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.400]   standardized in-store operating procedures which we call our Monroe Playbook.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.180]   Additionally we are rebranding select stores to a tire oriented banner where targeted
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.760]   demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.120]   service revenues.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.600]   During the first half of fiscal 2020 we finalized the transformations of our first group of
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.960]   stores which includes 44 locations in Rochester New York and Mid-Atlantic as well as the second
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.160]   group which includes 43 stores in our southern markets.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.580]   During the third quarter we continue to scale this initiative across our base and move forward
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.760]   with the transformation of 74 stores in four markets and 42 of our recently acquired California
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.400]   stores.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.800]   We have completed the transformation of the 74 stores and have substantially completed
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.920]   our California stores which are being rebranded under our Tire Choice Auto Service Center
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.040]   to drive higher awareness for tires.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.480]   Turning to slide five I'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.200]   rationale as we transform our store base.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.520]   As many of you know we operate in two store formats.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.720]   Our service brand stores which generate approximately $600,000 per store in annualized sales and
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.080]   our tire brand stores which generate approximately $1.2 million per store in annualized sales.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.360]   Similar to any rebrand activity we operate 555 service brand stores and 734 tire brand
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.360]   stores and as we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores we are
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.880]   prioritizing the higher volume tire brand.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.040]   Throughout this process we will be consolidating our regional brands focusing on shifting our
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.600]   service brands over the tire brand.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.800]   The lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.320]   When we speak to re-imaging stores this primarily means modernizing the appearance of our stores
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.920]   with no associated brand change.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.040]   As we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re-imaging stores we are leveraging
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:15.400]   our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.120]   Looking at the bottom left of the slide you can see here the progress we have made so
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   far.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.360]   We are very much in the early innings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.080]   completed out of our portfolio.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.440]   We separated the stores out between comp stores and non-comp stores which helps us to evaluate
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.920]   their performance post refresh.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.880]   Of our approximately 900 comp stores that we set out to transform we have completed 134
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.240]   stores and of our approximately 150 non-comp stores we have substantially completed 69.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.080]   As we move forward with expanding this program across our base we will continue to prioritize
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.200]   those markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.680]   our approach we measure in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.520]   Through the end of this fiscal year we are focusing on finalizing the transformation
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.880]   of our recently acquired California stores while starting the transformation of approximately
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.480]   80 more stores that will be completed in Q1 of FY21.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.400]   Moving on to the performance of the stores we've completed so far to help provide some
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.800]   additional granularity we separated out how rebranded stores have performed versus the
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.360]   stores that have just been reimagined.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.200]   Importantly this data only includes comp stores that have had a full quarter of performance
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.240]   following the completion of their transformation.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:48.800]   This is how we will speak to this performance of our transformed stores moving forward.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.520]   As you can see and in line with our expectations we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520]   stores.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.680]   This shift optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sales without sacrificing
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.800]   our service revenues.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.380]   The stores that have been reimagined were slightly down as these are located in our
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:14.000]   northern markets which were impacted by the mild weather conditions I mentioned earlier.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.120]   We believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.760]   to come with a streamlined brand portfolio.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.800]   The 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation given
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:34.400]   they have not had a full quarter post transformation yet but we are seeing early signs of strength
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.560]   to these stores and are pleased with the results.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.840]   While we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base to sustain
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.920]   performance we have seen that the stores that have completed the transformation to date
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.160]   underscores the impact of this important initiative.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.280]   Turning to slide six and the remainder of our Monroe Forward initiatives I would like
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.560]   to focus my discussion on the initiatives that are top priority which we believe will
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.680]   be critical to supporting our broader strategy.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:10.580]   In the third quarter we began modernizing our store IT infrastructure at all of our approximately
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.040]   1300 locations.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.560]   This new infrastructure enables state of the art technology including our new digital phone
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.600]   and texting system which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.320]   This system will allow us to better track customer execution, drive in a more consistent phone
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.720]   strategy and improve conversions.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.480]   Our store infrastructure modernization will be completed by the end of the first quarter
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.840]   of fiscal 2021 allowing us to leverage our new phone system which will be critical to
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.040]   driving traffic to our stores.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.360]   Another priority for us is the optimization of our entire category management.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.640]   We are on track and by the end of this fiscal year we expect our new pricing software will
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.260]   be operational.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.440]   We believe this will be critical to driving long term margin expansion by providing improved
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.020]   visibility into demand dynamics allowing us to better refine our assortment and execute
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:12.840]   our strategy to become the number one destination for tires at any price point.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.240]   Finally we are right on track to roll out our cloud based or scheduling model pilot
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   by year end.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.000]   Getting real time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.080]   effective and strategic ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales or overstaffed
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.700]   when there is a lack of demand.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.480]   Regarding our other teammate initiatives we have rolled out the Monroe University program
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.760]   to all of our teammates and are continuing to expand and enhance the course content.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.600]   We've also implemented mandatory onboard training to ensure that everyone who joins
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.160]   our team is trained on our Monroe playbook operating procedures in order to provide
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.240]   a quality five star experience to our customers.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.040]   Going on to slide seven while we are very focused on the rollout of Monroe Forward acquisitions
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.240]   remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.600]   During the quarter we closed the previously announced acquisitions of three companies
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.080]   one with 14 locations in Las Vegas, Nevada and four in Boise, Idaho as well as two companies
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.280]   that include nine stores in Northern California further solidifying our growing position in
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.480]   the western United States.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.920]   Our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts as well as benefit
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.360]   from the high concentration of vehicles in this market and the potential long-term consumership
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.080]   to ride sharing.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.960]   The acquisition in Nevada and Idaho which are new states to Monroe is expected to add
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:43.160]   approximately 20 million in annualized sales representing sales mix of 75% service and
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.160]   25% tires.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.900]   The acquisitions in California are expected to add approximately 25 million in annualized
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:56.440]   sales representing sales mix of 55% service and 45% tires.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:04.200]   These acquisitions are expected to be diluted to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.520]   Overall acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent and
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.600]   expected 120 million in annualized sales.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.960]   We operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:24.320]   consolidation and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.800]   of attractive M&A targets.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.000]   We currently have over 10 NDA signed with opportunities ranging from 5 to 40 stores which we believe
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.520]   will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.840]   expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.120]   Further, by continuing to execute our Monroe forward initiatives including our new brand
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.720]   standards and operating procedures, we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   and efficiently.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.560]   Lastly, we open one greenfield location during third quarter bringing our total greenfield
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.260]   store openings to 7 in fiscal 2020.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.320]   In conclusion, we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.620]   our business.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.680]   We are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.440]   a platform capable of delivering sustainable long-term growth.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.880]   We are not there yet nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.600]   transformation but we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.600]   making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.280]   areas within our control.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.120]   I'd like to thank the entire team at Monroe for their exceptional work as we execute this
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.720]   strategy as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.840]   With that, I'll turn the call over to our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.960]   and Treasurer Brian Deenbrosia who will provide additional detail on our third quarter financial
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.360]   performance and fiscal 2020 outlook.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.720]   Thank you, Brett and good morning everyone.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.420]   Turning to slide 8 in our performance during the quarter, sales increased 6.2% year over
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:16.680]   year to $329.3 million driven by sales from new stores of $22.7 million including $20.7
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.960]   million from recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.000]   stores of approximately $0.8 million.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.040]   Time-store sales in the quarter were down 0.9% year over year.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:37.560]   The third quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days in line with the previous year period.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:45.560]   Rose margin decreased 20 basis points to 37.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 from 38%
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.600]   in the prior year period.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.560]   This decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy cost as a percentage
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.660]   of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:04.200]   However, as Brett mentioned, we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.080]   costs as a percentage of sales.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:14.640]   Operating expenses for the quarter increased $5.5 million to $92.8 million or 28.2% of
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:22.680]   sales as compared with $87.3 million or 28.1% of sales for the prior year period.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.880]   The year over year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net new stores.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:36.280]   Our operating income for the third quarter was $31.6 million which increased by 2.8%
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:42.520]   as compared to operating income of $30.7 million for the same quarter last year and decreased
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.960]   as a percentage of sales from 9.9% to 9.6%.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:54.160]   Net interest expense for the third quarter increased $0.2 million to $7 million as compared
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.880]   to $6.8 million in the same period last year.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.140]   The weighted average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:08.200]   approximately $112 million as compared to the prior year period.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.560]   The increase is primarily related to an increase in financing leased debt recorded in connection
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.840]   with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions and green field expansion as well as an increase in
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.400]   debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisition.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.120]   The weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately 140
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.200]   basis points year over year due to lower LIBOR and prime interest rates as well as lower
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.920]   borrowing rates associated with new leases.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.400]   Our effective tax rate was 24.1% for the third quarter compared to 15.3% for the same period
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   last year.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:51.920]   The year over year increase is primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit adjustment
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.200]   we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change which
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.880]   was related to certain deductions that the IRS accepted during the examination of our
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.280]   fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 tax return.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.440]   That income for the third quarter was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.280]   prior year period.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:21.360]   Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 56 cents compared to diluted
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   earnings per share of 61 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.760]   Adjusted diluted earnings per share which is a non-gap measure for the third quarter of
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:38.360]   fiscal 2020 was 60 cents which excludes from diluted earnings per share three cents of costs
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.480]   related to Monroe Forward Initiative and one cent of costs related to acquisition due diligence
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.080]   and integration.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.760]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 57 cents in the third quarter
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.680]   of fiscal 2019 which excluded one cent of costs related to Monroe Forward Initiative
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.560]   one cent of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs and six cents
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.280]   benefit from the one-time income tax adjustment.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.960]   For more information on this non-gap measure, please see the reconciliation of adjusted diluted
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.440]   earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.080]   Lastly, we opened one green field location during the third quarter.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.700]   As a reminder, green field stores include new construction as well as the acquisition
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.440]   of one-to-four store operations.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.360]   Green field locations on average are expected to add approximately $1 million each in annual
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   sales.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:39.760]   As of December 28, 2019, the company had 1,289 company operated stores and 99 franchise
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:47.320]   locations as compared with 1,186 company operated stores and 99 franchise locations
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.480]   as of December 29, 2018.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:57.100]   During the third quarter, we added 27 company operated stores and closed none.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:02.400]   Turning to slide nine, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.960]   as we execute our growth strategy.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.320]   Our capital expenditures were $42.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, of
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:17.440]   which approximately $18 million was related to investment in our Monroe Forward Initiative.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.840]   We are pleased with the progress of our Monroe Forward Strategy and we continue to expect
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.760]   an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.700]   to support investments in store reimage and technology.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:38.720]   Additionally, accretive acquisitions support our growth strategy.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.960]   During the first nine months of the year, we spent approximately $104 million on acquisitions
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.880]   including one-to-four store acquisitions completed as part of our green field expansion strategy.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.000]   As Brett mentioned, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.480]   represent an expected $120 million in annualized sales.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.720]   I'd like to provide some additional clarity here.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:09.000]   The $120 million in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.360]   fully integrated, which as we've stated in the past is usually in year three post-acquisition.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.520]   During years one and two following the acquisition, we typically see a step down in sales given
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.280]   the process of onboarding new stores to our model.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.380]   Moving on, we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:33.600]   our dividend program and paid approximately $22 million in dividends in the first nine
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.640]   months of fiscal 2020.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.520]   Finally, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.120]   to support our strategic growth initiatives.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.920]   We entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.120]   covenants.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.440]   We generated approximately $125 million of cash flow from operating activities during
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:00.280]   the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and debt under our revolving credit facility increased
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.040]   by approximately $59 million.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:10.440]   Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide 10, we have updated our fiscal 2020
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.280]   comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of 1% to flat to reflect the impact
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.360]   of our year to day performance.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.640]   Based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:31.400]   closed acquisition, we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1,275 million
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:40.920]   to $1,290 million, an increase of 6.2% to 7.5% as compared to fiscal 2019 sales.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:49.480]   This compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1,295 million to $1,315 million.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.180]   Our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.680]   2020.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.520]   Given the impact of our year to day performance, we expect fiscal 2020 earnings for diluted
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:11.200]   share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 representing a decline of 5.1% to 0.8% year
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.080]   over year compared to $2.37 in fiscal 2019.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:23.360]   This compares to the previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.55.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.080]   On an adjusted basis, which is a non-gap measure, the company expects diluted earnings
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:36.720]   for share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 representing a decline of 1.7% to growth
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.880]   of 2.5% which excludes from diluted earnings for share Monroe forward initiative cost and
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.180]   acquisition due diligence and integration cost.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:53.200]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings for share of $2.39 in fiscal 2019 which excluded
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.320]   Monroe forward initiative cost non-recurring corporate and field management realignment
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.680]   cost, acquisition due diligence and integration cost and the benefit from the one-time income
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.160]   tax adjustment.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.280]   Acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be diluted to earnings
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.880]   for diluted share during the year.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.680]   At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect an operating margin of approximately
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:24.720]   10.2% interest expense to be approximately $29 million, depreciation and amortization
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:31.480]   to be approximately $65 million and EBITDA to be approximately $196 million.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.020]   We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million this year.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:42.080]   This guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and is based on $34
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.040]   million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.480]   As always, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or Greenfield store opening.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.760]   I'll now turn the call over to Brott provide some closing remarks before we move to Q&A.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.840]   Thanks Brian.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.200]   We are making solid strides in the execution of our Monroe forward strategy, in particular
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.320]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.280]   The strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.840]   our confidence in this initiative.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.680]   The store rebrand and reimage program is further supported by our technological investments,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.920]   which we believe will help drive long term margin expansion.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.680]   In summary, we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.520]   the areas within our control.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.400]   We are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   ahead.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.280]   With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   Thank you.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.240]   I will be conducting a question and answer session.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.560]   If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.520]   A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.400]   You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.320]   For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.520]   before pressing the star keys.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.280]   Once again, that is star one to register questions at this time.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.320]   Our first question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.520]   Please go ahead.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.840]   Good morning.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.120]   Morning, Brian.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:22.440]   I want to focus on the weather here, but I want to dive deeper into sales trends in
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440]   the quarter.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:33.080]   Brian, you made some comments suggesting that to the degree to which weather impacted
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   the business.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.200]   I will go down a little further and say what that negative .9 comp would have been had
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.080]   the weather cooperated and some of the other metrics you are saying that really suggest
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.240]   the underlying business is trending better than what we saw in the weather affected fiscal
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.240]   queue three.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.040]   I will take the first part and then I will let Brian take the second part of the question
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.040]   Brian.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:02.880]   When we looked at the performance in the quarter, as we talked about our northern markets certainly
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.260]   underperform the southern markets and give you a little more granularity on that, certainly
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:15.080]   our stores up in the northeast and the Midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.040]   to weather conditions like you have in the northeast certainly underperform.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.000]   I think it is difficult to say what we would have done.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Certainly, I think we were expecting positive comps in the quarter.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.640]   Our internal expectations would have been closer to +1 to +1 and a half assuming normalized
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.160]   weather conditions that we have seen in the past.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.440]   We felt really good coming out of October and November given the strength of last year's
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:51.880]   performance we were hoping against and didn't get the cooperation from the weather in December
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.080]   that we were certainly expecting.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:59.600]   As I made the comments in my preparatory remarks, we certainly don't like talking about the
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:05.920]   weather, Brian, but we can't ignore the fact that when 50% of our businesses tires and we
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.080]   have a high concentration of stores in the northeast and Midwest, we are going to have
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.200]   outsized exposure to our comp performance.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:21.540]   Brian, would you mind restating the second part of your question?
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.680]   I think you covered – maybe I'll just follow up question if I could.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.920]   The adjusted guidance, you mentioned so in January you did a negative 4.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.120]   If I'm doing the math, it looks as though the adjusted guidance would suggest some
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.320]   type of pickup then in business in February and March.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.160]   I guess the first question is that assumption correct.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.800]   The following question is – I know we've seen this before with your business, but at
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.880]   what point does – because we still have a long – we have potentially a long term
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.840]   in the winter, the weather could still come, but is there a point at which in the quarter
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.280]   where the weather just comes too late?
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:09.960]   Yeah, so Brian, your assumption is correct regarding the implied comps.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:17.040]   So if you think about Q4 at the midpoint of let's say down 0.5 – for the full year
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:24.080]   down 0.5, that implies Q4 of down 2, which would be about February and March being down
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.040]   1 in order to get to that down 2.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.320]   So that's the dynamic at the midpoint, so there is an expectation of a pickup in February
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   and March.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.600]   Brian, maybe just a comment on the second part.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.280]   As we get deeper into the fourth quarter, our fourth quarter, the second half of the
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:46.880]   quarter in particular, I think we become less sensitive to the weather as you transition
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:53.720]   out of the pure winter conditions into spring.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.600]   Certainly I think the later in the quarter you get snowfall certainly doesn't have the
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:04.040]   same impact on tire demand like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.600]   October or November.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.520]   Consumers are pretty frifty with their money and I believe you get snowfall late in the
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.520]   season.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.640]   You get the tendency to forego that purchase and push it out until next season in particular.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:22.880]   The other thing to call out as well is if you look at our historic performance at the
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:30.000]   company, December and January have always been the most volatile month that we had to
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   continue with.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.960]   I think what we've seen in past performance here, trends coming out of December/January
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring month.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   Given the mild December/January heading into the balance of the quarter, we feel pretty
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.240]   good about the guidance range we provided.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.360]   As Brian said, our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our comp sales guidance that
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.200]   assumes run rate coming out of January, which we certainly believe we're going to be better
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.360]   than that as we roll into FY 21.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.560]   I appreciate all the color.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.960]   Thank you.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.200]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   Thank you.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.160]   Our next question is coming from Jonathan Lamers of BMO Capital Markets.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.520]   Please go ahead.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.520]   Thanks.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:26.040]   Brett, looking at your slide on the store rebranding, the 18% performance of the rebranded
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.720]   stores, I think it's good.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   I'm curious from your analytic model, how many years should it take a rebranded store
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.440]   to reach projected run rate sales?
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:48.160]   If you look at the top quadrant of that slide, Jonathan, we've shared, you know, with investors
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.200]   the fact that our service stores do roughly $600,000 in revenue and our tire stores do
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.200]   a million too.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.240]   In the case where we're rebranding a service store, you're working off the base on average
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:06.640]   of $600,000 and if we've seen a double-digit comp improvement off of that base, you can
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:13.520]   get to implied numbers certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp to the full
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.000]   maturity equally in the average sales performance of our tire rebranded stores.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.560]   That's one of the things that's encouraging about the strategy for us is not that it's
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:30.840]   just a one-time step up in sales, this creates the opportunity to create multiple years of
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:39.120]   sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning, our brand-related tires starts to mature.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.120]   Keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.320]   So if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires, we won't be relevant
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:54.120]   necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.920]   To put that on a timeline, if you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:04.200]   out to average sales performance of a tire brand and store.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:09.560]   Just to circle up on that, for the stores where you're rebranding, there's nothing
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.220]   about their market.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:19.000]   You would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.440]   stores of the $1.2 million, is that correct?
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.520]   Yeah, as a general statement, that's correct.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.920]   I think certainly you're going to have markets that will exceed the average and you'll have
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:35.120]   some markets that will be lower than that and that's part of the choices that we may
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.640]   use in the analytic model.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.480]   But on average, as we look across our, I'll say the opportunity stores, that being the
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.280]   $5.55, I think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.800]   of the $1.2 over time as they mature.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.400]   Thanks.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:35:03.360]   Switching gears, Brian, how much of a headwind to that revenue from acquisition were the conversions
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.680]   of the 42 California stores this quarter?
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:13.040]   Yeah, I mean, we had some disruption there.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:19.960]   I would say we haven't really quantified that from a sales standpoint, but that's a great
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:25.040]   point, Jonathan, in that we have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:32.440]   Monroe Playbook and then shortly thereafter, in this case about six months, get the reimage
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.920]   in-store brand standards in place.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:43.200]   So those in Q3, the 42 California stores went through that and are substantially through
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:49.960]   that as of the end of Q3, so we haven't quantified it, but it certainly had some impact on their
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.440]   sales performance in the quarter.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.440]   Okay.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:00.240]   And that $1.8 million charge from Monroe Forward Initiative this quarter, what was that
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   for?
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:09.560]   Yeah, it was all related to the store rebrand and reimage and it falls into three primary
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.840]   buckets related to that.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.920]   The first is non-capital items that we send to the stores.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:24.120]   So as we think about updated safety chains, updated Bay banners, updated point of sale
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:31.160]   marketing materials, all of these things to get the store initially to the standard that
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:37.400]   are not capital in terms of the actual work and construction done on the store.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.840]   That's the first bucket.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   The second bucket is non-capital work that's actually done.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:51.920]   We get into these stores and we identify non-capital repairs, demolition, as well as some of the
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:58.600]   fixed versus replace items, for example, stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   a new floor.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.520]   Those are things that make sense economically, but you get different treatment from expense
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.040]   versus capital for.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.760]   So that's the second bucket.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.040]   And the third is just right off of existing leaseholds in the stores.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:18.320]   Anything from counters to maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.000]   when we initially branded the stores over to a Monroe brand.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.080]   Those are the three primary buckets that Monroe Forward Initiative costs consist of.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.760]   Okay, thanks for your comment.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.760]   Thank you.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.400]   Excuse me, our next question is coming from Brett Jordan of Jeffries.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   Please go ahead.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.360]   Hey, good morning, guys.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.800]   Good morning, Brett.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   Back to slide five.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.400]   I guess if we look at the 18% growth in rebranded stores, if we really sort of look at the comparable
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.920]   growth there, X the new product lines you're adding, how's the service comp against the
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.520]   service comp in those stores?
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   Are you seeing, you know, a pickup as you change the brand?
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:05.600]   Yeah, maybe just to clarify though, Brett, I think we're actually not adding any new products
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   to the service menu.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.440]   Right, but you're adding tires to the store, right?
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.200]   Yeah, it's just mixed, right?
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:17.360]   So even our service stores today sell tires, it's only 15% they're mixed.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:24.080]   So we're certainly seeing growth, more outsized growth in other tire sales and we've had success
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.880]   in maintaining the rate of growth that we've seen on the service side, which has been part
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:37.160]   of our thesis is hold on to the service business that we've enjoyed that's high margin and
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.880]   then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the tire
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.880]   category.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.520]   We're seeing growth on both sides.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:52.560]   Okay, and I guess we look at the reimage, how does that compare to comparable service
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.080]   stores in the network that hadn't been re-imaged?
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.880]   I guess sort of looking at it again, sort of apples to apples, you know, against the
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.880]   old stores.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.440]   Yeah, I think if you can figure out which stores we're talking about there, the 30 stores
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:11.200]   are Rochester and I think the Rochester stores certainly have been performing quite well
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.880]   relative to what our expectations were on re-image.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.480]   We certainly didn't expect to see double digit growth rates out of our re-image store when
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:25.280]   we set out to do this initiative, but we were seeing more positive growth out of the stores
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:30.720]   up until the last quarter, given the exposure that we've had to the weather in the north.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.360]   But compared to other stores, we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a customer
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:41.000]   service point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers facing
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.240]   similar, I would say, market backdrop from a weather point of view.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:50.280]   Okay, could you give us, I guess, sort of the spread between the Southern Store Cop
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.120]   and the Northern Store Cop, you know, how big of a delta was it?
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.360]   I mean, it was a couple hundred basis points of performance.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:05.640]   Okay, and I guess for housekeeping, could you give us the monthly?
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:15.600]   Yeah, so we were -- one second here, Brett -- we were down 1.2 in October, down 1.7
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   in November and up 0.4 in December.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:24.160]   Okay, and then one -- just this is -- sorry, I had the questions -- on the supply chain
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.920]   side, I mean, just to throw the virus into it since that's popular these days, you guys
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.400]   do a lot of direct sourcing, you know, the white box product out of China.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:37.000]   Do you see any impact on supply chain from what's going on?
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.160]   We haven't seen any to this point, Brett.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:46.360]   We're obviously working through contingency plans, which we have had to develop actually
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:53.040]   related to the tariff issues, so we feel pretty confident that through the network of your
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.760]   multiple supply points that we'll be able to overcome any particular issues coming from
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.760]   the virus.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.280]   I'm sorry, Brett, go ahead.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.560]   I said no, it's joking.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   I said I had to get my first virus question then there.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.440]   All right, thanks a lot, guys.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.560]   Okay, thanks, Brett.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   Thank you.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.200]   Our next question is coming from Rick Nelson of Stevens.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   Please go ahead.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   Thanks.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   Good morning.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:33.560]   Follow up on the weather last year, I think December or January, you also pointed to mild
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.560]   winter weather.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:41.760]   Do you think this year was incrementally worse than the prior year?
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:48.040]   I think if you look at, you know, analyst reports that we've seen talking about I guess
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:54.720]   the impact that the mild winter has had on not only our category, but any other retail.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:42:00.720]   The data would indicate that this has been more mild, certainly versus last year.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:06.040]   I think we look at precipitation, which is very important for us as a form of snow with
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.760]   our tire business.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:14.480]   Certainly it's been a much more mild winter this year relative to last year.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:22.160]   Thanks, and Brett, any updates on your partnership with Amazon?
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:30.720]   What you're seeing there on the install side and how you think your tire prices compared
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:40.040]   to theirs and the tire category overall, I'm curious about what happened with units in
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.120]   the period and market share?
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.960]   Yep, so let's start with units.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:56.400]   Our units were down to, every selling price was up one for the quarter.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.560]   How that compares, we don't have a lot of syndicated data, of course, that we can look
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.260]   to and be definitive on that.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:08.480]   We lean on, I guess, our channel checks and information from our tire manufacturers that
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:14.000]   have good visibility across multiple brands and feels like similar to other companies
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.320]   that have exposure to the north, particularly northeast, to the degree that we do feel like
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:27.400]   we are probably in line with what we picked up through suppliers and others.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.200]   As relates to Amazon, I think we're still pleased with our relationship with them as
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:37.000]   well as other online tire retailers.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.400]   We will eventually expand the relationship in FY 21 to include all stores.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:50.080]   We talked about last quarter, our priority has been what I mentioned on today's call,
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.560]   completing the entire category management pricing tool, as well as the labor scheduling
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:00.600]   tool that are just for our organization on a higher priority at this stage than expanding,
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.360]   but we are committed to expanding that relationship going forward.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:08.800]   Related to tire pricing, as you know, Rick, the entire category is very complicated.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:15.440]   You have over 30,000 SKUs that you need to manage effectively across multiple markets.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.000]   One of the reasons why we've invested in the tire category management tool is to do a
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   couple of things.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.760]   One is give us much better visibility into demand dynamics defined by elasticity down
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.600]   to a SKU level.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.680]   By having that visibility, it's going to create a much more granular approach that
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.440]   we're going to use for pricing.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   It will allow us the price at the SKU level in our industry with the intent being strike
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.560]   that right balance between driving the right price to drive unit volume while preserving
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.840]   and expanding our entire margins through right mix at right price.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.840]   I'm encouraged we're in pilot form of that now.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:04.640]   We will be operational by Q1 of next year, fully operational.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.720]   The rollout of that's pretty small in scale because we control our pricing centrally,
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.520]   so a small team of people will be trained up on using that system.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:18.160]   Between now and Q1 will be testing in parallel and makes us more confident with the results
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.840]   that we're seeing from the system.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.080]   That makes sense.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.800]   Thanks for the color and good luck.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.800]   Thanks Rick.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   Thank you.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.680]   Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.040]   star one on your telephone keypad.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.880]   Our next question is coming from Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.880]   Please go ahead.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.880]   Hi.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.880]   Good morning.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.880]   Thank you for the question.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.880]   Morning.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.880]   I wanted to go back.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.640]   I know in the prior quarters when you started rolling out some of these store refreshes you
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.960]   called out a hit or head one two comp during that quarter, really just from distraction.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.600]   You know, it makes sense as you're in there kind of reworking and revamping the stores.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.800]   I believe you said it was about a 70 basis to find hit last quarter.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.360]   Did you quantify that this quarter or is there a way for you to kind of break that out or
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.080]   just whether overshadow that?
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:18.040]   Yeah, I think we said last quarter Stephanie that we, we walked everyone kind of through
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:25.320]   the seven step process and talked about how we were retooling it to take a lot of that
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.040]   work or almost all that work off of the store team.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.840]   So we were able to effectively do that in Q3.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.040]   We didn't expect that we were going to have to talk about a headwind and we really don't
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.680]   have to in terms of from disruption related to the store reimage.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:46.760]   I think the California stores on the West Coast maybe saw a little bit more in disruption
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:52.760]   just because we did put a little bit more on them based on their lack of proximity to
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:59.040]   our core resources that are doing the reimage, but for the 74 comp stores, those were largely
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.680]   I would say undisrupted.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:06.540]   Great and then just as a follow up when we look at the entire category in general, what
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.600]   are you saying from this over in an inflationary environment?
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:15.080]   I know it was inflationary earlier this year kind of reviewing how you saw during the
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:20.520]   quarter and your expectations going forward as well.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.840]   Yes Stephanie, when you look at go back to Q2, one of the things we commented on was
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:32.560]   just we saw some inflationary pricing on the top end of the product category with more
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:39.160]   premium brands and the first part of the second quarter we didn't see a lot of movement
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.400]   on the low end brands if you will, opening price point brands.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:48.800]   You saw that change exiting Q2 and into Q3 and I think as you saw and we made the comments
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:56.560]   in our prepared remarks we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across all
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:03.320]   price points relative to that point in Q3 I think our expectation for Q4 is pretty stable
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.080]   environment around pricing.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:14.640]   We don't expect meaningful material changes in the next quarter, we're very focused now
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   on now optimizing our internal pricing relative to the market leveraging the category management
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   pricing until we talk about it.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.400]   Great and then just lastly for me, a more high level as we think through the strategy
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:37.520]   to expand your tire services at some of the mixed changes at your service stores, does
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:43.280]   that just by nature put you a little bit more susceptible to changes in weather on an annual
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:49.200]   basis to your point you said on the call that it is the tire category that if it's a more
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:55.360]   mild weather where you don't really see the volume during that period so does this mean
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:00.400]   that in these conversations going forward weather could have a larger impact or similar
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:04.000]   to what we saw this year that may be in prior years so maybe your thoughts on that at this
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.280]   high level would be great.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.280]   Thanks so much.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   Thanks Stephanie.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:14.880]   I think strategically I would start with this they are strategy and rose we like the
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:20.760]   business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that's focused on tires and full
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   service.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:26.880]   I think you're not going to see us migrate to a tire only category as a broad sweeping
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.560]   strategy for all the reasons you just mentioned.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.200]   We like diversification in the services.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:37.240]   We like being very relevant on frequently purchased items like scheduled maintenance
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.000]   for cars and certainly brakes and other undercar services.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.560]   I think as we increase our total business certainly we're going to pick up a little
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:54.480]   more exposure to tires as we convert more stores in the north I think to that however
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:00.520]   I think our broader company strategy is diversifier store footprint more into the south and out
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:05.400]   west and certainly in those regions of the country you don't see I think a level of
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:11.520]   volatility that comes with the tire business like you would find in the northeast and midwestern
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:20.820]   markets.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.960]   Great that's everything for me appreciate it.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   Thanks Stephanie.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   Thank you.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:31.640]   Our next question is coming from Scott Stember of CL King please go ahead.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.720]   Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.720]   Morning Scott.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:41.940]   Following up on that last question about high level about weather and I know the goal
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.320]   here was with all this heavy lifting that you're doing right now on all these new processes
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:52.320]   to get to the point where I guess we're not talking about weather having worked.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.720]   Weather does not really deliver all the quarter from a common perspective.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:00.000]   Could you talk about I mean just broadly speaking about how long do you think that will take
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.360]   for us to get to that point where weather could be a headwind but it's not going to
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:10.880]   be a determinant whether you're positive or negative from a common standpoint.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:17.380]   I think given our exposure to the northeast and as long as our store concentration is
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:22.840]   heavy in the Midwest and northeast and herring in that as we pick up exposure I think to
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:28.360]   weather obviously we don't like to talk about sky as you said our strategy is diversify
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:33.840]   the footprint keep continuing to grow down south and that's reflected by our acquisitions
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.220]   we continue to build out Florida and have expanded now into Louisiana and Tennessee and
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:46.520]   certainly out west is reflected of that desire to create more or less volatility in our business
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.640]   due to the store footprint.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:56.200]   Now in our core store markets we don't accept internally the volatility in our business
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:03.860]   and we're invested in technology as we talked about to help us better execute in stores
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:09.920]   through better trained people executing better on the phones with our phone upgrade that
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.640]   we're currently doing all the initiatives under Monroe forward are designed to drive
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:19.840]   performance in our stores regardless of weather I think will help neutralize some of the impact
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:28.840]   that we see from from the volatility that comes with snow and colder temperatures and
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:34.120]   just the last question you know I know that there are certain things like tires that
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:40.920]   we'll see an immediate impact from from weather but more on the side of mechanical parts typically
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:48.640]   you could see an impact from you know warmer weather or colder weather you know a few quarters
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.680]   down the road is there a chance that we could see an extended negative impact on the mechanical
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.360]   part side in the next couple of quarters and that's all I have thanks.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.520]   Thanks Scott I think as we commented in the quarter our brakes were down three percent
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:08.000]   in the quarter certainly we're up against strong comp from last year but also I would
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.160]   say we do sell a fair share of brake services through tires because if you take the consumers
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:19.680]   tires off their vehicle gives you the chance to inspect their wheels their brakes and we
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:25.520]   do see some nice demand for conversion from tires into brakes as a result of that.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:32.840]   As it relates to the downstream effect I think certainly more harsh winners of a tendency
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:39.400]   to tear up things on the vehicles however I will say one benefit of having a more mild
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:45.720]   winner is usually that leads to spring coming sooner it opens up a window I think for an
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:53.200]   extended spring selling season so we felt feel like we're well positioned I think coming
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.040]   out of the winter given our strength and how we perform historically in the service categories
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:03.280]   and given the the emphasis that we placed on good better best packages in store I think
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:10.560]   we feel confident that we'll we'll be well positioned going into the spring selling season
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:16.280]   got it that's all I have thanks thanks Scott thank you at this time I would like to turn
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:22.480]   the floor back over to management for closing comments thank you for joining us today and

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Good morning and welcome to the first quarter of 2020 General Electric Company Earnings
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200]   Conference call.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.220]   My name is Brandon and I'll be your operator for today.
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.400]   At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.120]   Later we will conduct the question and answer session during which you can dial star one
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.800]   if you have a question.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.320]   Please note this conference is being recorded and I will now turn it over to Steve Winiker,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.840]   Vice President of Investor Communications, you may begin sir.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.840]   Thanks Brandon.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.680]   Good morning and welcome to GE's first quarter 2020 Earnings call.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.520]   I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO Larry Kulp and CFO Carolina Dadekapa.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.880]   Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.380]   on our website.
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.080]   Note that some of the statements we're making are forward looking and are based on our best
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080]   view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.800]   As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change if the
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800]   world changes.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.080]   With that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.160]   Steve, thanks.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.200]   Good morning everyone.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.080]   We hope you and your families are healthy and safe.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.660]   Our thoughts are with all of those affected by this global pandemic.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.520]   We recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.640]   On behalf of GE, I want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.240]   community, many of whom were privileged to call our customers, working tirelessly to
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.380]   protect all of us.
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.380]   Thank you.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.000]   When we last spoke during our Outlook call in March, we were encouraged by the continued
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.720]   strength and aviation and healthcare and the progress made in power and renewables.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.720]   In the eight-week sense, the world has fundamentally changed.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.440]   As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly, hitting hard and hitting fast.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.600]   While this is an earnings call, our goal today is to provide you with the most current and
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.240]   relevant information we have and, as always, to be as open and transparent as we possibly
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.240]   can.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.840]   So forgive us if we run a little long today.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   The COVID-19 dynamics at GE, like the economy at large, are fluid and still evolving, but
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.760]   clearly challenging in the near term.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.200]   With that, I'll start with our response to COVID-19.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.700]   Carolina, who is joining our earnings call for the first time will cover the financials,
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.440]   then I'll wrap with a more in-depth view of our current operations.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.840]   Moving to slide two, during this unprecedented time, we're focused on three areas.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.360]   First, the health and safety of our employees and our communities.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.760]   We established a COVID-19 task force that is working to ensure we're doing everything
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.400]   in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with the various government
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.360]   directives and medical advisories in real time.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.240]   To that end, we've encouraged those employees who are not directly performing, customer
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.760]   facing essential jobs to work from home wherever possible.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.440]   But given the mission critical work we do at GE, not everyone can stay home.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.680]   I'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.800]   unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers, supporting essential
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.520]   services like hospitals, power generation, airlines and national defense.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.600]   We're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.040]   This includes temperature screenings, face coverings and gloves as necessary and physical
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.920]   distancing, all keeping with national, state and local guidelines.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.720]   I'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   We recently established an employee relief fund and more than 75 senior leaders across
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.920]   GE have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.280]   Our second priority is continuing to serve our customers.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.040]   In healthcare we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.680]   and treat COVID-19 patients, including respiratory CT monitoring solutions X-ray anesthesia and
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.120]   point of care ultrasound product lines.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.980]   Already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.320]   end of June.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.160]   Healthcare digital and AI solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.960]   at once and automate wrote tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.840]   on life saving work.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.920]   Across all of our businesses we're in constant communication with employees, customers, suppliers
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.560]   and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.600]   Our third priority is preserving our strength.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.520]   First and foremost sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.440]   a key focus.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.160]   With the recent closing of the biopharma transaction we received $20 billion of net proceeds.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.000]   This provides GE with optionality to protect our company and remain flexible and importantly
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.920]   we retain the $17 billion leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem striving
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.160]   for precision health.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.440]   Preserving our strength at a time like this also requires a different operating model.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.120]   Here I draw on my experiences as CEO managing through 9/11 and the global financial crisis.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.840]   There are three steps in this model.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.960]   Embrace reality, redefine winning and execute the plan.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.240]   Easy to say, hard to do.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.100]   Starting with embrace reality, this is necessary in a time like this when so much is changed
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.720]   and remains uncertain.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.360]   For us it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation and we
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.600]   may be for a while.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.180]   We wish it were otherwise, but that's not our reality.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.060]   Next redefine winning.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.800]   We came into 2020 with a plan to define winning as profitable growth, margin expansion and
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.680]   cash generation.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.320]   Now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.240]   Let me share some ways we're doing this.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.320]   While safety has always been a top priority for GE COVID-19 has reshaped our safety agenda.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.800]   In terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and decriminal margins
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.960]   in the second half are key focus areas and in health care we clearly didn't come into
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.020]   the year expecting to increase our ventilator production fourfold, but we will.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.100]   And finally execute the plan.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.880]   We're moving with speed, discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure, priority more
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.720]   than $2 billion of cost actions and more than $3 billion of cash actions and this is where
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.520]   lean is particularly relevant from daily management to traditional Kanban systems which helped
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.380]   reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools we're rolling out across GE.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.600]   Let me share a recent example from gas power.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.040]   In our Greenville facility the team used lean to cut the distance that a single part travels
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:16.240]   during production from three miles, yes three miles to a mere 165 feet, flashing the time
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.800]   it took to make that part by 42%.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.720]   These are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.520]   environment.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.480]   So that's our approach here we're facing the pandemic head on while continuing to execute
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.400]   our long term strategy for GE.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.720]   Moving to slide three you'll find a snapshot of our first quarter results and Carolina
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.600]   will take you through this in detail but first a few top line thoughts.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.560]   As I noted we entered the year with momentum however as COVID 19 continued to spread globally
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.960]   and I'm not going to sugarcoat this we got hit hard and some of our highest margin parts
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.440]   of our best performing businesses.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.640]   This is especially true at aviation services where COVID 19 cost a rapid decline in commercial
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.240]   aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the second half of March.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.200]   A similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions caused
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.840]   by COVID 19 impacted our field personnel and across all of our businesses we started to
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.480]   see some project fulfillment and execution issues.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   At the same time healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.640]   in the fight against COVID 19.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.440]   Taking a step back about 80% of our roughly $400 billion backlog is in services which
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.000]   have a long time horizon and while services have been hurt in the near term those capabilities
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.120]   remain one of our greatest strengths.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.280]   They keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships especially through
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   periods of volatility.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.160]   So in the spirit of embracing reality let me frame for you what we're seeing right now
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.960]   at a high level and then I'll do a deeper dive after Carolina reviews the first quarter.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.520]   In aviation in a GCask airlines are conserving cash not flying the planes they have limiting
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.480]   maintenance spend where they can and all the while deferring orders in many places.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.840]   No one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume but the reality
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.560]   is likely it's not soon.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.960]   So we're redefining winning from margin expansion in 2020 to improving our decriminal
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.600]   margins this year which requires we aggressively adjust our cost structure.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.960]   That's what winning looks like for aviation and they're moving forward with a comprehensive
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   plan.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:44.200]   To be clear we'll get back to targeting those 20% operating margins post pandemic.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.040]   In healthcare we've been on the front lines combating COVID 19 since the early days in
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.840]   Wuhan.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.280]   This is fundamental to our mission while we've seen demand surge for certain products other
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.320]   products including those in our high margin pharmaceutical diagnostics business have
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.880]   been negatively impacted as multiple procedures are deferred.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.280]   Healthcare is likely to rebound faster than aviation but we're still fast tracking additional
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:18.400]   cost out actions targeting an incremental 700 million dollars since Karen and the team
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.560]   spoke with you in December.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:27.080]   Empower in renewable energy the impact of COVID 19 has been more limited to date specifically
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.080]   at power we're experiencing outage delays and restrictions in field service travel and
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.520]   we're monitoring new unit orders and services.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.240]   To offset this we're further right sizing the cost structure and empower we already
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.200]   reduced head count by 700 in the first quarter.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.640]   Now clearly across GE there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:57.260]   including the full duration magnitude and pace of recovery across our end markets operations
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.780]   and supply chains we're also monitoring how the resulting interest rate environment will
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:07.720]   impact pension obligations and our runoff insurance business.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.960]   So let me tell you what we do know the second quarter will be the first full quarter with
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.520]   pressure from COVID 19 and we expect that our financial results will decline sequentially
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.740]   before they improve later this year.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:27.160]   The bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead but this too shall pass I'm confident
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:32.800]   the underlying reset we took over the last 18 months to focus GE's portfolio and instill
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:40.360]   a greater focus on customers and lead give us a running start for what we face today.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:45.840]   Moreover I see in our response to COVID 19 signs of how we're moving faster to change
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.580]   GE for the good, more to rework to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.720]   in aviation, travel restrictions spurring on the use of remote digital technology to
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.360]   complete field work and renewables and more capital discipline across the board.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:08.540]   With new leaders assimilating faster and with real impact healthcare comes to mind.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.920]   So all of this in combination with the planned actions we'll discuss later are accelerating
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.720]   our transformation of GE.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.280]   With that I'll turn it over to Carolina but before I do let me say how pleased I am to
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   have her on board.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.120]   In two short months it's clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:33.320]   operational bias for action and executing with speed.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   Thank you Larry.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   I'm proud to join my first call at CFO of GE and help lead this company forward.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:48.160]   As you noted we're operating in unprecedented times and we focus on first keeping our financial
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.480]   position strong and safe with a keen eye on leverage and liquidity as well as cash flow
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.640]   and capital discipline.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.840]   While GE's actions over the last couple of years have put us on stronger footing ahead
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.400]   of this situation we will do more.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.760]   Second working with our businesses to take the right action not only to help mitigate
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.200]   the impact of COVID-19 but to serve customers better, operate smarter and more efficiently
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.600]   and integrate lean more holistically.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   While Larry and I are focused on the near term we're also managing for the long term.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.560]   We're working together to reduce complexity at GE and build a lean culture that delivers
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.800]   sustainable earnings and cash flow generation.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.480]   Today my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.040]   will help you see what I see across the businesses.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.400]   With that let's turn to slide 4.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.560]   This was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated taking
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.320]   it from the top.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.640]   First quarter orders were down 3 percent organically or down 4 ex biopharma.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.200]   Growth in power and healthcare was offset by double digit decline in aviation and renewables.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.800]   Both equipment and service orders were down low single digits.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.720]   I'll cover this by business shortly.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.840]   Industrial revenue was down 5 percent organically or down 6 ex biopharma.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.720]   With equipment revenue flat and services down 9 percent.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.280]   Both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID-19.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.280]   Adjusted industrial profit margins were down 450 basis points organically.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.400]   Most of the dilution came from aviation and renewables with the aviation impact mostly
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.920]   driven by COVID-19.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:40.160]   Now let's discuss the EPS WAP starting at continuing EPS of 72 cents.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.640]   There was a 75 cents gain primarily related to the 11.5 billion after tax gain from the
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.800]   biopharma sale which also included 1 cent of tax benefit in geo capital.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:57.880]   This was partially offset by a 4.6 billion after tax loss on our remaining Baker huge
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.280]   stake which we measure at fair value edge quarter.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.840]   On restructuring and other items we incurred 2 cents of charges.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   This is principally related to the reduction of aviation's U.S. workforce.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.960]   Lastly non-operating pension and other benefit plans were 6 cents head within the quarter.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.720]   Excluding these items adjusted EPS was 5 cents.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.080]   As described earlier our earnings performance was materially impacted by COVID-19 and other
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.080]   market dynamics.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.520]   This was primarily in aviation and geo capital with negative marks and impairments in both
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.680]   gcas and insurance as well as higher credit costs.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   We estimate the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from COVID-19 roughly
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.020]   700 million.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:50.360]   Drivers included lower aftermarket sales, project delays and supply chain constraints.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.160]   This impact is higher than anticipated at the March outlook call reflecting the rapid
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.600]   global progression of the pandemic.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.560]   While our prior forecast largely affected the slowdown in China.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.960]   Our focus on addressing this pandemic is global.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.240]   We're targeting more than 2 billion of cost out this year.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.840]   While this may not affect the full impact we're rapidly addressing both cost and cash
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.000]   and making our businesses more agile and customer focused over time.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.400]   I can tell you from my experience that as these programs build momentum and the company
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.580]   leaders begin to see how powerful results can be they tend to extend beyond their stated
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.580]   goals.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.260]   With just what I have seen so far I'm encouraged that we can have some of that same experience
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.040]   achieved.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   Moving to cash.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:42.400]   As many of you know the first quarter is typically low for our free cash flow.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.480]   This year we're impacted by our usual seasonality but also COVID-19 especially in aviation.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   Industrial free cash flow was a use of 2.2 billion.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.040]   1 billion worse than prior year but notably excluding aviation each industrial business
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:04.800]   improved free cash flow versus last year turning to the key drivers in the quarter.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   Starting with net earnings.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:11.960]   If you exclude the biopharm again and the market on our big huge investment income depreciation
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:18.940]   and amortization total 700 million that's down 900 million versus prior year.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:25.800]   Working capital negative 2.6 billion the significant use of cash down 1.1 billion.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.280]   Let me take it through the main factors.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.600]   First we had the net inflow in accounts receivable driven by seasonally lower volume in gas power
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.120]   and renewables.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.480]   Second we had an outflow in accounts cable driven by lower volume in aviation and higher
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.120]   disbursements related to prior year material bias in renewables.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:51.300]   Third we increased inventory to support unexpected second and third quarter volume ramp in onshore
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.000]   wind and shop output declined in aviation.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.320]   Fourth progress collections they were a use of cash as new orders and milestone payments
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.600]   were more than effected by burn down of prior progress payments in power and renewables.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.000]   Lastly we also spent about 600 million in gross capital.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.680]   We don't track now to reduce 25 percent of our cap expense this year.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.520]   For cash flow in total we estimate the first quarter impact from COVID-19 of around 1 billion
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.040]   the majority of which was felt in aviation.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.200]   As we look forward we expect continued free cash flow pressure.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.880]   We're targeting more than 3 billion in cash action.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.160]   However over time we know that each business can be a better cash generator as we improve
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.440]   execution.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.480]   Moving to slide six we continue to strengthen our balance sheet.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.320]   Largest milestone in the quarter was closing by a pharma.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:55.280]   With 20 billion of proceed we ended the quarter with 33.8 billion of industry cash up approximately
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.600]   16 billion sequentially.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:04.400]   CA capital ended with 13.5 billion of cash down approximately 5.3 billion sequentially
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.680]   driven by contractual majorities.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.880]   We continue to hold a liquidity balance covering 12 months of g debt majorities.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:18.760]   We've recently taken actions to enhance and extend our liquidity and pay down debt.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:24.760]   On April 17 GE entered into a three year 15 billion syndicated revolving credit facility.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:31.720]   This was a planned refinancing of GE's prior 20 billion syndicated revolver credit facility
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.440]   including bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of 20 billion in total credit
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.360]   lines action flowing forward.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.080]   Following the sale of biopharma we also improved our liquidity profile in April.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.480]   We reduced our near term debt majorities by issuing 6 billion in GE debt in April and
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.080]   subsequently tendering for 4.2 billion of debt.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.800]   We plan to use the remaining 1.8 billion of proceeds to further debt reduction and the
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.440]   combination of transaction will therefore be leveraged neutral.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:10.480]   GE industrial has no debt majorities in 2021, 1.9 billion of majorities in 2022 and 9 hundred
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.480]   million in 2023.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.280]   At GE industrial we reduced debt by approximately 7 billion.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:23.120]   We reduced commercial paper used by 1.1 billion in the quarter and we paid 6 billion of the
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.360]   intercompany loan from GE to GE capital in April using proceeds from biopharma.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:35.000]   At GE capital we reduced debt by 4 billion so we reduced external debt by 10 billion
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.560]   year today including 4.7 billion of majorities in the quarter and an additional 5.4 billion
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:48.400]   of 2020 majorities tended in April offset by GE's 6 billion repayments from the intercompany
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   loan.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:57.880]   Our financial policy goals remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than 2.5
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:05.360]   times net debt to EBDA at GE industrial and less than 4 times debt to equity at GE capital.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.080]   Accredit rating in the single A range and reinstating dividend in line with peers over
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.080]   time.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.680]   We remain committed to achieving our leveraged targets but we now expect to achieve those
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:23.340]   targets over a longer period than previously and not due to the impact of COVID-19.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:28.520]   On slide 7 we'll discuss industrial segments results.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   Starting with aviation.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.160]   As you've noted our first quarter results were materially impacted.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.800]   Orders were down 13% organically with both equipment and service orders bound.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.000]   Equipment orders were down 27% primarily driven by commercial engines business due to the
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.520]   max grounding and the COVID impact.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:55.040]   Service orders were down 4% primarily driven by commercial services partially upset by military
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.520]   which one new fighter and helicopter service orders from the U.S.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   DOD.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.240]   Service orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders which were up 60%
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.240]   year over year.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:13.840]   Backlog of 273 billion was flat sequentially and up 22% versus prior years primarily driven
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.720]   by long term service agreements this included roughly 200 litre unit order translations
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.360]   in the quarter.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.520]   Revenue was down 11% organically.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.560]   Equipment revenue was down 17% we shipped 472 commercial install and spare engine units
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.040]   this quarter down 37 versus prior years.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:46.100]   Safe of 272 deep 1A and 1B units were down 152 and CFM 56 units were down 98 units.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:53.000]   Service revenue was down 8% due to commercial services down 11% this was driven by lower
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.440]   spare parts shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of COVID-19.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:05.060]   Capital military revenue was down 7% with 146 engine unit shipments down 9% and this
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:11.000]   was driven by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound material partly upset by the advanced
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.440]   programs growth.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:19.440]   Operating profit was down 39% organically primarily on lower volume and negative mixed pressure
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:26.240]   in commercial services from the impact of COVID-19 and lower spare engine units.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:32.640]   Result margin contracted 650 basis points organically and this was primarily due to COVID-19
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.060]   impacting our commercial businesses in both engines and services.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:44.320]   The continued 737 max grounding the non repeat of prior year favorable contract adjustments
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.960]   and the first full quarter of revenue from our arrow derivative business now that we
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:54.520]   have deconsolidated bigger fuse add a bit more color COVID-19 represents just over
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:00.820]   half of the year margin difference 737 max timing considering install and spare engine
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:08.160]   volume and supply chain except cost represent additional 20% of the volume.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.200]   Moving to health care which performed well orders were up 9% organically equipment orders
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.400]   were up 14% and services were up 1.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.120]   Health care orders excluding wire pharma were up 6% driven by a surge demand related
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.120]   to COVID-19.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:28.680]   This was partially affected by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:34.340]   to COVID-19 examples like MR and intervention in health care systems as well as contrast
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:42.160]   media and nuclear tracers in pharmaceutical diagnosis by scientist orders were up 10%
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:48.520]   backlog was 17.4 billion down 6% sequentially and down 3% versus prior year due to the sale
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:53.880]   of biopharma excluding biopharma back there was up 1% sequentially and 4% versus prior
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:01.960]   year revenue was up 2% organically and 1% excluding biopharma health care systems revenue
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:10.120]   was up 2% with services and 3% with equipment flat life sciences was up 4% operating profit
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:17.160]   was up 10% organically segment margin expanded 140 basis points organically or 30 basis points
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:22.900]   excluding biopharma this was driven by volume and cost productivity of fed by price and
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:30.040]   logistics pressures from COVID-19 next on power we had mixed results with equipment
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:37.120]   top line strength of fed by challenges in services orders were up 14% organically gas
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:44.040]   power orders were up 8% with equipment orders up 37% largely due to one turnkey order we
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:51.440]   booked 2.2 gigawatt of orders for 9 gas turbines gas power service orders were down 3% with
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:57.360]   contractual services down and transaction and upgrades roughly flat power portfolio orders
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:04.120]   were up 27% with strong equipment and services orders in steam and power conversion backlog
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:11.240]   closed at 85 billion flat sequentially and down 1% versus prior gas backlog was 71 billion
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:19.280]   flat sequentially revenue was down 12% organically largely driven by services in gas power revenue
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   was down 12% gas power equipment revenue was up 4% organically on higher H turbine mix
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.320]   we shipped nine gas turbines versus sorry we shipped seven gas turbines versus nine
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.400]   gas turbines in the first quarter of 19 we helped our customers achieve commercial operations
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:44.840]   on over 32 units translating almost 4.7 gigawatts of new power added to the grid gas power services
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:51.000]   revenue was down 19% organically as outages this and transactional sales pushed out of
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.960]   the quarter due to COVID-19 and we had lower revenue on higher margin upgrades despite this
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   services would still have been down in the quarter this was driven by supply based constraints
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:09.040]   on hot gas part parts and outage cost overall pressuring our CSI margin rates power portfolio
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:15.800]   revenue was down 12% this was driven by lower volumes across the sub segments in still we
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.640]   had lower services back low convertibility in nuclear the decline was driven by outage
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.760]   timing and in power conversion refined our sales parameter focused on higher margin market
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:34.380]   segment operating profit was down 239 million and segment margin contracted 570 basis points
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:41.240]   organically while gas power fixed costs were down 9% sequentially and 16 versus prior year
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:48.720]   this was more than upset by lower service volume and additional cost from COVID-19 disruption
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:54.040]   next on renewables continue revenue growth was more than upset by fulfillment and execution
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:01.580]   issues impacting profitability orders were down 11% organically equipment were down 11
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:08.440]   as we cycle a stronger US PTC and services were down 23% a positive spot in the quarter
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:16.920]   was international orders which were up 11% backlog of 26.5 billion on 4% sequentially
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:24.920]   but up 5% versus prior year revenue was up 28% organically this was mainly driven by
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:32.240]   onshore winds up 60% onshore equipment revenue was up 81% with the new unit turbine delivers
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:41.400]   of 731 more than double prior year and we power kit delivers of 219 up 40% onshore services
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:48.240]   revenue excluding the power kits was up 15% onshore order pricing index continues to
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:54.880]   stabilize at 1% in line with recent trends grid revenue was down 8% mostly due to side
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:01.800]   closures and delayed milestones driven by COVID-19 operating loss was down 115 million
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   this was driven by the supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 fulfillment delays and the
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.600]   non recurrence of the non cash gain from an offshore wind contract termination in the
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:19.640]   prior year this was partially upset by higher onshore wind volume segment margin contracted
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:25.600]   210 basis points mainly driven by the same items mentioned above and the range of execution
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:34.920]   issues were fixing at grid and hydro moving to slide 8 starting with GA capital in the
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:41.540]   quarter adjusted continue operations generated a net loss of 180 million this exclude the
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:47.360]   impact of the capital loss tax benefit utilized against biopharma gain result in 88 million
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   of earnings compared to prior year which exclude exclude the US tax reform benefit continuing
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:00.600]   net earnings was unfavorable by 154 million this was due to negative marks and impairments
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:06.700]   of GCAS and insurance lower gains and lower earnings from a smaller asset this was partially
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:12.880]   upset by lower excess interest costs and SG needs the under the quarter with 101 billion
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:19.120]   of assets excluding liquidity this was done 1 billion sequentially primary driven by GCAS
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:25.200]   due to asset sales depreciation and collection partially upset by new volume insurance assets
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:31.000]   were flat sequentially as a decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily by higher market rates
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.940]   was upset by the annual insurance with capital contribution supply chain finance assets were
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:43.740]   down as our suppliers continue to migrate to MUFG as noted earlier capital ended the
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:51.640]   quarter with 13.5 billion of liquidity capital also ended with 54.5 billion of debt which
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:59.080]   was down 4.5 billion sequentially driven by debt maturity this continued operation generated
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:05.800]   a net loss of 164 million which was unfavorable versus prior year by 200 million we still
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.320]   plan to provide the required support to GE capital in learn with insurance tax door funding
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:18.120]   next just like our businesses corporate needs to adjust our new reality and we are continuing
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:24.520]   to take additional structural action to rationalize cost and reduce the size at corporate looking
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:31.240]   at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were 374 million 8% higher but that's primarily
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.680]   due to higher intercompany profit elimination which will partially offset by better digital
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.880]   performance from continued cost reduction action functions and operations were 25%
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:48.500]   lower primarily driven by GE digital improvement you can see from digital performance that the
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:54.060]   focus cost reduction programs are getting traction we continue to right side our function cost
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:32:00.800]   across GE and push more accountability into the division Larry and I are conducting cost
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.540]   and cash reviews of each of the businesses with fresh eyes in the current environment
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:12.600]   so you can expect that they will be more to come stay tuned I have spent most of my career
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:19.180]   in leadership at lean decentralized companies fundamentally I believe companies outperform
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:24.440]   when they have a structure that empowers businesses to take the right actions quickly this type
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:30.160]   of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with COVID-19 but also
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:35.760]   to be prepared to pivot to growth we're working toward this goal and there will be more to
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:47.200]   come with us back to you Larry Carolina thank you there's no question
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:53.140]   that COVID-19 is putting real pressure on our businesses given that so much has changed
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.040]   and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure from COVID-19 I'd like to spend
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.580]   some time here discussing second quarter trending based on what we're seeing through
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:10.720]   the month of April so starting with aviation on slide nine of all of our industrial segments
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.580]   this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely the rapid contraction
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:20.040]   there travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial airlines
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:25.880]   suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets we'll cover commercial services
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.200]   and engines on the next two slides in detail but on the other end of the spectrum the man
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:36.760]   for our military business remains strong to that end we re re balanced some of our capacity
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:41.900]   to meet this increased demand to offset some pressure in the commercial business we're
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:47.400]   taking several steps that while painful preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:54.760]   to evolve we've previously announced 500 to $1 billion in costs and cash actions and
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:59.960]   we've now increased this targeting more than $1 billion in cost actions and more than $2
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:05.660]   billion in cash actions this will be achieved through different initiatives some of which
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:12.160]   have been completed others in flight as we speak these include a 10% reduction in aviation
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:18.120]   total U.S. workforce in furloughs impacting 50% of its U.S. maintenance repair and overhaul
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:25.800]   facilities and new engine manufacture will continue to monitor and potentially extend
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:32.440]   as required we're also focused on reducing the discretionary and cap expense and optimizing
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:38.880]   working capital I know aviation's decremental margin through this pandemic is top of mind
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.200]   for investors and carolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.760]   quarter while we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.880]   second quarter our expectations are that the cost actions were undertaking will improve
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.480]   decremental margins in the back half of the year while there are many uncertainties I
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.560]   expect that we will exit the year with a much lower decremental margin than what you saw
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:09.800]   in the first quarter so make no mistake thriving improvement here is our number one focus as
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.640]   we think about the full year we're tracking travel restrictions carrier and passenger
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.960]   behavior disease countermeasures and freight demand all of which will impact aircraft
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:24.720]   departures and revenue passenger kilometers while we're seeing an unprecedented decline
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.600]   in 2020 we're taking action and David and the team are working proactively with our customers
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:36.920]   to navigate through this crisis so spending a little more time on commercial services
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:42.680]   which represented 3.3 billion dollars of revenue in the first quarter let's go to slide 10
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.400]   as you can see on the left side departures across the full industry was strong in the
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:51.800]   first quarter before rapidly declining in mid-March as we look at it this week focused
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:59.200]   on the GE and CFM fleet global departures are down approximately 75% roughly 60% of
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:05.160]   the CFM fleet is parked today in line with this we're also seeing significant headwinds
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.000]   and global shop visits which were down low double digits in the first quarter as airlines
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.520]   defer short term maintenance and we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.400]   with some potential to moderate in the latter half of the year depending on the variables
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:24.740]   just outlined based on what we're seeing through the month of April in the second quarter we're
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:32.880]   seeing shop visits down roughly 60% and CSA billings down roughly 50% additionally we
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:38.880]   expect the significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure our CSA
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:45.700]   that said when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time she is well
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:52.640]   positioned with the largest and youngest install base of all engine manufacturers additionally
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:59.600]   roughly 62% of our GE CFM fleet has she has seen one shop visit or the last and this will
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:06.340]   generate demand upon recovery we have more narrow bodies that are 10 years or younger
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:11.080]   than it than the narrow body install base of the rest of the industry and when we see
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:17.920]   a pickup and air travel demand we expect narrow bodies will recover most quickly overall it
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.300]   was a challenging quarter and we're expecting additional pressure here in the second but
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:28.920]   our cost action will alleviate some of the pressure in the second half of 2020 moving
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:35.060]   to commercial engines which represented $1.5 billion revenue in the first quarter in light
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:39.860]   of COVID-19 air framers are producing at a lower rate based on what we're seeing through
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:45.400]   the month of April in the second quarter we see installed engines down roughly 45% and
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:51.680]   spare engines down roughly 60% year on year attributable to the delivery deferrals in addition
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.340]   to the already planned lower production rate on the 737 max in the near term we're right
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:04.140]   sizing production capacity and actively managing the supply base we have very strong relationships
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:09.500]   with the air framers and an attractive value proposition is evidenced by a multi year backlog
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:14.080]   as you'll see on the right we have strong positions soul source on two of the biggest
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:20.420]   new engine entrants and a 65% win rate on the other while we acknowledge there's pressure
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:26.460]   on near term demand for new aircraft these stats demonstrate the customer see the value
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:32.580]   of GE technology we're taking the right actions to be well positioned for the post pandemic
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:40.260]   world moving to healthcare which consists of healthcare systems and PDX in the second
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:45.060]   quarter today we're seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment and the diagnosis
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:50.420]   and treatment of COVID-19 within healthcare systems now these product orders including
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:56.300]   ventilators have increased one and a half to two times versus pre pandemic levels but
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:00.540]   at the same time we're seeing reduced demand for other diagnostic products as certain
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:06.140]   procedures are deferred or canceled around the world to be clear these other diagnostics
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:12.140]   are still essential and often associated with saving lives in areas including oncology and
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:19.460]   cardiology but are currently deprioritized PDX is a similar story this is a high margin
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.780]   business made up of contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with procedures that are
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:30.220]   being deferred or canceled right now several HCS product lines and most of PDX is down
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:37.300]   as much as 50% versus pre pandemic levels while these dynamics vary by country there
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:43.100]   appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies experience different stages of the virus taking
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:48.420]   China for example as hospitals come back online we're seeing a ramp in previously deferred
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:54.460]   procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables healthcare is accelerating
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:40:00.380]   its planned transformation to expand margins post biopharma by reducing headcount fixed
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:08.380]   costs discretionary spend and marketing spend prioritizing r&d deferring CAPX and optimizing
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:14.380]   working capital looking forward we're most focused on the following indicators for healthcare
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:20.060]   hospital admission and occupancy rates and increase in non COVID-19 procedures changes
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:25.340]   in hospital CAPX budgets government spending on health care broadly and development of
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:31.040]   COVID-19 test treatments and vaccines based on our experience in China and the market
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:36.340]   in April we expect to be down in the second quarter with potential recovery afterwards
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:44.020]   COVID-19 has highlighted the need to build and truly invest and and scale a new digitized
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:49.900]   infrastructure and quickly we're committed to our investment in our digital Edison platform
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:55.580]   and solutions like neural virtual care solution which allows one clinician to remotely view
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:01.440]   numerous ventilated patients simultaneously helping to expand their capacity while reducing
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:08.180]   their risk of exposure as our digital healthcare journey continues we're at the center of an
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:13.860]   ecosystem striving for precision health I'm very proud of the work our team is doing
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:22.740]   to combat COVID-19 moving to power on slide nine on slide 13 we'll talk to the current
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:29.220]   trending in the second quarter today in dynamics and gas power and power portfolio starting
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.500]   with gas power equipment while we're monitoring and managing supply chain disruptions as
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:40.420]   of today we still see a path to 45 to 50 gas turbine deliveries this year but our orders
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:45.020]   profile and therefore cash down payments worth several hundred million dollars are likely
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:52.340]   weaker due to IPP pressures in the US and Mexico is we expected deal financing will become harder
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:42:00.060]   through the year additionally with oil price pressure impacting Middle East and SSA investment
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:07.540]   including demand for new LNG we are expecting a longer road to normalization ultimately
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:13.340]   we're sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin accretive backlog with
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:19.820]   disciplined execution in services approximately 20% of planned averages are shifting from
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:24.580]   the first half of this year due to COVID-19 field labor constraints we're also seeing
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.580]   pressure on upgrades primarily in the Middle East where low oil prices are impacting customer
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:36.580]   budgets we are seeing GE gas turbine utilization in the US up mid single digits due to low gas
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:42.900]   prices in the ship from coal but utilization globally is down low double digits due to lower
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:49.900]   electricity demand within power portfolio our steam business is most impacted factory
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:55.140]   closures pressured our steam operations including one facility in Wuhan which was closed for
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:43:02.620]   approximately eight weeks in the first quarter today we're back up to more than 70% of capacity
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:07.740]   the global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in India driven by government
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:12.620]   restrictions overall we're seeing about 30% of outers shift from the first half of this
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:20.220]   year to the second half with another 10% to 15% pushing into next year our power businesses
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:24.940]   are taking several measures to offset these pressures in the first quarter we reduced
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:31.780]   head count by 700 notified approximately 1300 contractors implemented a hiring freeze
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:37.820]   and in line with the demand profile we are taking even further actions this will serve
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:45.760]   to reduce fixed costs in 2020 and drive benefits in 2021 looking forward we're tracking a number
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:51.060]   of items including timing of our gas turbine new order closure service outages in volume
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:56.180]   leak utilization is the energy mix and fuel prices are impacting each region differently
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:03.460]   supplier impacts and project execution billing milestones and customer collections we're
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:09.420]   targeting to have our accelerated cost outmeasures drive organic margin expansion despite these
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:17.620]   demand changes moving to slide 14 on renewables there was a limited impact of COVID-19 in
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:23.600]   the first quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.720]   as we've said we think about renewables and three distinct operating pools starting with
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:34.080]   onshore wind while we continue to deliver at record levels in the Americas we are seeing
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:40.100]   supply chain disruption at our LM wind facilities and we're monitoring key commercial milestones
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:46.380]   such as permitting and financing which could potentially cause timing delays in offshore
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:52.900]   wind certification for our industry leading turbine the holy odd X remains on track we're
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:59.980]   also on plan to start delivering on our 80 unit 6 megawatt commitments to EDF after completion
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:05.580]   of this project in 2021 we expect to start shifting production to the holly odd X we're
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:13.580]   also monitoring financial closure of 2020 deals grid and hydro our two turnarounds are impacted
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:17.940]   by supply chain disruptions with over half of our grid facilities now operating below
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:26.300]   full capacity and a grid automation we're also impacted by lower book to bill order conversion
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:30.660]   across all three of these pools we're increasing cost out in restructuring and we've identified
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:36.060]   several hundred million dollars of additional actions longer term a lower cost structure
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:42.780]   will benefit renewables relating to the global supply chain we're focused on the safe reopening
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:48.780]   of our plants globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels looking
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.540]   forward we're expecting a larger impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter and by business
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:59.020]   we're tracking 20 and 21 demand impact on progress collections and potential site delays
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:04.940]   in onshore wind the risk of financing delays associated with deals at offshore project
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:14.020]   site delays at grid and hydro and the backlog at grid on slide 15 within G capital or G
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:18.020]   cast and insurance businesses or where we are feeling the largest impacts so I'll keep
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:25.260]   my comments focused there first G cast is better positioned today than in previous downturns
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:31.820]   with better asset quality less customer concentration and more geographic diversity that said we're
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:37.060]   preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments as well as lease restructuring
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:43.040]   and we've had approximately 80% of our customers seek short term deferrals as you may have seen
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:50.940]   we agree with going on a rebalancing of our 737 match order book second at insurance market
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:56.260]   and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment portfolio and reinvestment
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:03.540]   yields therefore we're deploying capital to capture market dislocation investment opportunities
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:09.140]   we're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year and similar
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:13.520]   to the industrial segments we're implementing incremental cost and cash actions looking
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:19.540]   forward we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales of G cast and insurance
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:26.600]   our season teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:33.220]   so to close our priorities are clear we rapidly mobilized our team and the face of COVID-19
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:38.780]   with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees and overall the priorities
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:46.540]   we reviewed with you at the outlet call remain intact we're facing into our near term realities
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:51.620]   while continuing to manage GE for the long term when the world is facing the worst pandemic
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:48:00.660]   in a century our team is rising to the challenge with humility transparency and focus we continue
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:06.280]   to deliver value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential goods
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:13.020]   supplying vital health care equipment and keeping the lights on and while there are many unknowns
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:20.620]   there will be another side planes will fly again health care will normalize and modernize
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:26.940]   and the world still needs more efficient resilient energy at the same time we're embracing this
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:32.620]   new reality we're redefining winning and we're executing our plan the cost and cash
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:39.860]   and actions we've taken you through this morning are a major result these moves will ultimately
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:45.440]   allow us to accelerate our multi-year transformation to make GE a stronger member and more valuable
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:56.940]   company and I am confident the GE will emerge stronger with that Steve let's go to questions
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.700]   great before we open the line I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:07.440]   again and ask one question and a follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.240]   Brandon can you please open the line thank you sir we'll now begin the question and answer
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:17.420]   session if you have a question please press star one under telephone keypad if you'd like
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:21.540]   to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key if you're on
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:25.820]   a speakerphone please pick up your handset first before dialing once again if you have
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:31.580]   a question please press star one under telephone keypad and from vertical research we have
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:38.980]   Jeff Sprague please go ahead thank you good morning everyone help everyone as well thanks
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:46.700]   for all the great morning Jeff good morning I was hoping you could provide a little bit
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:52.420]   of color on how you you know kind of view the kind of the asset quality of the you
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:57.340]   know the contractual service agreements and the like there's a lot of assets there obviously
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:04.500]   there's at least a temporary impairment of cash flows how does that test work have you
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:09.000]   done it yet and are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should be thinking
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:24.900]   about Jeff I think if we look at the the service backlog right broadly just under 325 billion
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:32.700]   for the company the vast majority of that 234 billion is in aviation I suspect that's
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:41.740]   that's where your most focus we we go through those those backlog reviews and the CSA reviews
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:50.060]   on a regular basis what we've done here over the last call at the last seven eight weeks
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:58.760]   is really tighten and quicken the review process that we do with the the businesses both at
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:04.660]   aviation and a GCAS what we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest and if
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:13.020]   you will most most accurate information possible with respect to customer risk given given
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:18.060]   everything that's going on so we do that on a regular basis we did that at the at the
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:25.180]   end of the first quarter in in closing much as we do every quarter clearly we've got a
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:32.380]   we've got a fluid situation and I think the the modest charges that we took the modest
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:36.720]   changes in the first quarter clearly are going to play out as we go through the course of
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:42.620]   the year we can't really scope that for you today if you look at the CSA book in aviation
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:51.840]   for example is we went through the the mechanics of the future billings the future costs related
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:56.340]   to those billings based on the information at the time it was really just a hundred billion
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:01.420]   a hundred million dollar adjustment noncash of course which is why you see a little bit
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:09.860]   of the earnings cash dynamic certainly as we go forward we're going to be updating those
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:17.140]   adjustments and again we would expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:22.340]   are doing with with their planes but I think it's important to keep in mind again these
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:28.700]   these are 10 to 15 year agreements as you know and those adjustments are take taken
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:35.820]   in the context of that particularly extended time period great thanks for that and just
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:41.620]   to as a follow-up if I could I know you don't want to get real precise on guidance but you
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:47.420]   know you you are pointing us to a further decline in cash flow in q2 which isn't surprising
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:53.620]   quite quite frankly but could you bracket that at all for us what we should expect for for
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:59.100]   q2 and you know any high-level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:09.960]   Jeff I think that we we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and didn't want
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:16.540]   to take it an attempt at framing formal guidance here today in light of all of this flu and
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:22.860]   all of it is still evolving here I think that the tack we took was really to try to to share
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:30.360]   as much with you as we possibly could in terms of the April detail business by business and
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.940]   acknowledge that we're going to see a more challenging second quarter here given the
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:40.220]   full impact of COVID and the like but beyond that I think that's that's really where we
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:45.820]   are we we know we've got to get to work on the cost and the cash actions that's why you
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:53.420]   see us doubling that activity in aviation stepping it up elsewhere around the company so the
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:54:00.660]   two billion of cost the three billion of cash will clearly help us later on in the year
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:08.620]   is those those actions take take root but for today I think that's really what we're
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:16.460]   what we know and that's what we're comfortable sharing thanks best of luck Larry thanks
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:27.060]   from Morgan Stanley we have poker's whiskey please go ahead
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:39.040]   your line is open Josh you might be there why don't we
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:45.260]   Brandon let's let's move on and come back to Josh sure next question we have from Bank
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.900]   of America we have Andrew open please go ahead yes good morning
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:55:07.940]   thank you so much and good luck to everybody so run rate minus 60% in terms of shop visits
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:14.460]   50% on CSAs do you think you continue to trend at this level in the second quarter or is there
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:28.100]   more downside under the I think you're referring to page 9 and the slide deck yeah what we're
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:37.740]   seeing here yeah I think this is what we're what we're seeing right now right and given
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.020]   given what the carriers have said publicly what they're doing you know we think these
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:50.140]   are these are good likely near end run rates to share with you we're not trying to offer
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:54.780]   up a definitive view is to the next several quarters but this is this is what we're seeing
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:56:02.380]   right now in the second quarter for sure and my follow-up question on spare engine sales
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:11.540]   I think minus 60% have we lost these or will these come back when the situation normalizes
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:17.360]   maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about the engine demand over
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:28.100]   the next couple of years thank you so much Andrew we were we were ramping spares with
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:37.940]   with both the the leaf 1a and the leaf 1b as the narrow body market was taking off typical
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:46.700]   early in the life of an engine activity we are clearly seeing that soften not necessarily
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:54.660]   going to zero as preparations are being made for the return to service of the max right
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:58.620]   I don't think that that that opportunity is lost but I think like much of what we're
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:04.460]   seeing in aviation broadly it will be it will be pushed out for a few years and again I
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:10.620]   don't think we're taking a definitive view as to what year what quarter things get back
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:19.300]   to if you will a normalized 2019 level but we recognize the the discussion out there
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:26.340]   about this being a multi-year recovery gradual slow think we're embracing that reality and
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:34.020]   that applies really across the portfolio both on the OE side as well as the aftermarket
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:44.640]   shares included thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe thank you thank you
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:49.700]   from millions research we have Scott Davis please go ahead hey good morning guys and
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:58.020]   welcome Carolina thank you Larry any good morning Larry any any way to think about
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:03.900]   the cost actions as it relates to kind of structural versus more kind of pandemic short
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:14.020]   term related sure well I would I would say Scott if you well know that when we're in
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:21.500]   a when we're in a mode like this you're you're moving as quickly as you possibly can almost
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:26.700]   anywhere that you can so if you look at what we've announced in aviation the doubling of
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:35.020]   those activities today the broadening across the company if you look at the the tally today
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:42.140]   there is a decidedly short term bias there that Carolina and I are going to be working
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:49.580]   with the CEO's over the coming weeks to transition to a more permanent action right if you look
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:56.180]   at what we did in aviation for example example in terms of the temporary lack of works that
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:02.700]   was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure in that business on a variable basis to these
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:10.100]   shockingly fast changes in demand you might categorize that is temporary we need to work
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:17.580]   through the changes on a more permanent basis that are required in light of the the length
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:22.620]   of the recovery that we're looking at so we have confidence in these in these numbers
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:28.340]   that we're sharing today the two billion of costs the three billion of cash there's a
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:34.300]   bit of a tactical bias today just given how fresh this is but we will be leaning in toward
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:39.580]   making more than permanent recognizing that at the end of the day there will be a bit
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:47.580]   of a mix be it be it head count related discretionary spend on the cost side in addition to some
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:52.720]   of the working capital certainly the cap X reduction the Carolina reference the 25 percent
[00:59:52.720 --> 01:00:02.580]   reduction year on year so a lot going on and by no means is this these headlines today
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:10.220]   the the end it's very much a work in in progress okay that's helpful area and we think you
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:15.660]   know that the 20 billion dollars kind of came to you pretty much about perfect timing but
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:20.460]   you know is that money just sit on the ballot does it have to sit on the balance sheet pretty
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:25.260]   much as is for the for the year can you or is it just such a big number you can start
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:30.620]   to parse some of it out to you know thinking in terms of whittling down some of the you
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:44.740]   know debt that you can you can manage well we it did come at a at a good time there's
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:53.100]   no question that's why we put the emphasis in the biopharma setup on uncertainty right
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:58.060]   we want to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the the health
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:05.460]   care options Carolina anything you want to add relative to kind of managing liquidity
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:14.260]   versus leverage right here I think it's important to acknowledge that the world is different
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:19.500]   now compared to before covid and it's very important for us course leverage is important
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:26.380]   but liquidity is very important and we end the quarter with 47 billion cash right and
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:33.200]   that's really to cover 18 billion of the capital long-term debt maturity is now through 21
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.900]   and actually after the April actions we are down to 13 billion of maturity for 2021 almost
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:45.140]   all of that in in capital and I would also say you know we expect to have around 20 billion
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:50.020]   in total credit lines going forward and that's really in line with our risk appetite we have
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:57.560]   the new 15 billion three year RCF that I mentioned and five billion dollars will be on 20 billion
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.860]   of credit lines I think we just say that you know we really intend to maintain a high level
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:07.540]   of cash I would say to maximize flexibility and that's why we're taking these actions
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:14.360]   also to do risk balance and basically prudently manage our liquidity in this very challenging
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:22.820]   external environmental time that makes sense and thank you and good luck to you guys thank
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:30.180]   you thanks Scott be well and let's try Josh Porters Winsky again from Morgan Stanley
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:37.500]   please go ahead sir hi guys can you hear me this time yes yes clearly Josh good morning
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:43.460]   awesome and hope everyone is as well that go earlier comments what Larry can you just
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:49.860]   give us a sense and I know you guys have data going back eons and aviation how the impact
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:56.500]   of retirements and cannibalization you know kind of make more of a U shape versus you
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:03.420]   know what you know the air traffic may look like is there a natural lag between when folks
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:09.100]   start flying again and when shop visits can happen just as a function of kind of using
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:19.820]   up some of the runtime on otherwise idle assets well Josh certainly we have revisited the
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:26.820]   history of the team is well burst and what we have seen in years past not sure we've
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:36.660]   seen anything kind of on par with this but there's no question that there's going to
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:43.180]   be a bias on the part of some as some of these fleet reductions play out to retire some of
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:52.260]   the older aircraft and that will factor into the aftermarket much like some of the dynamics
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:58.780]   around green time and how you're in the short term folks try to preserve cash carries try
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:05.660]   to preserve cash in in their business so I'm not sure that there is necessarily an exact
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:11.740]   model that captures what all the carriers and aggregate are going to do here a model that
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:16.580]   offers great precision I think we do know that this is that the combination these factors
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:23.420]   is going to create pressure for us for us here in the short term I think what's most
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:30.700]   important for our business really is cycles much more so than revenue passenger miles
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:37.220]   and as we see schedules come back as we work our way through the pandemic that will that
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:42.020]   will put us back on I think better footing but here in the short term I think we're
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:46.820]   acknowledging that we're going to see shop visits and see if they billings take on some
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:55.180]   real pressure due to the downturn understood thanks I'll leave it there from JP Morgan
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:05:06.980]   we have Steve Tusa thanks Josh hey guys good morning hey Steve good morning in in early
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:11.300]   March you guys had that slide that showed you know two to four billion and you know free
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:15.340]   cash flow guidance which is obviously off the table but you also talked about things
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:20.340]   growing and you know 21 and 22 and you know off that kind of three billion dollar base
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:27.940]   I think you know most research and numbers I saw were kind of in that you know six billion
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:33.700]   dollar range of free cash flows the kind of growth off of that level are we still like
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:39.940]   is the are the out your numbers still at all legit or is that you know are you kind of
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:49.140]   withdrawing that long-term outlook as well Steve I think we have admittedly been focused
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:55.940]   on taking the right actions both the cost the cash the the balance sheet actions here
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:02.920]   in the short term in the face of this this unprecedented dynamic pandemic we've taken
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:08.820]   guidance off for the year we're not putting it back on today just given the given the
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:15.040]   undue uncertainty of it all right so I don't I don't think we're trying to get out any
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:21.260]   further than that I appreciate the question but I think for purposes of today we're really
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:29.100]   just trying to frame for folks what we're seeing but that said however long it takes
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:34.460]   us to work through this I think we feel very good about our ability to come out stronger
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:43.440]   and get back on a on a positive cash flow growth trajectory got Carolina anything you would
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:51.400]   add to that well no I think it's important to to acknowledge that by taking out costs
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:57.340]   now and part of it being structural that gives us sort of as well as mitigating the decrement
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:04.620]   that helps improving the incremental the outer years I mean that will depend on the recovery
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:11.620]   on the industries as well so so that's what's impossible to speak to today right and and
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:19.620]   I guess how much on that structural offside see yeah good yeah yeah I'm just just one
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:23.660]   one other point I think worth mentioning I'm I think what we're acknowledging here is that
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:28.660]   assistance played out in March and what we're seeing already in April right it really is
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:35.260]   hitting hitting us from mixed mixed perspective hard our highest margin businesses are really
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:42.980]   feeling it here I would think that on the on the recovery we would see we would see it
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:49.500]   swing the other way when we get back and come off a bottom we should have positive mix
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:58.140]   of fact it really across across the board particularly in aviation and health care your
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:04.100]   second question Steve is relative to the cost actions and how much permanent how much not
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:08.820]   permanent yeah I know I guess how much is that going to cost you I mean like you know
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:13.860]   to come up with two to three billion dollars of cost in cash you know you've done you cut
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:17.380]   your restructuring last year pretty significantly needed a couple hundred million in the first
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:23.780]   quarter I mean most companies kind of one for one what how much is this stuff going to
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:35.060]   cost you this year on a cash basis yeah I think what we have said previously we were
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:40.660]   going to be down off of last year from a from an expense and from a cash perspective I think
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:46.780]   we're probably going to end up more or less in line right keep in mind that some of the
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:55.400]   cost actions like furloughs don't carry restructuring charge with that right because they aren't
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:00.460]   permanent so part of what we're trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary cost
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:05.380]   but all the while if we can we can make more structural moves we want to make sure we've
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:10.580]   got room to do that but I'd say right now assume that it be relatively flat year on
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:18.580]   year but Carolina indicated in her remarks we want to try to do more if we can great
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:25.380]   all right thanks a lot best of luck guys thanks yes we have Marcus better bear please
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:32.860]   go ahead hi good morning Larry Carolina and Steve let me maybe follow up on the on the
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:40.660]   Marcus good morning hey good morning within the year so in your 10Q you referenced the
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:47.900]   data numbers of 48% RPK reduction is and I know obviously flight hours in RPK there
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:52.540]   are two different stories but it's not sort of a kind of scenario that you're flying
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:57.840]   through internally and I'm just trying to get a sense what that would mean if we look
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:04.460]   at our sort of like 19 aviation cash as a baseline sort of like where you know on that
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:10.020]   type of scenario we could end up particularly you know looking at sort of what you've mentioned
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:16.420]   in your preparedness remarks that you have I think 62% of of engines build ahead of shop
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:20.860]   visit one which arguably are the engines that are on the narrow bodies coming back first
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:26.540]   because they're probably the youngest youngest in the fleet right just trying to get a sense
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:37.560]   of within the year how you're thinking about that well I think that given what we highlighted
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:46.260]   relative to the April experience and the near term projection of that there's no question
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:53.220]   that we're going to continue to see the pressure on cash at aviation that we've seen here
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:11:00.660]   late right now that will be our undoubtedly our biggest headwind.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:10.320]   No sure but you know the you know shop visit be heard sort of the numbers that you that
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:18.740]   you said but did you do sort of internal internal stress tests around where you could end up
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:24.700]   with that it's not just something that you say it's too early to comment.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:34.620]   No no no there's there's plenty there's plenty of planning for again a an extended slowdown
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:41.620]   here we're embracing this reality to the fullest extent possible we are not expecting this
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:48.820]   to bounce back in the near term so we flag in the queue the Iota numbers we also reference
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:54.180]   others you see it in our own departure data here in April right we are we are we are way
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:12:01.940]   down that has a direct feed in the shop visits CSA buildings and the like so we're adapting
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:09.700]   to this new environment confident that it will recover so we're we're simply not trying
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:20.100]   to assume that the pressure abates anytime soon witness the the cost of the cash actions
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:25.860]   that we're taking sure okay no appreciate that and maybe as a follow-up quickly on on
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:32.060]   the capital side do you anticipate any change in the in the capital support therefore for
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:37.260]   insurance in particular you reference that a little bit in the prepared remarks I think
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:46.420]   2 billion is sort of the current number are you thinking about that at the moment?
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:55.940]   On the parent support to capital on the insurance let's take a step back then so in 19 the capital
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:04.900]   had an inclusion from DU of 4 billion right and the estimate for for this year is 2 billion
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:12.180]   on insurance funding and those 2 billion you know that significantly lower than the year
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:17.420]   before we estimated that the parent we need to support roughly in mind with this some
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:22.620]   variables are still open and that depends on G capital itself right to G capital earnings
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:29.340]   the LRT the capital ending assets liquidity level but basically it's about 2 billion as
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:35.820]   it looks now and I would also say going forward which is a thing of all of us we do continue
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:42.420]   to anticipate further funding and that would be against recombination of G capital itself
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:48.260]   with their assets liquidity and their future earnings and on top of that possible capital
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:52.940]   contributions from G.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:14:01.380]   Thank you from Cohen and company we have Quintana please go ahead yeah thank you good morning
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:09.620]   guys good morning two questions two questions morning so at aviation it sounds like you
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:17.580]   guys acknowledge that on the way up the spares business the aftermarket the 15 billion dollar
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:24.260]   commercial aftermarket business will lag ASM growth because of you know a younger fleet
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:31.020]   emerging you know a surge of use serviceable material in the like hard outs and obviously
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:37.580]   lower spares provisioning as the OE rates come down 30 to 50 percent I guess first question
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:45.380]   is when do you anticipate aviation free cash flow getting to break even is it even possible
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:15:01.260]   before calendar 22 in that in type of environment and then I have a follow up I'm not not sure
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:08.660]   we would buy into the premise per se right I mean we are a cycles business much more
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:16.660]   so than any other indicator and the cycles are going to have to come back before the
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:23.780]   passengers do as you indicate the age of the fleet will help us over time there could be
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:32.640]   some short term headwinds but we will see how that plays out I think what we are acknowledging
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:42.500]   here is that we have been hit from a free cash perspective in our biggest and best cash generator
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:55.140]   at aviation but we are really not getting into much more in terms of the free cash forecast
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:16:01.460]   on a multi year basis it's just too soon there is just too many moving pieces for us to be
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.700]   there before we are leaning at this point we wish we could be it's just not where we
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:13.660]   are and just to follow up obviously 2020 is a tough year we are going to have some cash
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:20.500]   burn 2021 unclear but certainly doesn't seem like an aviation we are going to have a strong
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:28.580]   recovery so as we emerge from this we are going to have more leverage and I guess the
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:34.260]   question is you guys have made some asset sales to deleverage what else besides cost
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:43.120]   reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster is there any other things that
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:48.500]   you guys are exploring or that you might explore that's different than what you've done over
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.260]   the past year thank you
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:06.380]   well I would I'm not sure I would say that there's a lot that is no please Carolina
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:18.420]   well I was going to say that to do things that we say yeah well I would just I would
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:27.380]   just say it at a high level we are committed to our deleveraging target less than two and
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:31.980]   a half times on the industrial side and I think you've seen us make a lot of progress
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:38.260]   year-to-date which I hope underscores the seriousness of that objective both on the
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:45.340]   GE side right like it's seven billion of debt reductions in the quarter and that capital
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:51.740]   hits up to 10 on a year-to-date basis given some of the things we did in April clearly
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:59.140]   is going to take us a while longer here to hit those targets like I suspect most most
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:04.340]   companies but in terms of doing anything new or different I think we're going to continue
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:09.940]   to try to run these businesses as best we can be as disciplined as we can on the capital
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:16.500]   front be smart and thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations like like pension
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:22.100]   as you've seen us relative to the plan design and some of the settlement options so I'm
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:28.060]   not sure they're necessarily new plays per se but we'll continue to look at it every
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:32.580]   and every option available to continue to strengthen the company strengthen the balance
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:40.460]   sheet bring those leverage levels down in the face of COVID-19 Carolina I'm sorry I jumped
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:46.700]   in there anything to add there I would just add to the leverage comment also the liquidity
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:51.140]   that at times like this you know you do look at the liquidity and I think it's important
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:57.540]   say that we really want to maintain a high level of cash maximizing flexibility and you
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:03.340]   have seen the de-wisking activities that we have made to sort of push out the depth
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:12.340]   in the for the years so we keep optionality thank you yeah and I but I think to that it
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:18.920]   meant it's just important for us all to remember we ended the quarter with 47 billion of liquidity
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:24.180]   on the back of the biopharma action and some of the other things that we have done so we'll
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:35.700]   continue to be nimble and flexible mindful of our obligations in our reality from Barclays
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:44.580]   we have Julian Mitchell please go ahead hi good morning maybe just a question for Julian
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:50.420]   morning maybe just the first question around the working capital dynamics in the free cash
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:57.440]   flow at aviation like this you know there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:03.380]   get this rapid sales down draft you get a working capital cash offset to an extent and
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:09.780]   then it reverses whenever the sales come back could you just update us on how you see the
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:17.540]   working capital cash impact at G aviation sort of in the early stages now in this downturn
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:23.540]   we would expect to happen to working capital when things recover and if there's any major
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:30.420]   difference on the cash dynamics of the power by the hour type service relative to the ad hoc
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:54.660]   space activity at aviation yeah on with respect to working capital I think our primary challenge
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:21:00.340]   is really inventory at aviation right we we came into this year knowing we were going
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:08.900]   to have to adjust to a different schedule with the max chasing the the step up at Airbus
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:15.780]   with the 320neo while dealing with a good bit of of past due on the commercial side
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:23.100]   both both OE and aftermarket while having pretty good military demand to to contend
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:31.140]   with that all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw promote from a cash
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:36.740]   flow perspective was an inventory at aviation in in the quarter so that that's where we're
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:42.380]   going to be most focused trying to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies adjust to
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:47.300]   the reduced production schedules the lower aftermarket requirements while continuing
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:54.740]   to take care of the military business it that's a that's a complex supply chain undertaking
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:22:01.780]   but the team as you can imagine is keenly focused on using some of the lean tools working
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:07.860]   with our supply base to make sure that we not only take the cost out of the business
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:17.820]   but bring those inventory levels down in in in light of current current demand but should
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:27.020]   we expect so I guess I understand you in this your second part of your question I may
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:34.500]   have missed that I guess you know in aviation you have the the you have the drop in EBIT
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:39.500]   DA in a downturn and the recovery in EBIT DA in the early part of the upturn I was
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:46.540]   just trying to understand on working capital is that cash impact counter cyclical or is
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:53.100]   it pro cyclical so you're getting a working capital outflow through the downturn as
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:23:05.260]   well as the EBIT DA decline I understand these the the high level
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:11.900]   dynamic there that you're alluding to I think right now the the simple reality of aviation
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:16.660]   given the pressures and across currents is that it is a negative and we need to work
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:23.500]   to improve it how much of a tailwind could it be kind of at this point in the cycle I
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:28.740]   think it's too early to tell we we we've got to get on the improvement path first Julian
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:37.300]   to be able to take that potential and deliver it in the financials as a reality thank you
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:44.100]   and then my second question was just around the the operational issues so I think it sounds
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:49.660]   like the cost out tailwind should build through the year but in Q1 you had some operational
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:55.460]   issues in in power on the on the service side you know steep decrementals even with the fixed
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:24:02.540]   cost down 16% renewables the margins were down despite a big revenue increase so I guess
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:09.500]   what's the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of these cost savings
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:15.060]   over the balance of the year?
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:21.340]   Well I think you have to take it business by business right if you look at what happened
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:31.060]   in power clearly the the push out by customers because of their own site restrictions and
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:39.020]   by us on the back of the travel restrictions really pushed a lot of high margin revenue
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:47.680]   out of the quarter and probably out of the first half that was on top of some cost pressures
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:56.060]   of our own making which we need to we need to improve upon but I think in power I believe
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:25:03.420]   that the team is doing a very nice job working off the the so called inheritance taxes driving
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:09.540]   real cost improvements you see that in the head count reductions here in the first quarter
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:13.380]   and as we get to a more normalized service environment I think you'll continue to see
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:19.620]   that that turnaround continue to to take flight I think of renewables Julian it's a different
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:28.380]   dynamic yes we had phenomenal revenue growth in the quarter double the the onshore turbine
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:35.860]   deliveries here in the US got a little bit of a little bit better price got about a point
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:39.740]   of price which is encouraging to see but it is by nature a very low gross margin business
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:48.220]   so the growth isn't high calorie unfortunately we had a few well we figure one off but they're
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:54.860]   not one off until they go away permanently cost and execution issues all the while the
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:26:00.660]   turnarounds and hydro and grid are I think moving forward but it's early days and they
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:07.820]   have a number of inheritance taxes that will take a few years to work through so I I think
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:12.580]   the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate those turnarounds in
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:19.460]   power and renewables they're dealing with different dynamics in the respective businesses
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:23.780]   and that's really why I think I have the the confidence to say that you should expect the
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:30.140]   decremental margins sequentially to improve the restructuring and the cost actions should
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:36.740]   present themselves in improved decrementals in the back half but we've got work to do
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:46.420]   to make that to make that happen great thank you from Wolf research we have Nigel Kohi
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:53.660]   please go ahead thanks Julian thanks good morning everyone and Karina great to see you
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:58.700]   on board so look we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional color in the
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:06.260]   in the queue so Larry is it now a base case that industrial free cash flow will be negative
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:12.260]   and maybe just address the risk of significant you know cash burn this year or you know is
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.460]   there enough on the on the cost outs and the working capital side to maybe mitigate some
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:23.780]   of that pressure and keep the industrial free cash you know relatively steady yeah I think
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:31.300]   what I think what we're trying to to share this morning Nigel is that you know probably
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:39.260]   three things one we've been very we've been hit hard and fast here right in some of our
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:45.500]   most important highest margin businesses be it aviation and services particularly gas
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:53.700]   power services pdx in health care we think that that gets gets worse before it gets
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:28:00.740]   better particularly here in the second quarter with a full a full effect it's uncertain
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:06.840]   as to how things play out from from here we're going to acknowledge that uncertainty hence
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:13.660]   the the pulling of the guide but we're not going to sit back and hope that it all passes
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:18.460]   we're not going to take the view that we've got a sharp debounce coming hence the the
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:23.860]   two billion of cost actions we've talked about and the three billion of cash actions we're
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:30.740]   going to do everything we possibly can to control our destiny here without impairing
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:36.980]   the the long-term value the long-term trajectory of our company so we're telling you what we
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:44.100]   know today we wish we knew more but that is really the state of play right now and and
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:48.460]   the approach the headset that we're taking to it okay I appreciate that Larry thanks
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:52.460]   and then you know I thought one of the one the real highlights of the quarter was the
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:57.180]   underlying strength of the health care margins you know X even X biopharma especially given
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:01.560]   some of the headwinds you face in there so we're seeing strength in small equipments
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:06.780]   and pressure and beguine how does that mix look though when you look at the the the the
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:11.020]   mix on smaller you know patient monitoring equipment etc versus the beguine how does
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:22.940]   our equipment mix play out to the margins well we we certainly I think the the key thing
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:38.420]   to keep in mind module is the big iron certainly got hit the lower lower ticket the lower price
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:44.420]   points be patient monitors ventilators in the light certainly got quite quite a boost
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:50.600]   but it's a small it's a small part of the of the of the business so there was a little
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:56.180]   bit of mix there but but not a lot it was really more function you know frankly of the
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:05.340]   team doing a nice job more broadly recognizing that absent biopharma we needed to tend to
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:11.740]   the core cost structure in all its form in the ACS business right we've been growing
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:17.100]   health care biopharma leading the way we got some good margin support from that business
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:22.820]   the last several years well now as we think about the 17 billion dollar core the teams
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:29.220]   really I think put their sights the last couple of quarters on growing that business growing
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:33.960]   it with accretive margins and it's really the cumulative effect that I think you see
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:39.780]   a bit here in the first quarter before we we got hit they got hit a little bit later not
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:44.600]   as much you'll see more of that unfortunately here in the second quarter but I think you've
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:49.740]   got a team who thinks that like many other med tech companies they can grow mid or load
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:57.620]   a mid single digits over time and put more digital into the mix better cost that should
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:02.980]   give us the opportunity to grow with accretive margins along the lines of what Kieran laid
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:08.300]   out in December and I have no less conviction about their ability to do that today than
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:13.700]   then we did when we made that presentation again mindful that we've got some gyrations
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:22.560]   here in the near term to deal with right okay thanks Larry good luck thanks Nigel we are
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.220]   at the bottom of the hour so Brandon we're at the bottom of the hour so we could just
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:33.340]   take one more question sure from RBC capital markets we have Dean Dre please go ahead
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:38.860]   thank you good morning everyone wishing everyone good health and I had my welcome to Carolina
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:49.700]   thank you hey just morning Dean good morning just two questions both aviation lot of discussion
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:57.260]   about structural cost out and Larry be interested in how have you balanced the structural cost
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:04.700]   out in aviation with rifts and balancing the rifts and furloughs versus how you might
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:11.540]   be compromising the ability to bounce back when it does ramp back up so that's the first
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:16.180]   question and then the second one just to make sure I heard it correctly were there did you
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:23.040]   quantify the leap cancellations in the quarter I know there's delivery deferrals our experience
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:29.020]   in 2008 was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations because customers would
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:34.820]   lose that nonrefundable deposit so what's the expectation here in terms of engine cancellations
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:48.640]   that's it for me thank you maybe I'll take the first part of that and perhaps Carolina
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:57.660]   can take the second I think we are mindful ever mindful that there will be a recovery
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:01.200]   right we and we want to be well positioned for it's going to be very good business for
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:13.900]   GE for four decades but I think we are really trying to again embrace our reality and take
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:21.900]   the cost actions in the aftermarket business and more broadly at aviation mindful that
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:28.140]   we've got a period of time here of an unknown duration but it's not going to be measured
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:33.740]   in months right where that business is going to be under considerable pressure so after
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:41.680]   a period of time is the aftermarket has grown as it has the last decade this is going to
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:50.540]   give us an opportunity to rethink to consolidate all the while mindful of our obligations to
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:58.020]   customers the nature of how the footprint has changed the changes that are still coming
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:03.620]   so there are a number of variables it's very much a work in progress as well but I think
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:11.380]   we've got line of sight to build on some of the temporary action to take permanent action
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:19.180]   to make sure that we have a lean cost structure with adequate capacity to come out of the
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:24.380]   downturn here well positioned to perform both for customers and for investors.
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:30.340]   Thank you we'll now turn it back to Steve Whitaker for closing remarks.
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:40.380]   Do you want me to answer the question on yeah go ahead Carolina go ahead Carolina.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:47.220]   Yeah you were right because I actually mentioned that in my notes that in our backlog which
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:55.180]   was flat sequentially and up 22% versus prior that did include roughly 200 loop 1B unit
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:35:02.220]   order translations in the quarter what I would say the progress we've found are very small
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:07.780]   so far but on top of that we also saw GCAS right so we have GCAS cancellation of 69
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:19.800]   in April so that will be reflected in the second quarter evaluation backlog.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.980]   Great thanks everybody I know I know it's a long call and a busy day so if you need more
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:33.260]   just reach out to us and have some luck.
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:40.660]   Thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference thank you for joining and

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   The as reported financials only include the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment results
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   from the closing date of the transaction on February 29, 2020,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and the supplemental financial information provides results as the transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2018
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   to provide a full quarter of comparable results.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Turning to slide 3, on today's call we will provide an update on the top priorities of the company in the current operating environment
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as review our first quarter total company and segment highlights.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We will conclude today's call with the Q&A session.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   At this time, I will now turn it over to the Santerranol Chief Executive Officer.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Thank you and good morning to everyone on the call.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I would like to kick off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by COVID-19
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and all the dedicated healthcare workers, public responders and volunteers who are on the front lines
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   all over the world battling this pandemic.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll Rand employees around the world.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The pictures on slide 4 are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   who have adapted to the realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Every day I hear of new examples of our businesses providing mission critical products to our customers
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   one thing I am sure about is that Ingersoll Rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and serving our customers at the center of everything we do
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Moving to slide 5, I would like to grant everyone on the critical priorities we are following during these challenging times.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   When we close the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   that within a matter of weeks we will be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruptions to our customer supply chain
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   and the day-to-day operations of the company.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us to plan, accelerate and adapt our actions
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers and the community.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   through these uncertain times.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And finally continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The strength of Ingersoll Rand team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge from this crisis
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   as a stronger and more unified company.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine that we call IRX
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   are really at the heart of how we operate as a company, especially in these unprecedented times.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   During the integration process we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   One that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   This purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams leave on a daily basis creates a framework
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   of what we want to achieve as a company and the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll Rand Execution Excellence process.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll Rand.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Turning to slide seven, I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   since it has been swift and focused around two major components.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   First is the health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And second business continuity not only within operations but across a larger supply chain.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Starting first with health and safety we activated our COVID-19 tax force in February
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   and had a full coordinated company approach in early March just weeks after the creation of the new company.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Our execution approach has served us very well as we are able to quickly implement enhanced site safety protocols
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And it is encouraging that our quick actions have been successful as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   But it is more than just implementing safety protocols, it is also about supporting and engaging the employee base.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   As a result we have implemented a number of measures including a global outreach program to facilitate employee feedback.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Not only did our team volunteer to take individual pay cuts, furloughs and forego vacation time this year,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   they have thoughtful in-depth suggestions, many of which were actively implementing today.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   For our business continuity perspective starting first with our operations as we previously communicated
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   we have seen plans largely in China, Italy and India impacted due to COVID-19.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   China was largely impacted in the month of January and February and has seen steadily improved capacity
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and output through March and into April as things are now largely back to normal.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Italy and India saw about a two month delay to China with operations being impacted in late March and into April.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And in this time our sites around the globe are 98% operational with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The supply chain has seen a similar trend as the impact in China is largely behind us
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   The Americas and India regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   In the past few weeks we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Much like our operations India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of May when governmental restrictions begin to ease.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   We are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Let me tell you about what we're doing here.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Starting with slide 8 through the use of IRX we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over $350 million
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   with increases across all major savings categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   As a reminder we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost energies
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   of approximately $250 million by the end of year 3 after closing.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energies
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and the associated stand up of the new company.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters the facing of synergy delivery
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   We have dramatically increased the pace having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   with approximately $70 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The majority of these savings are coming from head count actions already taking in the past two months
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   In addition we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative with RFQs for nearly one third
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   of our historical direct materials fan base already launched as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   In total we are now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of 10% to 15% realization.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   We are keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three year time frame
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   at this time to remain prudent on volume dependent synergies like procurement
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and I have to be given the current environment.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   This is not only the structural cost that we have taken out but also how we are supplementing
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short term cost reductions to protect margins.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So let's move to slide nine to talk about that.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   In Q1 despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   we were able to limit adjusted EBITA decrementals to less than 30%.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   With the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   We expect that these additional actions will yield $40 to $50 million of incremental cost savings
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   in the PNL this year with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   We will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if the man environment does not accelerate
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   in the second half of the year we will potentially extend some of these actions
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and increase our savings target accordingly.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   While we are making some top decisions to control cost,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   one area that we are not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Much like we did back in 2015 at Georgia Denver when we invested through the downturn
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   to capitalize on market share gains and new growth opportunities.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   We are following the same playbook today.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as demand generation
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and our IoT platforms.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   This is all part of the strategy to play offense,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   now especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Moving to slide 10, let me talk about liquidity.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   At the time of the merger we took the opportunity to reprise our legacy debt
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   by placing the new $1.9 billion dollar term loan to close this transaction.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   All of our debt is a term loan B structure
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   with very attractive pricing as the U.S. components are LIBOR+175
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   and the Euro component is a Euro board +200.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The term loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   and there are no maturities until 2027.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   as we finish the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and over $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   As we look ahead we continue to see several opportunities to own the cash
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Opportunities exist across working capital and cash taxes
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   in the second half of the year as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   will expire by September of 2020.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   given the attractive rate and covenant environment.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Turning to slide 11, our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   as we're building the culture of Ingersoll Rand with our employees at the core.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and preserve liquidity and at the same time we will position the company
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   for future growth both organically and through opportunistic targeted Bolton M&A.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Our business operates in a very fragmented market
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and importantly our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   is taking shape as we launch several of our ESG oriented initiatives already.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Overall we have several value creation levers as we look ahead
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain microeconomic landscape.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I will now turn it over to Emily to work you through the financials.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Emily?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Thanks Vicente.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   On slide 12 you will see the as reported financials for the company.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   As a reminder the reported financials include three months of legacy Gardner Denver
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and one month of the legacy Ingersoll Rand industrial segment in Q1 2020
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   As a result the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Other than to mention that the as reported net income in the quarter
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   includes $197 million of amortization, acquisition, restructuring and other adjustments
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Turning to slide 13 to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   as if it had happened as of January 1, 2018.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   From a total company perspective FX suggested revenue and orders declined 14%
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Regionally we saw notable declines in Asia Pacific
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   as well as sharp declines in the U.S. and Europe towards the end of the quarter
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   most notably in the ITNS segment.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   This led book to bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   The company delivered 208 million of adjusted EBITDA as a decline of 24%
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   driven mostly by the volume declines in ITNS and the expected downturn in the HPF segment.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4% down 200 basis points from last year.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   However our proactive cost controls within the business limited decrementals to 29%.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   the legacy Gardner Denver business delivered 97 million
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately 100 million
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   The legacy IR businesses delivered 51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   as opposed to a combined 60 million for January and February.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Moving to slide 14, pre-cash flow for the quarter was 60 million dollars
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   on an as reported basis including 8 million dollars of CAPEX.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   The Q1 pre-cash flow includes 63 million dollars of outflows related to the transaction
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   comprised of 38 million of synergy delivery and standup related costs
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   and another 25 million of transaction fees.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   We have also paid 38 million dollars of debt issuance costs in the quarter
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   bringing our total transaction related outflows in the quarter to 100 million dollars.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   From a leverage perspective we finished at 2.6 times
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   and while we do expect to see some short term increase to leverage
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   we have shown the ability to delever historically.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   The right side of the page will remain extremely disciplined on cash
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   with what you have seen historically.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Specifically, internal reinvestments for growth,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   prudent debt pay down and opportunistic bulls on M&A.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   We have no plans for any share repurchases or dividend at this time.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segment. Vicente?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Thanks Emily.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Starting first with industrial technologies and services on slide 15
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   the IT&S segment first quarter adjusted order intake was 889 million dollars
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   down 9% versus per year excluding effects.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Adjusted revenue in the quarter was 796 million dollars
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   down 17% excluding effects
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and leading to a book to bill ratio of 1.12 times.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   From a regional perspective Asian Pacific revenues were down in the mid 30s
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   with Europe down 15% and Americans down 7% all excluding effects.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   We use this trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   meaning that the APAC declining Q1 is what we expect to see in America's anemia in the near term.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   but we're staying highly active with the man generation activities and pricing controls
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   but we continue to demonstrate disciplining price generating over 1% in the quarter.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   While these markets are more opaque than historically we're using our unique data acquisition strategy
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We break this out into two areas aftermarket and original equipment.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   For aftermarket and leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   that are connected to our remote monitoring systems.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   In America and Europe we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few weeks of March
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   of nearly 30% with some recovery in the past few weeks of April.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   We're now using these as a way to know where our service teams need to focus
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   which is approximately 50% of the compressor business today.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   For original equipment we're using the man generation leads.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   We said in the past that the man gen was a leading indicator of orders
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   With more than a thousand leads per week we have a lot of commercial insight in our system.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   What we saw in the later weeks of March was a drop of 30% versus what we saw earlier in the quarter
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   with similar trends in America and Europe.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   but still approximately 20 to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers and vacuums
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   where we saw orders down in the mid to high single digits.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   We have spoken about third party industry reports in the past
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   According to a leading third party report the market in the U.S. was down mid-single digits in dollars in the first quarter.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Gardner Denver branded products were flat and Ingersoll brand branded product was down high single digits
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   but when you look into the details you see the power of the two companies.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Gardner Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   while Ingersoll brand took share on high horsepower compressors.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   as well as the direct and indirect channels that both companies have.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Power tools and Lyft which is part of this segment had a very tough quarter
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   with orders and revenue down both over 20%.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   that online retailers typically make in the first quarter to support first half of the year revenue.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   However, this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   many online retailers switch their focus to household essentials.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Moving to non-gap at Yotar Ibiza IT&S delivered 135 million dollars in the quarter
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   which was down 25%.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Non-gap at Yotar Ibiza margin was 17% which was down 150 business points
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   from the prior year.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Other cost mitigation efforts helped limit incremental to 25%
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   in a segment that typically has basic fundamentals of 35% to 40% before cost actions.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Moving to slide 16 to the precision and science technology segment.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Overall the segment had solid performance in this economic environment
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   as adjusted orders were 218 million up 2% XFX.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Adjusted revenue was 192 million down 9% XFX.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   On strong prior year comes up 12% XFX growth and shipment delays due to COVID-19.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   In the first quarter we saw orders growth high single digits
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   in the legacy medical pump business as we are leading key player in several applications
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   like oxygen concentrators respirators and liquid handling.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into at the bottom of the page.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Our team have been working 24/7 providing modified solutions
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   that can be used for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down 2% XFX
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   with the majority due to COVID lockdowns in January and February in China
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and towards the end of the quarter in India.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in the more industrial end markets.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Moving to non-gap adjusted EBITDA PNST deliver 53 million down in the quarter which is down 6%.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Non-gap adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7% up 120 basis points
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   driven by strong cost controls and productivity leading to incremental margins of only 15%.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Moving to slide 17 and the specialty vehicle technology segment
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   the priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   We see that this segment can expand margins with the use of the same IRX tools
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   we have used across other segments and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Adjusted orders were $230 million and adjusted revenue was $185 million
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   up 8% and 7% respectively with a boost to bill of 1.15.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Growth was driven by the strength in gold connectivity and consumer product lines.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   The business saw strong double digit order momentum in early January and February
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   but as the pandemic hit the U.S. we saw sharp decline in the second half of March.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   What there is a lot to be excited about we are expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple reasons.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   First, last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   where some product was shifted to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And two, the business is not immune to this current environment
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   while April orders were down year over year, we are starting to see some sequential improvement in orders.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   We feel this is driven by a couple factors.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   First, in the consumer product line, the team people took quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques widely used in the legacy industrial businesses
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And second, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Moving to non-gap adjusted EBITDA, specialty vehicles deliver $18 million in the quarter down 1%.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Non-gap adjusted EBITDA was 9.9% which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth, investments and product mix.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Moving to slide 18 and the high pressure solution segment,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   the business performed above our expectations in a tough operating environment
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   with adjusted orders of $84 million and adjusted revenues of $96 million.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Down 26% and 29% respectively.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   As expected the revenue base in the business was nearly 90% aftermarket
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   and the team executed very well commercially with sequential adjusted orders up 6%
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and sequential adjusted revenues up 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   We continue to see shared gain opportunities in aftermarket
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   and specifically consumables where we saw orders and revenue up double digit sequentially.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   This allowed us to deliver non-gap adjusted EBITDA of $24 million and margins of 24.6%
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   which was down from last year level of 30.8% but sequentially better by over 400 basis points.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   As we pivot to the second quarter and rest of the year,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   We can measure that in multiple ways but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   As a reminder each fracked fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   With each truck carrying one pump, each pump has a fluid end and every fluid end utilizes consumables.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   With Q1 2020 on average we saw 318 active fleets, the exit rate in March was 240.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter where we believe 50 active fleets
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   due to the recent dynamics in the market with the oversupply and lower pricing for oil sinful impact on revenues within this segment.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Because of that we are taking very proactive stand to drive proper cost takeout
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Moving to slide 19 we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of growth.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Overall the total company is down approximately 20% in orders
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   as the month began very slow particularly in U.S. and European markets.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   By the order momentum throughout April we expect total revenue to be low
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   in terms of orders both industrial technology and services and specialty vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   While precision and science technology is performing considerably better
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   with positive year over year orders performance thus far as a result of continuous strength in medical pumps.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And not surprisingly the high pressure solution segment is down as the market resets
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   for what will likely be a prolonged downturn that we expect will last for a number of quarters.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   As we look forward due to the uncertain environment that we found ourselves in
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   we will not be providing Q2 or total year to best manage our business
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   and ensure we are taking the right steps to manage multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   and the associated impact on cash flows.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Our current model shows that the business will be on an annual basis
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   to be cash flow break even using fairly conservative assumptions
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   around working capital and capital coupled with the cost of actions we have taken thus far.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   We feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   when compared to current order trends and coupled with our current liquidity position.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Apprentices like 20 for some concluding remarks
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I want to say that what we manage through what we will know that will be a tough second quarter
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   we feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has not changed.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Ingersoll Brand is a premier industrial company over transformation.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   We have multiple levers for accelerating biocreation
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   but being very focused on the current part of our liquidity
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   with opportunities to increase these by unlocking cash as well as taking advantage
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   of the current rate environment.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   We will continue to drive a culture of execution
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   and we continue to pay attention to the particular under current conditions
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   to be strategic and both on acquisition.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   For this we will turn to the Q&A.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   At this time I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   number one on your telephone key pad.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   If you would like to remove yourself from the queue you may press the pound
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   yourself to one question and one question.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Your first question comes from Andy Kapilitz from Citigroup.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Your line is open.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Good morning guys, how are you?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Good morning Andy, how are you?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Vicente can you give us more color into the April order declined
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   you're seeing in your largest segment in ITNS.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   First of all how long do you think the change in customer behavior from that power tools business
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   now have smaller ups and downs compared to exposure in ITNS?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So are there discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   given they're more project versus the industrial compressor business?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Yeah Andy let me just give you a little bit of color.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   As you saw we said roughly April total order is down 20%,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   book to bill greater than one.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   From a book to bill perspective the industrial technology
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   and the precision and signs were greater than one and obviously leading the way.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I'll say in terms of ITNS in particular I will categorize it as the short cycle
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   was mostly most impacted in the quarter and continue to see some relatively
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   weakness here moving forward.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   It's mostly correlated to I guess maybe the PMI from the down and the mainstream
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   which is what we consider to be more on the long cycle.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I'll say comparatively a bit more stable in the first quarter
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and we continue to see maybe some of that in the month of April.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Again typically we tend to get the orders for that long cycle now in the first half of the year
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   in order to get shipment in the second half.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And from a PTO from a power tool perspective yeah I mean rough quarter in Q1
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   as I alluded I mean last year there were seeing some fairly good growth momentum
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   from their expansion into online retailers and you saw that in the first quarter
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   many of these online retailers they moved to having other kind of more household goods
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   or critical needs to fight COVID 19 and clearly you know this business
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   saw some of the impact.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   I'll say April sale is relatively slow so we haven't seen the people
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   that were the momentum of the power tool business.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   So that's helpful Vicente and I'm sure you especially asked about decremental margin
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   in some way so let me just ask it like this.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Obviously good result in Q1 of close to 30.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   How do I think about decrementals with high pressure solutions,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   you know the orders down 80% can you hold decrementals there in the mid 40s
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   at what point the fixed cost become a problem.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I know you talked about accelerated the rest of the business.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Can the rest of the business hold 30% decrementals
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall in the rest of the business?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Yeah so I'll say Andy I mean that's kind of what we're targeting for
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   and I mean as you have seen you know we have performed well in the down cycles
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   in the past I think we have a good solid playbook that we executed
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   in the 1516 that included both not only in the industrial downturn
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   but also an upstream downturn.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   You know basic decrementals they tend to be around 40% across the business
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   with slightly higher in businesses like the high pressure as you mentioned
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   as well as the precision and science because of the nice high gross margins
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   that those businesses have and you know lower on the specialty vehicles
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   and the industrial technologies they tend to play in that kind of 40% range.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   You know you've seen that we have taken very decisive actions
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   between synergies and the short term actions to protect the margin.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   We saw as you mentioned you know some very good first quarter results
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   for the total business under 30% and Q2 will clearly see a bit more pressure
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   from a top line perspective but we will continue to manage the decrementals
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   with the target being closer to that 30% of the EBITDA
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   and you know when you think about the actions we're clearly taking
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   much more aggressive actions and the high pressure around cost actions
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   based on what we see here with a lot of our data points
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Very helpful to send this stay well.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Your line is open.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Hi. Good morning.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Morning. Maybe just a first question on that point on decremental margins.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   So if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   through the year and also of that 40 to 50 million of other cost out actions
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   and should those mean that decremental margins narrow
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   or not necessarily depending on your mix and some other things?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Maybe break it down into the two buckets as you suggested.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   The 40 to 50 that we spoke about that are kind of more related
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   to discretionary or kind of volume related those are largely second quarter
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   with a good majority I would say more so on the second quarter
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   from the cost synergy perspective.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Million dollars out of 80 to 90 million dollars of in year
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   rough account and I would say that is kind of consistent
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   third quarter and fourth quarter
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   while the other roughly 10 to 20 million dollars that comes from procurement
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   is really more weighted towards that kind of Q3 and Q4.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Then maybe just my second question for you all for Emily around the free cash flow.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   You had a good performance in Q1.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Just wondered you had assumptions around break even free cash
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   but assumed play out.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   What kind of sales are down call it 20, 25% for the year?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   What type of free cash flow conversion should we expect?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   How do you see working capital moving?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   You had I think in the free cash that 63 million dollars
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   of transaction and separation cash cost in Q1.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   What's the rough assumption for the year?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Yes, we're very pleased with the Q1 cash performance
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   as you saw there Julian and we've been managing cash
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   from
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   to put in good processes and strong controls around it
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   given the current crisis.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   We expect cash to still be to move forward
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   but certainly a longer cash cycle
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   as we move through.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   We're really managing payments
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   as the collections we're receiving
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   What the future holds,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   a lot of that's going to depend on
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   for sure but we know
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   we'll maintain our cash position and our liquidity.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   How about the costs?
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Any very rough guide post for the year
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   in light of that 63 million in Q1?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   There'll be some incremental cash.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   I don't have the figure
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   at my fingertips at the moment Julian
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   but I can get back to you on that.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Your next question comes from Michael Hollerang
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   from Baird.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Morning everyone, hope everyone's doing well.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Could we just talk about the synergy funnel you referenced?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   What are some of the incremental sources
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   that you originally identified 250?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Maybe talk about the differences you're seeing
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   in the longer term some of the revenue
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   synergy opportunities you're seeing.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   As you recall we always said
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   that we were going for
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   60 days into the transaction.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   We have always their visibility
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   as to what that funnel could potentially be.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Roughly $100 million comes from
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   a combination of structural savings
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   as rationalization, non-manufacturing
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   that's alluded to on the investor side.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   We have now pretty good database
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   of all the locations across the world
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   and that is giving us a very good way
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   for us to really understand and rationalize
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   not so much the amount of money
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   coming year two or year three
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   but more the other kind of perspective.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   So second part of the question,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   liquidity is in a strong position.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Some of the one off things is operation
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   and some of the extra things I'm only just referenced.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   What would it take for you guys
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   to be a little bit more aggressive
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   with the cash out flow
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   and then secondary area related to that
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   we're going into some sort of recession here?
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   Who knows how long.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   The opportunity is going to accelerate
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   to deploy capital more toward the M&A side
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   of things over the next couple of years
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   and are you positioned for that today
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   and any kind of thoughts
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   and how you're thinking similarly
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   about that capital side
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   over the next six, nine plus months?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   No, absolutely Mike.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   I think clearly over the next couple of years
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   continue to be a really hard part of our strategy.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   We see it's a very unique environment right now.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   We still see at this point in time
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   some very good funnel also very good funnel
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   around industrial technologies
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   but there are really more related towards both ends.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Your next question comes from Nigel Koh
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   from Wolf Research.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Your line is open.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   Good morning.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   How are you guys?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Good afternoon.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Yeah, good thanks.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   We'll take performance.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   A little bit of performance
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   and it seems like most of that came from the legacy IR businesses.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Maybe just kind of fell out in a bit more detail.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   How much of that can be explained
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   by the jokes of the industrial of the IR?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Also, what happened to service during the quarter?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Nigel, what happened to what?
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Yeah, what happened to service?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   I think I mean China was definitely impacted
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   largely in January and February.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   The legacy IR business,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   they have a pretty sizable China exposure.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   In terms of the service,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   we saw service better.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Typically we saw roughly about two times
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   from a percentage perspective
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   better performance than the original equipment.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   particularly as you know,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   ways of comparing some of the,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   you know, the industrial technology
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   is composed of multiple technologies,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   compressors, backings and blowers.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   And our compressor business is clearly within the --
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   when we specifically compare to some of the competitors,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   there's a couple of data points
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   that we look at in terms of the third party report.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   At the same time, you know,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   just to give you a further perspective,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   the legacy Gardner Denver business in Q1,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   orders were down in the low single --
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   so in the market.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And, you know, since we didn't own the legacy IR
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   for the full quarter,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   we just tend to not comment on what we saw specifically --
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   January and February that they saw from an order perspective.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   But that hopefully gives you a good perspective
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   as to how we perform even on the legacy GD.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   All right, thanks.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   This has become so small now.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   There's so much involvement.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   But if it is down 8% in the quarter,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   that implies, you know,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   I mean, is it possible to break --
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   given that you're clearly expecting this business
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   to be kind of like weaker for longer,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   would you expect revenue to kind of like just bounce along
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   and drop here for the next several quarters?
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   I mean, any kind of that would be helpful.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Yeah, and so for sure, you know,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   that's what we're targeting to be, you know,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   the breakeven and even positive.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   I mean, we're taking some pretty aggressive actions.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   100% after market and consumable.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   So that kind of carries a much better margin profile too as well.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And, you know, those factories that are kind of not needed
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   because they're based on volume.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I mean, we're basically keeping them close
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   or very, very low exposure.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   So yeah, good playbook on how to not be --
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   have done extensive work.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   And, you know, I think we see that we can definitely overcome
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   these kind of long-term requirements.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Our plan is that it's going to be down for a while.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And to the second question, you know,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   I mean, clearly it's a market that, as you saw,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   we just invested in new fluid and technology.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   So, and, you know, we can be ready for capturing.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Great. Thank you very much.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Our next question comes from Jeff Sprott
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   from Vertical Research Partners.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Good morning, Jeff.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Why don't we just come back to service for a moment
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   and send a interesting comment about utilization down 30 percent.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   But how do we actually interpret and apply that to a forward
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   when our sales are going to be down 30 percent
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   and the service, as I don't believe?
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   I don't know if you have enough data historically
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   to kind of piece that together,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   but what does that down 30 percent tell you?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Yeah, Jeff, great question.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   So, in terms of the historical data,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   we don't have a lot of historical because, as you know,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   as you can imagine, a lot of these remote monitoring systems
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   and connectivity with the IoT platforms
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   that we both companies have now is fairly new.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   But we have enough data to then break it down
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   by the specific sub-end market.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   The indication here is that it's telling us
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   where are those markets that we should continue to play
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   or double down from a service perspective.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   So, it's helping us to redirect the teams.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   It is also helping us to really better serve our customers
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   and making sure that we're still more resilient
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   from that perspective.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   You know, in terms of being down 30 percent,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   I mean, I think we just see that as a bit of indication
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   as to what could happen here,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   but as you gave us a great correlation
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   as we don't have a lot of historical data to...
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   So, what we're doing is just taking that data point
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   and focusing them on those areas,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   regions and markets that we're still seeing
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   some very good utilization of the compressors.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   And any answers?
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   You noted ITS obviously includes more than compressors back...
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Are you suggesting that those other product areas
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   outside of vaccines and blowers were substantial?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   Yeah, so for sure the power tools and the lifting business
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   was one that was worse than that.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   I mean, the power tools, they have two main product lines.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   I mean, it's that tool business,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   but also they have a lifting business
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   that is kind of more related to factory consumption
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   or factory rationalization.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   So, I think that was impacted more so.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   And then China as a region was definitely heavily impacted.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   And, you know, from the other product lines
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   in terms of the longer cycle,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   which these are kind of brands like Nash and Carroll,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   LiquorGreen Ponds and LiquorGreen Vacuums,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   those are more longer cycle
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   and those were I'll say more stable and resilient.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Great, thank you.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   Your next question comes from David Rosso from Evercore ISI.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Your line is open.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Good morning.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   My question is about in the ITF's inventory in the channel
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   and you think about some of the recent improvement you've seen,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   can you give us some sense on any sequential improvement,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   sort of a lead lag and also the mix of your businesses
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   being short cycle versus long cycle?
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Can you just give us some sense of the inventory in those channels?
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   The lag you would need to see
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   or that you would experience if say the PMI's got better, for example?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Yeah, David, I think, you know,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   when we look at the inventory in those channels,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   I mean there's just not quite this from a compressor perspective
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   which is obviously the one that has the biggest size
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   of the distribution network
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   and it is also more particularly towards the Garner Denver branded products.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   You know, we don't tend to have a lot of inventory
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   because these are particularly smaller distributors,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   more sub-regionalized, more localized.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   They don't tend to put a lot of cash upfront
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   to have compressors on the shelf, so to speak.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   I mean maybe on the smaller compressors they may,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   but not on the medium to high level compressors
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   and the inventory will come in more on consumables after market
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   really moves fairly well. I mean they turn fairly quickly.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   You've seen just how clear
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in ITS
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   or have you seen some little improvement in order sequentially
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   and I'd be curious, is that more short cycle or long cycle?
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Yeah, I know, great question.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   It is out categorized as stabilization initially
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   and then obviously when you look at it within the month,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   I mean at the month of April,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   there's some slight improvement on the second half of April.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   But again, was that more short cycle improvement?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Short cycle, yeah.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Short cycle, alright, thank you very much, appreciate it.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Sure.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Your next question comes from Josh Pokolinsky.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Hi, good morning all.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Good morning Josh.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   So this afternoon I guess everyone here on the call
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   kind of had the same list of questions
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   so we covered a lot of ground already.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   But I guess just with some of the commentary around utilization
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   and with the comments you made around supply chain and eruption,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   how much of the decline you're seeing
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   I guess this comment is mostly in IT and that's comment,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   is related to customer shutdowns or supply chain and eruption
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   and in some form like the lights come back on
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   and a certain amount of demand comes back
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   because I think to some of these points on service or utilization
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   that maybe that's not the steady state of the world there.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   Yeah Josh, I'll say more so in China.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   If you want to think about it kind of that disruption completely.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Also in the first quarter maybe some disruption
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   from the perspective in Europe particularly in Italy.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   I mean we do have some very good manufacturing days in Italy
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   and although we stayed operationally I mean most of our suppliers
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   had to shut down.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   I would say that now as kind of the comment that I made before
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   we see kind of days lower the demand level getting more stabilized
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   but still not seeing that kind of recovery
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will play out.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Okay and then switching over to the synergy funnel
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   I mean it sounds like the year three pipeline of activity
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   can ask to stay there as you have to act on other things first
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   since we're manufacturing centric.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Fair to say that the incremental step up in synergies
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   then into year two is it's smaller?
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   I guess is this more of a pull forward from year two
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   or are you kind of implicitly saying hey we think there's more than 250 here
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   we're just working on this as fast as we can
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   and we'll update you as we know more.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Yeah I think that's exactly the case.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   We want to keep it at 250 just because we think it's prudent
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   and we think it's prudent because we're clearly focused on a lot
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   of the internal funnel and execution
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   you see how we accelerate it and we execute it
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   I mean this is not just talking about how we execute it
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   but there's a component around procurement and an I2V savings
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   innovative value that is non-independent
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   and when we did the $250 million cross synergy funnel
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   it was done based on 2019 kind of runway level
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   so to speak on spend levels so we just want to be prudent
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   from kind of going out there and saying that the $250 will increase
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   you know once we're ready we'll definitely
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   and when we see more stability or normalization in the markets
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   maybe we come back with that
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   but at this point in time we're accelerating what we can control
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   and we know that we can control that structural head count out
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   and that's exactly what we executed
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   we know we can control a lot of the quickings in procurement
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   because commodities are lower and we are executing that
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   and we know we can control a lot of discretionary spend
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   and that's exactly what we also executed
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   so we're very focused on kind of going through the list
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   of things that we can really execute
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Great, appreciate the call
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Steeple
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Your line is open
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Good morning everyone
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   Good morning Hank
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   We are revenue down 8.6 to XFX
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   margins up 120 basis points
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   so clearly some very good control left
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   on what drove the very good decrementals there
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   how do you see the decrementals going forward
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   and maybe any color you can give us
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   on what you think the long term margin opportunity is
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   in that business
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   Nathan this is I will say some very good cost control
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   but also some very good momentum
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   that we had also from the medical business
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   if you remember last year when we talked about the medical business
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   we were seeing upwards of 200 basis points margin improvement
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   and the medical business finishing last year at roughly 30-31% EBITDA margin
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   so again very good momentum from that business
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   and clearly as we saw some softening in the market
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   the team continued to execute those targets that they needed to get done
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   you know I think when you look at this business
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   that has some very nice gross margins
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   and the decrementals, the phase decrementals
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   are typically 45 or so
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   I mean pretty good job that the team did here
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   in order to get the decrementals down to the 15%
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   and I'll say from a long term perspective
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   we'll definitely come back
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   with giving some kind of medium to long term perspective
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   I'll just do a quick comparison
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   and you can see that medical we were able to
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   not only just a few years ago
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   the medical business was in the 25%, 26% EBITDA margin
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   and we finished last year in the 31% EBITDA margin
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   and there's just a lot of good commonality
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   between the medical and the legacy
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   PFAS and ARO business that are within this segment
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Okay maybe just one on receivables
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   and when you look through that
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   do you see any customer credit risk
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   any collection risk there
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   I guess it's particularly an upstream comment
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   given the way that market's going
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   but anywhere else you see any potential issues in receivables
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   how you're going about managing customer credit
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   those kinds of things
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   I'll say none necessarily Nathan
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   I think it's one that we live by day by day
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   clearly on the high pressure solution
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   customers are still paying
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   they take longer to pay but they still pay
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   they also realize from an upstream perspective
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   that our business is critical and essential
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   for when the market comes back up again
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   so we have been pretty strict in many cases
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   that we need to see the payment
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   or we will stop shipment
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   and then we cease to provide any type of
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   output of products either now or later in the future
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   so I think we're really executing a good label here
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   on collections with the teams
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Excellent thank you
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   Thank you
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   Your next question comes from Nicole DeBles
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   from Deutsche Bank
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   Your line is open
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   Yeah thanks good morning guys
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   Good morning Nicole
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   So a lot of this has been answered
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   we covered a lot of ground so far
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   but I just wanted to ask one
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   into next year as we think about approaching our recovery
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   we've got more structural cost savings
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   coming through presumably
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   you have temporary costs probably coming back to the business
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   and then just kind of dovetailing all of that
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   with typical incremental margins
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   I'm not sure how best you can do this the same day
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   but it would be really helpful to kind of characterize the way
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   you see incrementals coming out
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   on the other side of this downturn
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   Yeah Nicole, that's great
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   I think we typically see kind of the base
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   what I call the base level of incremental
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   for the total business between 35% to 40%
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   Again when you look at precision and science
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   maybe higher than that
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   specialty vehicles lower than that
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   with maybe industrial technologies about that level
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   you know definitely
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   we'll see a little bit of a headwind
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   as we see a lot of these structural activities
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   that we're doing to come through precision
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   we also see a lot of tailwinds
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   I'm sorry we see tailwinds
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   a lot of these kind of structural costs come out
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   we see some of the headwinds
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   but you know as we kind of get closer
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   to coming out here to our budgets
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   and how we kind of work with the teams
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   we'll definitely find ways on how we can continue
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   to get that incremental margin
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   obviously to be at a minimum of that
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   days or more
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   Your next question comes from John Walsh
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   from Credit Suisse
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   Your line is open
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Your next question is from Markus Nittenmeyer
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   from UBS
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Your line is open
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   Hi good morning everybody
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   I'll just put one more on this
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Hi good morning
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   on synergies
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   I do appreciate that obviously procurement is
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   volume dependent
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   but you flag here 10 to 20 million savings
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   realized in 2020
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   what do you currently assume as sort of full run rate savings
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   out of that wave one of the spend
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   which I think is a third of your overall spend
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   and how should we think about more medium terms
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   for the other two thirds
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   if you assume that at some point
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   in a normalized way it gets back to about 2019 levels
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   let's start here
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   Yeah I think if you think about it
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   10 to 20
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   coming in this year
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   as you go into 2021
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   assuming maybe kind of current volume levels
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   it'll be 20 to 40 million
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   so that's maybe at least
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   that's what you can see here
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   coming from wave one
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   on an analyzed level at current volumes
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   and that all is only covering
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   a portion of the total spend
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   with wave two and wave three
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   coming up here in the second half of the year
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   Right and is there sort of an estimate
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   you can give us what that would have been
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   at 19 volume levels
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   20 to 40
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   I mean it would definitely be a little bit higher than that
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   I mean
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   I think at this point in time
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   you could say 40 to 50 could be
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   upwards of 16
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Okay and then
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   second question on capital allocation
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   you flagged in the slides
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   what's interesting is those bolt downs in PST
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   it's obviously pretty fragmented market
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   you probably have a share of
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   call it 15% in that space
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   and how do you think about this
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   how does that segment look like in a few years
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   from an aftermarket perspective
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   I know it's a design win and replacement business
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   so the aftermarket dollars per se
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   or share is relatively small
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   compared to company average
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   but how do you think about this
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   it just struck me that it was flagged
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   specifically in the slides
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   Yeah I think this is a segment
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   we like a lot by the way
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   that these businesses are
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   kind of so niche
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   and very solid
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   market positions
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   and it has just a lot of great
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   descriptors such as
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   high gross margins
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   and very specialized bumps
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   that are kind of really
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   solidly mission critical
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   in the processes where they
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   apply
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   we continue to see
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   there's a lot of potential not only in organic
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   but also organically
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   and we're doing a lot of work on that
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   whether you take technologies like
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   the ARO and combine that
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   with the
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   either Haskell branded product
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   or a Milton Roy product
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   and then you can actually create some uniqueness
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   in terms of applications
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   and then enter some new markets
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   and that's what a lot of the team are doing
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   you know how do we
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   are being thoughtful and mindful
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   on some of those vertical markets
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   and kind of new niche adjacent
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   that you want to play in
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   and not only do that organically
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   but then see what other technologies
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   from a Bolton perspective we can acquire
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   so a lot of really great work
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   strategically going on in this segment
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   to really picture this
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   and how do we kind of double it
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   thanks a lot good luck
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   thank you
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   your next question comes from John Walsh
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   from Credit Suisse
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   your line is open
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   hi good morning
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   sorry about that
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   had some technical difficulties earlier
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   I'm glad to hear everyone is doing well
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   maybe just one question here
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   you alluded on the call
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   to share gains on
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   kind of both the legacy GDI
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   and IR businesses
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   wanted to know if you could put a little more color
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   around what's driving those
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   is there something on the
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   the product side is it
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   some of the end market strategies
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   you were doing previously around
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   you know more niche markets
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   like paper and pulp
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   maybe some competitive
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   pressures from smaller
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   guys just any kind of color
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   you could divide there would be helpful
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   sure John yeah so
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   I'm not categorizing I mean what I said on the call
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   is that it is on specific horsepower
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   and what we saw
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   that we liked is that this is in the US
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   based on the third party report
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   and we liked because it was
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   very complimentary
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   so if you look at the legacy garnet damper
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   we saw some share takes in the low
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   to medium horsepower
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   while we saw on the Ingersoll ran some share take
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   on the high kind of larger
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   horsepower compressors
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   I will categorize that as Ingersoll ran has done
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   a pretty good job on launching some new technology
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   on the larger horsepower
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   well as you know from a garnet damper
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   perspective we have been more focused
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   on the medium to small compressor
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   and I think this is
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   what I mentioned on the call that this is a great hypothesis
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   that we had on this great
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   merge and combining the two companies
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   because now we have
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   great new complimentary products
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   and spectrum of technologies
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   that you know a lot of these
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   that I mentioned is on the oil lubricated
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   which is very good
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   solid kind of core product line
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   but as we spoke about during the
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   April call now also the
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   oil free product line spectrum
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   so again it's
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   it's new technology, new products
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   and be able to
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   show the uniqueness of differentiation
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   on the products that the teams are launching
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   great appreciate taking the question
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   thank you John
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   there are no further questions at this time
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   I turn the call back over to the company
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   thank you I just want to close out by saying
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   thanks to everyone for your interest
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   in Ingersoll ran
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   I want to do another shoot out
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   and thank you to our employees
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   that are always doing a lot of work here
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   to stay health
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   stay self-safety
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   and at the same time
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   provide to our customers the mission critical pros
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   that are needed
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   in this kind of current market conditions
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   so hopefully everyone stays safe
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   and healthy and we'll look forward
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   to talking to you over the next few weeks
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   thank you
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   thank you for participating
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.560]   disconnect.

[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Ryan Bentley, Director of Investor Relations.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Sir, please go ahead.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Thank you, Operator.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2020 earnings call.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   On the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Jean-Marc Germain, and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Math.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   After the presentation, we will have a Q&A session.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   A copy of the slide presentation for today's call is available on our website at constellion.com
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and today's call is being recorded.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Before we begin, I would like to encourage everyone to visit the company's website and take a look at our recent filings.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Such statements include statements regarding the company's anticipated financial and operating performance, future events and expectations,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and may involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   For a summary of specific risk factors that could cause results different material from those expressed in the forward-looking statement,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   please refer to the factors presented under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual report on Form 20F.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   All information in this presentation is as of the date of the presentation.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I would now like to hand the call over to Jean-Marc.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Thanks Ryan. Good morning, good afternoon everyone and thank you for your interest in Constellion.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Let's turn to slide 5.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   At Constellion, the health and safety of our employees is our first priority.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   We have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We have provided our personnel with personal protective equipment, increased cleaning and sanitation,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   allowed for and enforced social distancing and worked to raise awareness with our employees.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I want to personally thank our employees for taking this seriously and following the precautions we have put into place.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   As of last Friday, approximately one-half of 1% of our employees have tested positive for COVID-19 and all of them have recovered or are recovering.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Needless to say, we must remain vigilant.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   During the second quarter, our plans operated well despite the significant disruptions to customer demand from lockdowns in both Europe and the U.S.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   As I'm speaking, all our plans are running now and well.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   We are carefully monitoring COVID-19 hotspots both for the health of our employees and any potential impacts on supply chains.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   The demand for our products gradually increased during the course of the second quarter and this trend has continued into July.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   However, both levels of demand and visibility from our customers remain below historical levels.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   We took strong actions to combat the effects of the pandemic on our business.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   We aggressively reduced our costs, including flexing variable costs to match production levels, reducing fixed costs and lowering our targeted capital expenditures.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Over 40% of our workforce were on subtype of partial unemployment or temporary lay-of-scheme during the quarter.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Where appropriate, we have also implemented permanent headcount reduction.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Our ability to flex costs was slightly better than the scenario we provided last quarter.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   This was a great achievement by the entire Considium team and demonstrated our flexibility and resilience.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Our liquidity at the end of the quarter was 949 million euros, an increase of over 300 million euros compared to the end of the first quarter.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   We added an additional 50 million euros of liquidity in July through credit facilities supported by the German state,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   bringing our pro forma liquidity to approximately 1 billion euros.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   In June, we accessed the debt markets to refinance our 2021 bonds.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   This transaction removed our only near-term bond maturity at the very attractive coupon.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   In conclusion, with the significant actions we have taken, I am very confident in our ability to navigate through this crisis.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   On slide 6, you will see some of our highlights from the second quarter of 2020.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Shipments were 310,000 metric tons, a decrease of 25% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Revenue decreased 33% to 1 billion euros.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Of the roughly 500 million euro decline in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   2/3 was related to lower shipments and 1/3 was related to lower metal prices.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I remind you that while our revenues are affected by changes in metal prices,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   we operate a pass-through business model to minimize metal risk.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Net loss of 32 million euros compared to net income of 17 million euros in the second quarter of 2019.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Adjusted EBITDA of 81 million euros decreased 51% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   With a strong focus on cost control, we are able to offset a significant part of the volume EdWins
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   to Adjusted EBITDA across each of our business units.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I am proud of what the team was able to achieve in a challenging environment.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Custodium generated 228 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first half, a decline of 24% compared to the first six months of last year.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Our free cash flow was negative 33 million euros in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   This result would not have been possible without our strong actions to reduce costs and capital expenditures and cash expenditures of all sorts.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was 54 million euros.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Based on our current view of market conditions, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I will now hand over to Peter to discuss our financial performance in more detail.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Peter.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Thank you Jean-Marc and thank you everyone for joining the call today.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Turning now to slide 8, you will find the change in adjusted EBITDA by segment for the second quarter and the first half of 2020 compared to the same periods of last year.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   For the second quarter of 2020, Custodium achieved 81 million euros of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease of 86 million euros or 51% year over year.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   PARP adjusted EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased by 21 million euros or 27% compared to last year.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   ANT adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased by 33 million euros or 51% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   AS&I adjusted EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31 million euros compared to last year.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Lastly, holdings and corporate costs of 7 million euros were 1 million euros higher than last year.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   In the first six months of 2020, Custodium achieved 228 million euros of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease of 74 million euros or 24% year over year.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   PARP adjusted EBITDA of 124 million euros decreased by 14 million euros or 11% compared to last year.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   ANT adjusted EBITDA of 83 million euros decreased by 33 million euros or 28% compared to the first six months of 2019.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   AS&I adjusted EBITDA of 33 million euros decreased by 26 million euros or 44% compared to last year.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Lastly, holdings and corporate costs of 12 million euros were 1 million euros higher than last year.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   We expect agency costs of approximately 20 million euros in 2020.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Now, turn to slide nine and let's focus on the PARP segment.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   AS&I adjusted EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased 27% compared to the second quarter of last year.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Volume was a headwind of 41 million euros in the quarter.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Packaging shipments failed by 12% primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in March of our Newspersak plant in France due to COVID-19.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Shipments to the North American canned cheap market increased slightly year over year.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Automotive shipments declined 54% compared to last year as many of our automotive OEM customers curtailed production for April and most of May.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Price and mix was a headwind of 2 million euros.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Costs were a tailwind of 21 million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with labor and maintenance as important contributors.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Metal costs were neutral in the quarter as we faced difficult year over year comps, UBC supply chain challenges and lower metal prices.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   FX translation was a tailwind of 1 million euros.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Now turn to slide 10 and let's focus on the ANT segment.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased by 51% compared to last year.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Volume was a headwind of 46 million euros on lower aerospace and TID shipments.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Aerospace shipments fell 37% compared to last year as aerospace OEM and distributors began to reduce orders.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   TID shipments declined by 20% due to lower industrial activity in both Europe and the U.S.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Price and mix was a 3 million euro headwind due to lower aerospace shipments.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Costs were a tailwind of 15 million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with labor, metal and maintenance as important contributors.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Lastly FX translation was a 1 million euro tailwind in the quarter.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Now turn to slide 11 and let's focus on the AS&I segment.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   adjusted EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31 million euros compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Volume was a 31 million euro headwind.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Automotive shipments declined 52% compared to last year due to customer shutdowns for a significant portion of the quarter.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Industry shipments declined 16% due to lower industrial activity in Europe.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Price and mix was a 9 million euro headwind partially due to price and mix as a consequence of weaker market conditions.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Costs were a 9 million euro tailwind on strong cost control with labor, energy and fixed cost as important contributors.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Lastly FX translation was a 1 million euro headwind in the quarter.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Now turning to slide 12 I want to highlight our very strong cost performance during the second quarter.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   In the second quarter we managed to flex our cost by 83%.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Cost flex represents the change of cost over the change of revenues for the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Effectively for every dollar change in revenue we were able to flex our cost by 83 cents.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   This compares favorably to the 75% variable cost estimate we provided last quarter.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   At the bottom of the page you can see that each of our businesses demonstrated strong cost control with PARC at 92% cost flex and ANT and AS&I at 75%.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   To put this in context excluding metal and depreciation we reduced cost by approximately 100 million euros compared to the second quarter of last year.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   These cost savings were driven by strong cost control across the businesses including labor, maintenance, professional fees, subcontractors and energy.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I will note that our second quarter 2020 figures include approximately a 15 million euro benefit from European state employment aid related to COVID-19.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I want to congratulate the team for the aggressive actions taken on cost.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   We will continue to maintain our strong focus on cost control particularly given the uncertain demand environment.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Now let's turn to slide 13 and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   At the end of the second quarter our leverage was 4.4 times and our net debt was 2.2 billion euros slightly lower than our net debt position at the end of 2019.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   We remain very committed to capital discipline. We reduced our 2020 CAPEX target to approximately 175 million euros, a 96 million euro reduction from 2019.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Through the first half of 2020 we spent 32 million euros less in CAPEX than in the same period of last year.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Our free cash flow for the second quarter was negative 33 million euros.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   During the quarter as a consequence of lower activity our factored receivables were lower than the levels that we have maintained in recent quarters and negatively impacted our free cash flow by 73 million euros.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   We would expect the reverse to occur as activity levels increase.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Excluding the impact of factoring the company actually generated positive free cash flow in the second quarter which is a very impressive outcome in my view.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was 54 million euros. As John Mark noted earlier we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 based on our current view of market conditions.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Generating free cash flow is a firm priority and we remain committed to deleveraging.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   As you can see in our debt summary on the bottom left hand side of the page we have no bond maturities until 2024.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   During the quarter we refinanced the remaining 200 million of our 4 and 5/8 percent notes due 2021 with 325 million dollars of 5 and 5/8 percent notes due 2028.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   While we initially planned to repay the 21 with free cash flow we felt it was prudent to remove this near-term maturity given the favorable debt market conditions.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Notably this was the lowest coupon dollar bond that Constellium has ever priced a considerable achievement in the midst of a pandemic.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   As a result of our financing activities thus far in 2020 we now expect cash interest of 150 to 160 million euros.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was 949 million euros at the end of the second quarter.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   As John Mark noted we added 50 million euros to this balance in July and we remain very comfortable in our liquidity position.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I will now hand the call back to John Mark.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Thank you Peter. Let's turn to site 15. I want to highlight something that is core to our business sustainability.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   In early July we published our 2019 business and sustainability report which you can find on our website.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I'd like to point out a few highlights from 2019.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Safety is our first priority. Our target is to reduce our recordable case rates by 10 percent year after year.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Between 2016 and 2019 our recordable case rate decreased by 27 percent and we are trending very well this year.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   This means that more of our colleagues are returning home injury free every day.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   We also improved our energy efficiency by 6.4 percent compared to a 2015 baseline. That is the equivalent of a hundred thousand metric tons of CO2 savings every year.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Further we introduced the 2025 target to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 25 percent against the 2015 baseline
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   and we have a detailed plan to achieve this target.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   As many of you know recycling is a core competency at Constellium. Aluminum is infinitely recyclable with 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced still in use today.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Muscle Sholes is one of the largest recyclers of aluminum cans globally with a capacity to recycle over 20 billion cans every year.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   At NAFRIZAC we also recycle the equivalent of 12 billion beverage cans every year.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   As a company Constellium recycled over 560,000 metric tons of externally sourced aluminum scrap in 2019.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   I am also proud that third parties are recognizing Constellium for our sustainability achievements.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative or ASI is an industry led initiative to drive sustainability across the entire aluminum value chain from producers to customers.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   In 2019 we received ASI certifications for Zingen's casting and rolling operation and we began producing ASI certified coils for our customers from Zingen in 2020.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   We also received ASI certification of our NAFRIZAC facility under provisional COVID conditions in 2020.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   We achieved the EcoVadis Platinum rating which is awarded to the top 1 percent of companies assessed worldwide and we received an ESG rating of AA from MSCI placing us in the top 5 percent of our sector.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Overall we had a very successful year on our sustainability objectives in 2019 and I look forward to continuing our progress on these very important initiatives.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Now let's turn to slide 16 and discuss our end markets.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   We believe our balanced portfolio of products across end markets, geographies and customers is a competitive advantage during challenging times like these.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I'll start with the packaging market. Packaging is a core market for Constellium and represents 38 percent of our LTM revenue.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   We continue to see strong demand in North America and stable demand in Europe.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Further evidence that this market is both recession resilient and secular growth.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   We believe the packaging market has long term secular growth tailwinds driven by customer preference for aluminum cans.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Our customers continue to invest in new can lines with several additional investments in North America just announced in the last week.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   These additional lines should drive incremental demand for canned sheets in the years to come. The consumer preference trend is only one of the tailwinds for canned sheets.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   In Europe the demand for canned sheets continues to grow based on substitution of aluminum for steel.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   In the US we continue to expect the growth of auto body sheet demand to tighten supply to the packaging market over the medium to long term.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Now let's move to automotive.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Over the long term automotive remains a secular growth market for aluminum.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Customers continue to prefer larger vehicles.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   With regulations aimed at increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions the automotive market will need to continue to lightweight.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   In addition we expect hybrid and electric vehicles to continue to gain share of the fleet.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   These vehicles are aluminum intensive due to the importance of lightweighting to achieve their range objectives.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Constellium is well positioned to realize the benefits of this secular shift to aluminum in automotive and the electrification of the fleet.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Moving to more recent trends automotive OEMs began curtailing production in March and largely resumed production in May.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   While demand from our customers increased significantly in June we have experienced uneven demand for our products as a result of supply chain challenges and COVID 19 hotspots.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   While we are optimistic about automotive demand in the back half of 2020 the demand for our products will be dependent on the level of production at the OEM.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Let's turn now to aerospace. Aerospace represented 15% of our LTM revenues.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   The near term outlook for aerospace remains uncertain due to the effects from COVID 19 and the 737 max.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Aerospace OEMs have reduced build rates and it is unclear how long build rates will remain at these levels.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   We expect aerospace shipments in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 will be lower than the level in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   In TID we expect to continue to expand in each products in a diversified range of markets over the long term.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   In the near term the defense and rail markets remain strong but most industrial and transportation markets remain weak.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   These markets are dependent upon the health of the industrial economy in Europe and North America.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   It is unclear when and to what extent these markets will rebound.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   In closing I again want to thank the Constellium team for their tireless efforts during this trying time.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   We remain committed to operational execution, harvesting the benefits of our investments, disciplined capital deployment, debt reduction and shareholder value creation.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   With that Joanna we will now open the Q&A session.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Thank you sir.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press part and the number one on your touchtone telephone.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue please press the pound key.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Your first question comes from the line of Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Your line is open.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Chris if you are on mute please unmute.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Chris your line is open.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Hi John Mark and Peter can you hear me?
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Yes we can. Good morning Chris.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The first thing I wanted to start with was just the utilisation rates and the comments from one queue.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   You sort of stepped through how you saw utilisation in each of the divisions for two queue and then perhaps for three queue and four queue.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   You don't have guidance but I wondered whether you could maybe conceptually talk through three queue versus four queue and just versus two queue or any comments you could make on the divisions as an update from last quarter. Thanks.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Sure Chris so I'll start with the markets and then kind of translate it into what it can mean for the divisions right for the business unit.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   So when you look at our second quarter of this year versus the second quarter of last year right you see packaging roughly 10% down you see automotive 50% down you see aerospace 40% down right roughly.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And the other markets and each markets about 25% down. This is made of very different dynamics right so in packaging what we are seeing now is 95% utilisation.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   There was a bit of a drop especially in April with all the lockdowns in Europe reduction in canned consumption and all that but that has come back pretty strong and the US continues to be quite strong.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   So we look at packaging again recession resilient sector growth and we're pretty confident for the second half of the year and we look at queue two as being kind of an abnormal quarter because of all that happened in April and a little bit in May.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   If I look at automotive it has really snapped back you know I think when we talked on Q1 we're talking of 20% utilisation as we were speaking and now we're above 80% right.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   If you do the average of 20 and 80 you get to 50 which is about what we experienced in the second half into the reduction in their shipments. It seems like it can be stronger than 80% going forward.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   We really are running very well in July but we've seen that this restart has been with all kinds of fits and stops right. So you've got outspots, you've got supply chain disruptions, you've got difficulties in bringing products from Mexico, building trucks in Texas is challenging.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   So you've got all those operational issues that all of us in the supply chain have to deal with but clearly the demand seems to be well in excess of 80% of where we were last year so that's encouraging and hopefully COVID-19 doesn't throw too much of a wrench in that good thread.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   If I look now at aerospace where we're running at around 60% in the quarter we expect more pain in the second half of the year and I think the reason for that is it's a long supply chain and customers move a little bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their orders and that is creating a bit of a lag in terms of how much pain we take.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   We are in very detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion to look at what the second half ought to look like and whilst contractually we could force some volumes on us, that's not our type, what they don't need, we don't want to force on them.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   So what we're working through is taking more pain now in the second half so that 2021 we start with a clean slate so we would expect some reduction in operating rates in aerospace in the second half of the year.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   So if you translate all that into what it means for the different BU's, I would expect BOP packaging and automotive to be better, I would expect AS&I automotive structures essentially to be better in the second half and I would expect the NT to be more challenged in the second half.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Thanks so much.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Just sort of follow up on packaging specifically where the volumes are down at around about 10% I think year on year and you're saying muscle shovels is doing well, it seems like the US is going well.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I think Crown yesterday mentioned that Southern Europe was weak, can you just comment a little bit further about packaging in the EU region?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Was it down in the quarter because of demand or because you had facilities offline and maybe you could quantify some of the EU impacts?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   I think so the reason I'm saying more than 90% or 95% whatever, not 100% is exactly because of some weakness in Europe and I think it's got to do with both the reduction in activity in Southern Europe.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   A lot of these countries have economies that are based on tourism and this is not the best year for tourism as we all know.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   We are seeing little clusters and hotspots so everybody is vigilant as it should be so that is weighing down a little bit on canned consumption in Europe.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   A follow up on working capital specifically, I just wanted maybe Peter if you could talk through the two cue moving parts.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Obviously you stepped through those waterfall charts and you're getting cost out doing a great job on the cost side.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I just wanted if you comment a little bit further on the second half of the year and what the opportunities are on working capital in terms of you saying positive for the full year.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   You've already hit the positive number at the halfway point so just wanted if you could talk through the moving parts on working capital.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Sure, happy to do it and just for context so on the second quarter as we said last quarter we would use working capital and we in fact burned 63 million of working capital in the Q2 and for the first half were positive 24.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   So based on where we sit today I think it's plausible to think that with auto ramping, with packaging kind of continuing to ramp back up that we could lose some ground in the back half of the year.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   So not a huge negative but we could see working capital being a use in the back half of the year.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   But Chris I would say that we remain confident in spite of that that we we can achieve a free cash flow position.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Thanks.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Thanks for that.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   So that's it for me.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Good.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the benchmark company your line is open.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Good morning.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Good morning Josh.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Just a question.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   How are you thinking any tariffs on Canadian aluminum?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Have you increased any inventory expecting that or just what should we be thinking on that front if that comes to fruition?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Yeah. Well we believe it's misguided measure if it happens right. We've lobbied against it in the past. We've got it removed. It may come back. We think it's misguided and it doesn't address the problem which is over capacity from China from a non-market economy that doesn't play by the same rules as we do.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Now that said if it happens it's got a very limited impact on us. I remind you that we pass through the mail cost essentially to most of our customers.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   There may be a little section of the business where we cannot reprise immediately when it happens.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   But on the other side we may gain a little bit more on scrap recycling as well. So not much of an impact for us.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   The reason we're against it is much more a matter of principle because we believe in free and failed trade than really a problem for our finances or our economic outcome.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Got it.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And then just on the canned sheet front, can you remind us of when your larger contracts are up for renegotiation and then just comment around pricing strength?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   So we don't go into the detail of exactly which contracts mature when but you know that we've got a few renewals coming in around the 22 horizon.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   We are making good progress and I think the pricing environment is I would describe it as a mildly positive in the U.S. and mildly negative in Europe because of the specific situation now.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   I remind you that contractual negotiations take a lot of time here and whilst we, you know, I say it's mildly positive here and mildly negative there between now and whenever we actually ink a contract, things may change.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   But I think it's a pretty benign environment.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   And our product is in demand.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   I'll brag a little bit.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Our quality and our service is very much recognized.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Mr. Scholz has done a terrific job in over the past five years and he's a very strong player in the market now, very recognized, the quality service wise.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And then for Isaac has always been.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   So we have strong positions and I'm looking at the future with a great deal of confidence.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Great.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Thanks, Josh.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   The next question comes from the line of David Dragliano from BMO Capital Markets.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Your line is open.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Great.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Thanks for taking my questions.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   First of all, I did have one question on the numbers for the second quarter.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Did you say there was a $15 million one-time benefit included in the $81 million adjusted EBIT dial line?
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   You're talking about for the labor benefit?
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I thought it was a COVID-19 state aid benefit.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Yeah, I think included in adjusted EBIT dial.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   But it's not a one-off and it continues.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Those programs are what is referred to as a goods outbites or short time work and these government programs continue through 2020 and in some cases in 2021.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Okay.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   So we should assume about a $15 million quarterly benefit from those programs each quarter?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Well, yeah, no, because what will happen, David, is remember, so in the second quarter we had a lot of people on the sidelines, right?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   But as we ramp up, then we're going to have substantially less of that.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   So I think you should assume that in the businesses, you know, so packaging, for example, where we had some benefit in Q2, we should have, you know, basically very limited if any benefit in Q3.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   And, you know, automotive, which is fade away and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating innovation right there, but it'll be a much lower number.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   To give you an indication, we mentioned about people being unemployed during the quarter.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   At the trough, which is behind us, we had 6,000 people under some kind of unemployment benefit or temporary layoff.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Now we're at less than 2,000.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   So it's closed dramatically.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And David, just to put it in perspective, if you get to the fourth quarter, the number might be something like 25% of that, right?
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Just based on the utilization rate, just rough number.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Okay.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   That's actually helpful.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Thank you.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Just in terms of the, you know, the individual and market commentary, on the aerospace side, obviously that's the -- or has been, you know, the highest margin business.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   And, you know, just in terms of the outlet commentary, you framed obviously two segments up, one segment down, but, you know, the down segment is, again, the highest margin segment.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I didn't really get a census to order of magnitude of the down number versus the up numbers.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Can you just give us a census to, you know, do you believe that aerospace will completely offset the recovery and auto and packaging in the second half or a bit more, you know, color on magnitude -- order of magnitude on the decline in aerospace would be helpful.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Yeah, so it's very difficult to tell, David, because we're, as we speak, in very active discussions with our customers and at the end of the day, it's so cool that we have to make jointly with them.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   As I mentioned, we've got contracts whereby we can force them to take some products, which they will take and pay for, but then they don't need it the following year, right?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   They hold the inventory; they are holding the back. So we are looking collaboratively with them in terms of what is it exactly they need, which, by the way, I don't think they fully know now and it's no criticism of them.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   I mean, it's very unusual time. And once we know what they need and we look at what cuts do we take, then I could answer your question possibly.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   At this stage, I cannot. I would just say that there will be for sure more pain in auto structures and then in auto structures, in aerospace, my apologies, aerospace.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Now, the other thing too is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period in the recent past, the second half is always weaker than the first half, right, in aerospace.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   So that's something to factor in as well.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Okay. And just my last related question is, I think you mentioned, I think average utilization rates for aerospace related demand in the second quarter was around 60 percent at your facilities.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Is that right? What is that number now?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   We're running still around that number, but I would expect it to go down maybe to 50 percent that kind of range.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Okay. All right, that's helpful. Thanks very much.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Okay. Yeah, so it's very important to say we're not expecting it to go down to 30 percent right there. That's not on the horizon.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Speaker, your next question comes from the line of Kurt Woodward from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Yeah, hi. Good morning.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Peter, first question on the hundred million year of cost reductions. How much of that would you view as structural and then, you know, I guess just in general in terms of the amount of cost you think you could take out of the business this year on a permanent basis?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Can you give us an update on those efforts?
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   So if we look at the -- I mean, so the biggest piece of that hundred million is related to labor, right?
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   So -- and that's probably -- labor is probably, you know, half of that hundred million.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   So what we're doing now is we are really closely looking at the business and, you know, what it's likely to be like for the next couple years and then, you know, trying to size our labor forces according to that.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   So in that regard, I think we would expect that there's going to be some kind of permanent savings.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   But remember, as we kind of ramp up the operations, we do expect some of that cost is going to come back, right?
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   So, you know, I'd say it's hard to give a really precise number on that, Kurt. It's a difficult one.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Kurt, if I may add, we have talked about Horizon 22, right, and one of the strategic initiatives was to look at how do we lean our organization without losing competencies, capabilities,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   but how do we lean and make the organization stronger? And I think what COVID-19 is doing to us and I guess to many other companies out there is accelerate the number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   So along the lines that Peter was saying, I think we'll come out of this with some permanent cost reductions and as we ramp up, we will not ramp up and inject back 100 million of cost.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   How much, you know, will remain to be seen because we're really learning as we're doing and we're just in the middle of it now, but we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And there's certain categories like, for example, professional fees, subcontractors, where, you know, kind of as we work without fees, because those are, you know, kind of big categories of reduction,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   I think we were able to kind of live without a lot of that going forward. So, yeah, I think there's definitely a piece about that we can carry forward.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   There's certain examples that are not trivial. They're quite revealing, right? So we've got a very strong, you know, R&D and technical support organization,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   which is, you know, people that are centrally located and go and help plants. And historically, a lot of the work was done by people going to the location.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Now, obviously, in the past three months, nobody's been able to travel anywhere. And a lot of that has been done through remote interaction, video conference,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   but even when you go to a plant and you look at, I got a problem and I need to improve the speed on this mill,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   we've had people, you know, interacting by the mill tool bit on a FaceTime and going into, looking into the rolling mills by FaceTime with a technical advisor
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   on the other side of the planet and that works actually fine, which we wouldn't have thought it would be possible.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   So, in the future, what you're gaining here is, well, you're saving travel time, which is not very good for the aerospace business,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   but also you're saying the cost, you're saving the time, which means that people can be on several interventions,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   while historically within a week, you know, it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   So I think we're going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our, you know, space that are going to be quite interesting in the future
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   and I think it's going to help us inject more brain and talent remotely with more practice.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And Kurt, you know, as we go forward, we may be able to give you more color on this,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   but, you know, hopefully it comes across that we're really looking hard at taking structural costs out
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   and in the short term, the objective is we want to be, you know, kind of free cash flow positive through this crisis
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   and so that we don't take on any incremental debt, ideally, and in the longer term,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   we want to emerge with a, you know, kind of much stronger earnings power.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   So we're focused on exactly that and, you know, we'll have more to say as we progress.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Okay, now that's helpful.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   And then, you know, in terms of the free cash flow, you know, dynamics,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   you mentioned I think it's $73 million impact from backfiring this quarter, otherwise you'd be free cash flow positive,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   which is pretty positive given your utilization rate and now you're talking about 95% utilization
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   and packaging over 80% and auto, and it seems like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   So, you know, 75% of your business could be close to 90% utilization in a couple of months.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   I get that arrow is weaker.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   But it would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint, you know,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   unless working capital would be a major negative, you should be generating decent free cash in the back half of the year.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Can you comment at all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year?
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   So we won't put a specific number on it, but we're confident that we will generate free cash flow for the full year.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   And, you know, the back half of the year, I think there's a very good chance that we can generate some free cash flow,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   but it depends a lot on what happens with trade working capital.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   As I said, we've got, you know, the ramp of these businesses.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   So we want to be a little cautious until we see the pace of the ramp and the consequences of the ramp.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   But again, for the full year, we remain confident that we can generate free cash flow.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Okay. And then just final question on arrow.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Just final question on mark. You had a comment on, I guess, working with the OEMs to create, you said a clean slate entering 2021.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   So, you know, is that statement kind of reflecting the fact that the OEMs cut very quickly,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   and I assume they're sort of an excess inventory issue that they're dealing with or in general on the supply chain.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Those items would be below the actual bill to rate to help them clear inventory.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   So then when you get into 2021, you know, the supply chain is in a pretty good position.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   And, you know, contractually, you said you're not going to force it on them.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   But then, you know, if you're going to help them manage that, do they -- do you get anything in return,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   i.e., you know, price benefit or, you know, is this just kind of everyone helping each other?
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Just a little bit of an understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate comment.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Well, yeah, no fair question.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   So I think I've commented in the past on the fact that I thought that the shipments we're making
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   into the OEMs right into the supply chain were actually higher than what the bill rates were warranting at the time.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   And obviously the bill rates are going down very significantly down.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   Now, so the pain we're going to take in the second half I think is not going to cure all the, you know,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   inventory buildup in the supply chain, first of all.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   But I think what that does is it positions us for 2021 that doesn't show further deterioration.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   That's what we're into, right?
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   And we want to be in a place where what we supply is by and large consistent with what is being built, right?
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   So that's what we're trying to do, whether we get there fully, I don't know,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   but certainly we are aiming to be better in 2021 than what the 9 months of, you know, post COVID will be in ANP.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   That's one of the goals.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   In terms of what we're getting from the OEMs, we've got very strong deep strategic relationships with them.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   I've commented also in the past on the fact that we're in it for the long haul.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   And I think it's evidenced by the tenure contract we signed with Airbus.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   I mean, tenure is a long duration, never happened before.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   And we did it because it was the right thing to do for both companies, for both businesses.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   And we didn't do it as a reaction to COVID or whatever, right?
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   I mean, that was really the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   So we're looking past the current crisis.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   The current crisis, we've got to get all in the same boat or in the same aircraft and put us in the same place,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   work together to overcome the crisis.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   And we are not talking about, you know, if I do that, you give me a bit more price or whatever.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   I think it's just a relationship where we want to be in the win-win partnership
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   and we do some things that help them and they'll do some things that help us in the future,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   which I've already done in the past and that's already happened and that's continuing.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Okay, great. Thank you very much.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields from Bank of America.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Your line is open.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   Hey, Peter. One on the markets and then one on the balance sheet, please.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   So, you know, saw that canned volumes were down about 11 percent,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   but, you know, Norse reported canned volumes up 11 percent.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   I think you guys face relatively the same markets in Europe.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Can you sort of point to why maybe they're having more success on their canned volumes?
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Was it enough for stock being down issue or a market issue or what?
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Can you just explain that discrepancy for us, please?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   It's mainly, I believe -- I mean, I cannot comment on their specific situation,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   but in our case the main reason was that we had to take down Netflix Act for a full week
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   and then ramp it up gradually.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   I remind you that Netflix Act was at the center of a hotspot,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   the first real hotspot in France and there was very terrible conditions for the second half of March.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   So, in March we continued to ship out of Finnish goods,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   but then we had to replenish the Finnish goods
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   and that really took down our shipments in the second quarter.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   But we're back to normal now.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   Okay, thanks. That's sort of what I expected.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   And on the balance sheet, it looks like you got a decent amount of funding from France
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   and obviously Switzerland and Germany.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   You said it was partially guaranteed, but it's also secured.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Can you just give us a better understanding of sort of what it's secured by?
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Is it inventory or is it sort of PPE?
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And then to what extent is it guaranteed by the French government?
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Well, it depends on the facility, but the big one, the French one, is secured on PPE and E.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   And in the case of the German ones, one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   and the Swiss one is unsecured.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   And the guarantees, the way they work is they guarantee a certain percentage of the principal.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   So it's a normal syndicata banks with, in the case of France, I think the guarantee is for 70% of the --
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   sorry, 80% in the case of France of the principal balance is guaranteed by the French state.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   In the case of Germany, I think it's 80% too.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   So just for our purposes as credit analysts, 80% of that French loan is sort of non-recourse to you?
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Well, again, it is recourse to us.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   What I think the point is is that if you're a lender, so for example, if you're in the syndicata banks
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   and you are lending say 50%, your responsibility is for 10 -- oh sorry, 50%, 50 million.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Your responsibility is for 10 of that.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   Right, so it's the banks that benefit from the guarantee, not the company.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Okay, so you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks?
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   But one thing -- I'm sorry.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   The government isn't backstopping the loan for you, it's backstopping the loan for the banks.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   One thing to kind of -- I think is a really important point is our intent in putting this liquidity on the balance sheet
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   was to remove any question about the fact that we have enough liquidity.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   As we said from the beginning and based on the performance in the second quarter, we do not anticipate using this.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   So the French facility we had to draw, just by the terms of the agreement, but it just sits on our balance sheet as cash.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   And the German facility that we've now signed up in July, we don't expect to draw that.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   The delay draw term loan, we haven't drawn that.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   And the Swiss facility, we don't have that drawn in most instances.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   And the way we benefit from the state guarantee is through very cheap interest rates.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   That's cheap money and that was important to us.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   We don't think we need the money, so we're not going to pay a lot of interest for it.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   That ended obviously with an inducement for the banks to lend, right?
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Now, fair enough.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   You know, I think the French facility is what, two and a half percent effectively at this point?
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Yeah, that's the code.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   All right, so you don't really have an incentive to pay that off quickly, you know,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   given your bonds or kind of twice that, right?
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   No, no, that's right.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   Now, remember there are some limitations on the use of the capital, right?
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   So for example, we can't use that capital to go and buy back bonds in the market.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   So it's really meant to be for, you know, kind of operating needs of the company.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   We don't have a strong incentive to repay that.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   But what we will do is, you know, obviously there's some cost to it, right?
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   So as we kind of emerge from the crisis and have a little more visibility,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   then we'll unwind those facilities.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   Okay, that's very helpful.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   Thanks for all the color and good luck in the back half.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Thank you.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Thank you.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wundruck from Deutsche Bank.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Your line is open.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   And really great job on transparency and costs here.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   Both very helpful.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Thanks, Sean.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Just when you think about big picture, if you look at the auto market,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   there's sort of projections out in the market that we'll have about 25% decline in new cars this year,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   mostly based on the fact that we weren't producing back in March/April.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   And if you look at the used auto market, you know, it's been pretty strong as of late.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   We've used prices really rising even above last year.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   You know, you talk about how production's been increasing and demand is increasing there.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   You know, to kind of get to down 25%, you know, you'd have to have some pretty strong growth in 3Q and 3/4.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   So I guess what I'm asking is, do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon,
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   you know, with demand pulling through based on a lack of cars?
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   And if you can provide a little color where you're seeing there, that'd be very helpful.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   Yeah, so, I mean, the auto book is strong, there's no question, it's above the 80% that I'm mentioning, right?
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   But we've been a little bit caught, you know, by customers just a few months ago telling us,
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   we need product tomorrow and then telling us the next day the plant is shut down, right?
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   So, you know, we are very vigilant, right?
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   So I hope, I think the end demand is there, I think, and that's true in the US, that's true in Europe, right?
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   The governments have injected a lot of money in the hands of consumers, right?
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   Through the unemployment benefits of, you know, different shapes and forms that you see on both continents.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   And that is, you know, pretty good for end demand at the end of the day.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   So I hope it's going to be, it's going to materialize into the order book we have,
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   it's going to be actually real orders and shipments, in which case it should be better.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   But, you know, we've seen fits and starts, you see plants restarting and then shutting down
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   because there's COVID infections or you see people having trouble staffing, you know,
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   shifts because there's too many cases in the hotspot.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   So it's still fragile. I mean, it looks quite good, but it's still fragile.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   Right. That's helpful. Thank you, John Margin.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   I guess that's a good lead into the next question.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   So when you think about your customers, you know, we've had some shutdowns.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   We've had things come back online.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Do you feel that your customers and their CEOs are getting more confidence in their ability
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   to stay online or getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curve there?
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   Yeah, I would think so.
[00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   I think all of us have made tremendous efforts to provide the proper environment for our employees.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   It's very interesting. I was commenting on the, you know, half of percent of our employees have been affected by COVID confirmed.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   We have had no new case, confirmed case in Europe since the middle of May.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   So I think this is saying something about the fact that when people take responsibility in their daily lives, right,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   because it goes beyond what they do within our factories
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   or during the eight hours or 10 hours, whatever they work with us, you can have an impact.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   And I think, you know, if people wear masks when they interact with the outside,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   with people they come across, I think it makes a tremendous difference.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   So I hope the reality will slowly or more than slowly settle in and good practices will get that virus away from us sooner rather than later.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   And I think people are seeing the confidence building up.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   I mean, it's human nature. You need to be affected to take steps.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   And I think we're in the process where in many places people are still being affected before they take steps.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   But if you look at China, and China is, you know, going extremely strong, you know,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   it's a small operation for us, but we are above budget, above last year, right?
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   You look at Europe, new cases are really on a downward trend,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   even though there's some clusters here and there, and we'll see a stronger rebound.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   And I hope this is coming to us in the U.S. through the U.S.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   It's great. It's good to hear John Mark and I hope everybody is safe and well over there.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   Thank you very much and good luck.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   Thank you.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   Go ahead sir.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   Go ahead Joanna.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   Yes sir, I am showing no further questions at this time.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. John Marcher-Main, CEO of Constellium. Go ahead.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   Thank you Joanna. So thanks everyone for participating in the call today.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   As you can see we are very focused on facing the crisis, protecting cash flow,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   and building a stronger Constellium when things are behind us.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Thank you very much and look forward to updating you on our progress in Q3. Take care. Stay well.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   Thank you speakers, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.520]   Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Yes, Dan and welcome to the next our Media Group Second Quarter 2020 Results Call.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Today's call is being recorded.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Giafani and Vessa Relations.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Please go ahead, sir.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Thank you, Anna and welcome everyone.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I just want to read the safe harbor language after which we'll get to the actual presentation.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   All statements and comments made by management during this conference call,

[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   that may cause actual results to differ maturely from those reflected by the forward looking statements made during the call.

[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   With that, it's now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to your host,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   next our Chairman, President and CEO, Perry Perry, please go ahead.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Thank you Joseph and good morning everyone.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Thank you all for joining us to review Next Star's record second quarter results today.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   As we get started, I want to acknowledge the Next Star Nation team members
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   on our frontline essential work and tireless efforts to provide viewers and users
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   with continuous access to local news and other services,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   despite the challenges presented by the pandemic and recent civil unrest.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   With our planning and preparation, strong balance sheet and commitment to our markets and employees,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I'm proud to say that Next Star has kept our employee roster intact
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   and our record quarterly results again reflect our team's commitment to flexibility throughout this time.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   As always, our Chief Financial Officer Tom Carter is on the call with me this morning.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Next Star's industry leading scale and diversification are solid executions
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   such as our new business strategies and our rapid adoption of cost containment programs
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   at the onset of the pandemic resulted in record second quarter results
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   with all of our cash flow metrics well above consensus expectations.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   The 41% rise in second quarter net revenue reflects growth
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   in total television advertising revenue as we grow year over year increases
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   in the same space and new television business and strong shares of political spending in our markets
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as the 71% year over year increase in distribution fee revenues.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   As such, despite the economic pressures related to the pandemic,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Next Star's top line growth and operating and expense management disciplines
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   resulted in a 38.7 increase in net income and record second quarter
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   broadcast cash flow adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   with those net metrics growing 28%, 49% and 127% respectively on a year over year basis.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   As the world continues to address the health and economic challenges brought on by the pandemic,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   the strengths of our business model and enterprise-wide focus on managing operations for free cash flow
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   enabled us to bring about 21% of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   In the year-to-date period, Next Star has generated approximately $631 million
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   of free cash flow before one-time transaction expenses.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   By way of comparison, we generated a total of $521 million of free cash flow in all of 2019
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   so our growth momentum remains strong even before the upcoming benefit
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   of political spending in the back half of the year.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Reflecting repurchases made in Q1 we have reduced our share count
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   to approximately 45.5 million shares outstanding.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So 2020 year-to-date free cash flow per share amounts to about $13.86 per share
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and we remain confident in our unique positioning in this environment
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   to again generate significant free cash flow in the current quarter and again in Q4 of this year.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Speaking of the full year 2020, it's important to remember that approximately 60% of our annual revenue
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   is expected to be derived from contractual distribution fee and political advertising revenue
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   which is not expected to be materially impacted by the pandemic.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Specifically, Next Star has solid visibility in terms of our contractual distribution economics
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   through December of 2022 as we completed new multi-year retent submission consent agreements
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   representing approximately 70% of our subscribers at year-end 2019
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   as well as new long-term network affiliation contracts with CBS, Fox and NBC.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   At the same time Next Star has a strong balance sheet
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   including approximately $665 million in cash as of June 30
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   with an access to another $140 million under our Revolving Credit Facility.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   We continually successfully navigate through the evolving challenges presented by the pandemic
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   based on our core value of serving communities where we operate by delivering leading local news
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and other critical information and content to viewers whether on air or online.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   In this regard, Next Star stations have produced 41 separate town hall meetings
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   addressing state and regional responses to the virus.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Additionally, Next Star has generated over 30 different programs
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   related to recent civil unrest and race relations in our communities.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   With local news and information, while it's never been more essential for Americans
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   the pandemic has changed consumers' media consumption habits
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   in ways that showcase the inherent strength of local broadcast television,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   our content and Next Star's leading local brands.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   As the most powerful and trusted voice in the country,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   more people are turning into their stations local newscasts than ever before.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   According to Nielsen data, even as states and localities began to reopen in the second quarter
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   local broadcast television evening news viewership among adults aged 18 to 34
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   remained impressively high with year-over-year increases
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   and average cumulative weekly impressions in April, May and June
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   of 151%, 83%, and 89%, respectively.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Similarly, on the Digital Front, Next Star's web sites and mobile apps
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   grew year-over-year page views by 250% to 1.1 billion in April
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   with total monthly users up 133% to 96 million.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   We continue to generate strong digital audiences throughout the quarter
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   with weekday and weekend page view traffic across our local web sites
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   up 50% and 60% respectively during the months of June compared to the prior year.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Additionally, in terms of unique users, Next Star's digital properties
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   ranked number one in the country in local news, number 12 in all of news and information
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   and with the number 33 site overall domestically in June as measured by ComScore.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   As the nation's largest producer of local news programming,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Next Star's proprietary content provides essential news and information to users
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and viewers that is unique and relevant to each of the local communities we serve
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   across the United States.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Now more than ever, viewers rely on television news to stay informed about everything
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   from the latest pandemic developments to reopening of the economy to the upcoming election
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   with Next Star's market leading stations and sites, deep local and national reach
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   and local broadcast record of being the most influential and effective medium
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   for both brands and politicians.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   We expect to see advertisers continuing to allocate increased spending
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   to our broadcast and digital platforms as this results.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Turning back to some second quarter highlights,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   total television advertising revenue increased 18.1% to 319.8 million
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   including political revenue of 21.6 million and core advertising revenue of 298.2 million.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   While local and national advertisers adapted their media plans during the second quarter,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   we saw sequential month over month improvement in our same station core advertising revenue performance
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   from April to May, from May to June and this trend continuing in July.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Notwithstanding marketplace challenges, Next Star's local sales initiatives
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   continue to generate healthy levels of new business with second quarter new to television
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   and revenue rising on both a quarterly sequential and year over year basis.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   In total, our sales team generated $20.7 million of second quarter new to television revenue
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   marking 11.3% rise over the first quarter and a 4.5% rise over the comparable 2019 period.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   As I mentioned at the outset of our call, our new business strategies,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   ongoing sales training, education and deployment of performance-focused initiatives
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   combined with our sharing of best practices have proven very effective
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   in our ability to capture ad spend and share in both broadcast and digital locally.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   We recorded healthy levels of Q2 spending by political action committees
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and from candidates with 20/22nd quarter political revenue of 21.6 million
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   exceeding our expectations from early in the quarter despite the cancellation of some primaries.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Both presidential campaigns recently generated record levels of fundraising
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   which bodes well for our upcoming political revenues trajectory
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   as such our full year 2020 expectation for net political revenue
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and the low $400 million range remains unchanged.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Recent distribution agreement renewals and the inclusion of WGN America
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   resulted in a 71% rise in second quarter distribution revenue
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   of 536.5 million representing nearly 59% of total net revenue.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Second quarter 2020 total digital revenue declined by approximately $9.6 million
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   or 17% reflecting our focus on higher margin profitable operations
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   while digital profitability was up substantially over the comparable prior year period
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   as our website and mobile app engagement also rose significantly.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Total combined second quarter digital and distribution fee revenue of $583.2 million
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   rose approximately 57.1% over the prior year period
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and rise 64% of quarterly revenues up from 57% in the year ago period.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   The year over year increase in second quarter distribution revenue
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   reflects the new agreements reached in the second half of 2019
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   and our realization of Trudion Media revenue synergies related to the after acquired clauses
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   in our retransmission consent contract and as noted the inclusion of WGN America.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Our expectations for net retrans growth remain unchanged for the balance of the year
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   in the mid-teens percentage range reflecting new long term network affiliation agreements
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   with CVS Fox and NBC completed in the second half of 2019
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and as a result over 80% of our big four affiliations are contracted
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   through December 31 of 2021 and over 70% of our big four affiliations
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   are contracted through December 31 of 2022.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   With our successful 2019 renewal of retransmission consent agreements
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   representing approximately 70% of our subscriber base
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   with approximately 17% of the base to be renewed this year
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   our significant net retrans revenue growth in 2020
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   will complement the strong political growth and spending that we're seeing
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   taking together the affiliation renewals which also include OTT agreements
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   our new retrans contracts and sub levels that remain in line with our forecast
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   we have pretty clear visibility for our net retrans revenue growth expectations
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   in 2020 and beyond.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   As we discussed on the last call at the onset of the pandemic
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   we took immediate action to adapt our business to address the economic impact
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   on the US commercial advertising market.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   We implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   in excess of $40 million from budgeted second quarter levels.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Looking at the third quarter while the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   we're seeing the same pattern of month over month improvement in our pacing data
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   and expect to benefit from significantly increased levels of political ad spending
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and in fact our July political billing exceeded that of all of Q2.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Overall we're encouraged by continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   and by key economic indicators including employment data and consumer spending
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and at present we're cautiously optimistic about the return of live sports
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   as live news and sports programming continues to generate the strongest levels
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   of viewership across our all demographics.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Additionally preparations for the September 1 launch of WGN America's
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Prime Time National Newcast News Nation
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   which will reach approximately 75 million households across the country
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   are proceeding on schedule and on budget.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   We're in rehearsals now and my first impressions of the product are very positive.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   News Nation will air daily from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and will draw on the local regional and national expertise of next cars
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   5,400 journalists and 110 local newsrooms across the country
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   and during the quarter we announced the anchor teams and correspondents
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   for our live three hour prime time national newscast
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   we're already attracting strong interest from leading national advertisers
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   at much higher than normal cost per points for WGN America.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Our guests will deliver news reporting that is fact based, impactful and unbiased
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and we're confident that there are more Americans than ever before who were seeking just that.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   In addition to the live nightly newscast, News Nation's team of reporters and producers
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   will deliver news 24 hours a day online through News Nation's soon to be launched app
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   News Nation Now which will create another opportunity for monetization
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   and revenue diversification.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   As always we remain committed through generating free cash flow
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   actively manage our capital structure, our cost of capital and our liquidity position
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   to provide the financial flexibility to support our business and enhance shareholder returns
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   as we emerge from the pandemic.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   During the first half of 2020 we allocated approximately $594 million in cash from operations
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and investments toward debt reduction, opportunistic share repurchases and cash dividends.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Distantly, as I mentioned before, NEXTAR continues to maintain a strong balance sheet
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   including $665 million cash on hand at June 30
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   with access to additional $140 million under our Revolving Credit Facility.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   On the return of capital front in late June we declared our third quarterly cash dividend
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   at the new $0.56 per share level which was 24% ahead of last year's payout.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   With our 191% year to date free cash flow growth, our contractual distribution fee revenues
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   our food network distribution our historically low LIBOR rates
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   which have reduced our interest expense
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and what is projected to be the biggest presidential election cycle in the company's history
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   we remain confident in our positioning to be free cash flow positive in every quarter of 2020
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   and we continue to expect NEXTAR's net leverage to decline to approximately four times by year end.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   In summary, while the pandemic has presented challenges for most every industry
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   NEXTAR's leading local platforms are well positioned to continue building the top line
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   maintaining close control of fixed and variable cost and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Over time, our disciplines in these areas have strengthened the resiliency of our business
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   and our business model and created an unrivaled local marketing platform
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   while supporting increasing and growing returns for our shareholders.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   With that said, let me turn the call over to Tom Carter for our financial review and update. Tom?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Thanks Perry and good morning everybody.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   As outlined in this morning's press release the actual results
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 reflect the company's legacy NEXTAR operations
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   and results from Tribune media stations which were acquired on September 19, 2019.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Second quarter 2020 revenue from WG and America also acquired in the Tribune transaction
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   is included in core television advertising revenue and distribution fee revenue.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Contribution from NEXTAR's 31.3% ownership stake in television food network
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   and other investments acquired in the Tribune transaction
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   is included in the full income statement under income or loss on equity investments net
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   and in the cash flow statement under distributions from equity investments.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   The comparable three and six month period ended June 30, 2019 reflects legacy NEXTAR operations during that period.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   All actual results also reflect the impact of one-time transaction expenses
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   incurred in the quarters both in the quarters and the six month period ending June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   With that with a review of NEXTAR's Q2 income statement and balance sheet data
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   after which I'll provide an update on our capital structure and some points of guidance.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   On a combined company basis and pro forma for the invested station, second quarter same station net total revenue
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   was down 6% due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately 35%,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   reflecting a sharp decline in April due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month improvement
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   from April to May from May to June.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Same station distribution fee revenue was up 28%
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   and continuing digital revenues were down 18.2% reflecting local agency services revenue growth
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   of approximately 8% while station website revenue was down approximately 30%
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   due to software local customer buying trends related to the pandemic.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   To offset the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on commercial advertising revenue
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   late in the first quarter NEXTAR implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings in excess of $40 million from budgeted levels
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Second quarter station direct operating expenses net of trade expense were approximately $414 million
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   up from $292 million in the prior year primarily reflecting the full quarter of incremental expenses
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   associated with the Tribune operations and the budgeted growth in network affiliation expense
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   as a partial offset to our rising distribution revenue.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Second quarter station SG&A was approximately $158 million inclusive of the Tribune operations.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Same station pro forma fixed expenses excluding programming expenses were down 18%
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   over year-over-year period due to synergies related from the Tribune acquisition and the previously mentioned
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   expense reduction activities in response to the pandemic.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Corporate expenses were $35 million inclusive of $13 million of stock-based comp
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   and approximately $5.4 million of one-time transaction expenses.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   When excluding non-cash comp and one-time transaction expenses recurring corporate expenses
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   were approximately $17 million which came in better than the guidance we had provided
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   in the first quarter call of approximately $21.5 million.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   By the end of April, the vast majority of the initial operating synergies of the Tribune transaction
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   have been realized.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Second quarter operating cash taxes were approximately $6 million substantially lower
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   than our guidance of $45 million to $50 million due to a timing difference.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   That $40 to $45 million variance will now be paid in Q3.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Ongoing CAPEX and transaction CAPEX totaled $40 million.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Spectrum repacked CAPEX totaled $13 million and received approximately $26 million of reimbursement
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   from the FCC during the quarter.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   As a reminder we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all spectrum related CAPEX over the course of the year.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Second quarter total interest expense amounted to $82 million up from $51 million in the same period in 2019
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   while cash interest expense was $78 million compared to $49 million last year
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   with increases due to obviously the increased debt associated with the Tribune funding
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   partially offset by lower interest rates.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Second quarter broadcast cash flow of $291 million
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   as well as adjusted EBITDA 298 million and free cash flow of $200 million all pre-transaction expenses
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   exceeded consensus expectations and primarily reflect the realization of synergies
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and growth related to the Tribune transaction.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Distribution agreement renewals executed in the second half of the year
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   ended at third tax cash taxes as I mentioned before.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow reflect approximately $27 million in distributions
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   from equity investments related to our 31% ownership in the TV Food Network.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   As a reminder we received cash distributions from TV Food on a quarterly basis
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   with the largest payment recorded during the first quarter of each year.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   For the third quarter of 2020 we anticipate recording approximately $12 million in TV Food Network distributions.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   We expect cost savings in Q3 to approximate $25 million
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   relative to the originally budgeted levels
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   as variable cost and discretionary expenditures are prudently brought back online
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   with the expected strengthening of the economy and the broadcasting advertising environment.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   For the third quarter we project recurring cash corporate overhead exclusive of stock comp
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and transactions cost to be approximately $23 million
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   and we will easily meet our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   for approximately $120 million for the entire year.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Non-cash comp is projected to be approximately $13 million for the quarter
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   and $48 million for the full year.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Transaction expenses will approximate $3 million for the quarter
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and will decline for the remainder part of the year.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   For the third quarter operating cash taxes are now estimated to be approximately $150 million
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and operating cash taxes for the entire year will now come in at approximately $250 million in total.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Non-operating cash taxes associated with the gains on the asset sales
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   and legal sentiments in Q3 will be approximately $83 million.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Third quarter CAPEX should come in at approximately $40 million
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and we're still expecting approximately $160 million for the entire year.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   We're proceeding on budget with our investment related to the launch
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   of WGN America's Primetime National Newscast News Nation on September 1
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and prioritized capital expenditures to maintain maximum flexibility
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   in the current environment meaning the timing of certain CAPEX can be delayed
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   until later quarters if required.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Finally we expect Nextar's cash interest expense to approximately $78 million for the third quarter
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   and $325 million for the full year reflecting interest expense savings
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   related to the decline in LIBOR rates.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Turning to the balance sheet, Nextar's outstanding debt at June 30 was approximately $8 billion
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   and consisted of $5.4 billion of term loans and two series of senior subordinated notes.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   One at approximately $900 million and the other at $1.8 billion
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   with maturities of 2024 and 2027 respectively.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Total net debt approximated $7.4 billion at June 30 compared to $7.6 billion
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   at March 31 and $8.3 billion at $12.31, 2019.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Net debt for first lean covenant purposes is $5.2 billion
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   with net cash limited to a $200 million amount.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Our first lean covenant ratio at June 30 was approximately 3.11
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   compared to 3.52 at year end which is well below our first lean covenant of four and a quarter.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   As a reminder our first lean covenant limits cash netting to approximately $200 million.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Our total net leverage at quarter end was $4.47 compared to $5.18 at year end
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and as a reminder Nextar's only covenant is our first lean debt covenant
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   which is the aforementioned four and a quarter.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   At the onset of the pandemic Nextar took immediate actions
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   to adopt our business to the current environment to preserve liquidity
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   in order to best position the company for long term success
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   as we return to normalized operations.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   In this regard we continue to prioritize cash retention
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   and add approximately $231 million to our first quarter cash position
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   for a total cash balance of $665 million at June 30
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   with an additional $140 million available under our evolving credit facility.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   At the same time during the second quarter we returned approximately $25 million
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   to shareholders through the quarterly cash dividend
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   and made $13 million in payments on our debt.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   During the first half of 2020 we have accurately managed our capital structure
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   cost of capital and liquidity position to support our business
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   in this challenging environment while enhancing shareholder returns.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Year to date we have allocated approximately $594 million
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   towards shareholder value creating initiatives including $473 million
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   in debt reduction, $51 million in dividend payments
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and $73 million in share repurchase.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   In the near time while preliminary data suggests ongoing sequential improvement
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   in economic trends and the commercial advertising environment
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   we continue to focus on cash preservation in order to optimize our financial flexibility
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   as we move through the third quarter.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Looking ahead with continued double digit year over year growth
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and distribution revenue and what are expected to be robust spending levels
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   related to the upcoming presidential election
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   we have excellent visibility on over 50% of our annual revenue in 2020.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   As such we expect to be free cash flow positive in the third and fourth quarters
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   in addition to continuing our dividend payments we remain committed to allocating
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   the vast majority of our free cash flow towards leverage deduction
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   and confident in reaching our target level for the reduced level
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   of total net leverage to four times by year end 2020.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Next star has already made significant progress in our leverage reduction plan
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   and we enjoy a strong cash position with additional capacity under our remover.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   In addition the reduction in interest rate expense related to favorable LIBOR rates
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   operating expense savings and our capital allocation prioritization
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   will also serve us well in the second half of 2020.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   As a result we're confident in our liquidity position
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and ability to service our debt through these challenging times
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues as we move through the year.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   In summary despite the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   our scale leadership flexibility synergy realization and operation plans
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   are generating results.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Our capital structure is in great shape from a cost of capital maturity
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   and ability to quickly address leverage.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   In addition our service to our local communities
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and local and national advertisers has never been stronger.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   as well as consistency and visibility to our results
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   and we remain confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   in the near term and on the other side of the pandemic.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   That concludes the financial review for the call.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I'll now turn it over back to Perry for some closing remarks before Q&A.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Thanks very much Tom.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   In summary I hope that our comments today reinforce the fact
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   that we remain confident in the strength and the resilience
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   of next star's scaled and diversified business model.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   The next star's leading local platform is well positioned
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   to withstand this environment through the several factors including
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   the continued growth of our distribution revenue stream
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   and what are projected to be record levels of political spending here in 2020.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   In terms of capital allocation we believe that our free cash flow
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   combined with the active management of both our cost structure
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   and our balance sheet will provide us with financial flexibility
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   to continue supporting our shareholder value creation initiatives.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   As a result next star is well positioned to fully participate
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   in the recovery and we remain highly confident in our core strategies
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   in terms of serving the communities where we have operations
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   and building the top line maintaining close control
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   This focus combined with our time proven operating strategies
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   is enabling next star to overcome the near term challenges
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and extend our long term record of growth and shareholder value creation.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   We look forward very much to catching up with you
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   with another positive report just after election day
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   and on behalf of the entire next star nation
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   our board and our management team
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   thank you for your continued interest, support and for joining us today.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   So now let's open the call to Q&A
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   to address your specific areas of interest. Operator?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Yes sir, thank you.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And if you would like to ask a question please click
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   my pressing star one on your telephone keypad.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   If we are using ASpeaker phones please make sure your mute function
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   is turned off to allow your ability to retrieve equipment.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Again that is star one if you would like to ask a question
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and we'll take our first question from John Janities with Wolfe Research.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Thank you, Paria, two for you.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   One is you talked about local news and viewership.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   What do you think in terms of advertising your demand
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   in growth and news relative to the day parts
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   given the ratings you spoke to and then
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I guess the sub-levels in line with expectations
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   is the reintroduce that there has been no noticeable impact
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   from the pandemic or is that just your call given the life?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Well as it relates to local news you know through the first six months
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   of this year 51% of our total advertising revenue came from local news
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   and that's up over the prior years cumulative totals
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   which indicates obviously advertisers you know are putting their money
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   into that product with increasing frequency.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Obviously the demand is where the audience is
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and that's where the audience is for us right now
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and so we do see continued read through
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and we're hopeful that the audience gains at least some of them will be sticky
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   when you know and I hate to use this term
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   when the new normal settles in as to whatever that is
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   but so far through this normal people in all age groups
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   are tuning to our local news broadcasts in increasing numbers.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   I will say that obviously MBPD's have reported
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   sub-counts and attrition for the quarter you know
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   those are factored into our projections and analyses
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   and our retrans revenue is again we forecast attrition
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   into our budgeting process and we are at budget
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   on retrans revenue and our projections through the end of this year
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   so we have seen no significant decline beyond what we had forecasted
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   so we think it's business as usual from a distribution revenue standpoint.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Thanks very much.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Our next question will come from Steven Call with Wells Fargo.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Thanks.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Wondering if you could talk a little bit about your reverse compensation agreement
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   as sub-declines are accelerating
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   if that's changing the tone of those at all
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   and also does it make you think about moving from like a per sub basis
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   sorry to a per sub basis from a fixed programming fee where you can
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   and relatedly we have more broadcast content
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   going direct to consumer like CBS All Access and Peacock
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   so how do you think about monetizing those households
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   that may not be subscribing through the traditional process?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Sure. I would say the current relationships with the networks
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   are a mix of fixed fee and percentages of distribution revenue
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   so there are some that are fungible and others that are not
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   and those conversations are continuing
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   what's in the best interest of both parties to get a deal done
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   so there is some hedge there at this point
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   and we're not ready to call the ball as to what the most preferable term is
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   there based on our negotiating ability
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   as it relates to CBS All Access we participate in that
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   we're paid to be a part of that service
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   and our local stream is a part of that offering
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Peacock we are not affiliate local news
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast offering
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and we're not sure if at any point they will be
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   but we do have this thing called over the air
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   which we reach a much larger universe
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   potentially than the wired pay cable universe already
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   where 16% of our viewers already use that
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   as their reception device without the aid of a pay wall
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and that's available to those who want to quote stream us that way
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   if you will and the good news about that
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   is there are far few competitors for eyeballs
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   in an over the air world
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   than there are in a 500 plus cable or satellite universe
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   so again we are in flux
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   we have a lot of our agreements nailed down through 21 and 22
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   we do have some that will be up
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   end of this year and early next year
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   and that's where those conversations will center around
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   the best type of agreement for both companies to enter into
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   great and I just went on political four years ago
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   we kind of got a head fake at the last minute
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   from the Trump campaign in terms of not spending what was expected
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I don't think any of us expect that to happen this time
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   but when do you feel comfortable
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   that there's not going to be any negative surprises
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   on the political spending side
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I'm pretty comfortable in that right now
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I mean look at the amount of money that both camps have raised
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   that the attendant PACs and special interest groups
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   have raised supporting those candidates
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   as well as down valid candidates
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   there are no guarantees in this business
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   but as close as the guarantees I'll make is
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   there'll be no negative surprise on political advertising
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   That's a pretty good guarantee, thank you
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   We'll now take our next question from Zach Silver with B Riley
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Okay great, thanks for hearing the question
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   The first one is just if you can quantify the sequential improvement
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   for Core in July versus Total 2Q20
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   or even the pro forma year over year change so far in July
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and then more broadly and I think it's a little bit related to Stephen's question
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   you know the narrative out there has been
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   that the macro environment and growth and streaming
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   is going to accelerate the shift of ad dollars
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   from linear TV to connected TV and streaming
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   can you talk about how well positioned you are to address that
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   that narrative does turn out to play out
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Tom I'll let you address how linear you want to get on guidance
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   obviously we saw substantial sequential improvement
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   in Core ad trends in July versus not only June
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   but the entire quarter
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Tom I don't know if you want to add any more details to that
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   but I'll let you speak to that
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Sure well I think what I'll say about July is obviously
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   July was substantially better than the second quarter as a whole
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   and July was better than the last month of the second quarter
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   so sequentially things have gotten better
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   and that trend continues into early Q3
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   As it relates to additional streaming services
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   you know there at some point there becomes not kind of a sameness to them
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   and you know it's all about the content
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   if you have the content that people want
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   they will find a way to consume you
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   whether that's over the air or whether that's through a pay service
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   or through a streaming service that we're paid to be on
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   and without our services you have an inferior offering
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   to the viewing public
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   it is obviously demonstrated that local news is a product
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   that people want and are willing to pay for
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and so I think we'll just stand by that
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   you know it's a lot less noisy at the operating level
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   than it is perhaps at the investor level
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   about these streaming services
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   you know is it a fragmenting universe
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   but are they just taking from a wire
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   from a traditional pay TV universe
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   into a virtual pay TV universe
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and if so and we're on both sides of that transaction
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   it's not nearly the noise that it appears to be
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   in the investment community
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   so we're somewhat sanguine about it
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   you know we have a product that people want
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   we're the largest producer of it in the country
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   it's called local news
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and we believe that product will stand the test of time
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   as it has for the last 40 years test of time
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Yeah I think that makes sense
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and one more if I could
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   does the target leverage ratio for this year contemplate
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   any buybacks in the second half
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   and can you remind us of where we are
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   in resuming the repurchase program
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   thanks
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   it does I won't say how much of it
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   is allocated to stock repurchases
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   the way we think we have an authorization left
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   from the board we're currently not buying stock
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   but I would anticipate that to get revisited here
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   in the not too distant future
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   the way we think about it is
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   really starting on Labor Day and quite honestly
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   that's probably not doing service to
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   the fact that it's pretty mentioned
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   July political revenue is very strong
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   and we think August will be as well
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   we're rapidly transitioning out of this being a story
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   during the pandemic just about poor advertising revenue
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and what's happening there
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   the other two legs to the stool from our perspective
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   distribution revenue has been strong
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   continues to be strong as Perry mentioned
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   we're on budget for the year
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   we're on budget for the second we were on
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   we were actually above budget for the second quarter
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   we're on budget for the third quarter
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   with regard to retransmission revenues
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   and then the third leg of the stool
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   is political and that's really going
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   that candle is going to get lit
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   here right around Labor Day
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   and run really hard for the two months
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   of September, October and the first week of November
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   so the free cash flow with the company
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   will continue to go along nicely
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   and then get turbocharged by free cash flow
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   from political beginning around Labor Day
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   as I've said to other people
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   we fully expect our capital allocation
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   attitude to change from playing defense
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   to playing offense sometime right around Labor Day
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   we're not there yet but I can see there from here
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   and when that happens then I would imagine
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   we wouldn't sit here with an unnatural
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   $600 million of cash on our balance sheet
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   we deploy that by actually repaying debt
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   and looking at stock repurchases
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   but that's a multivariable equation
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   tell me what the stock is around that time
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   and I'll tell you what our appetite is
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   right is that responsive?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Yeah, that's helpful thank you both
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   I just want to add to Tom's comment about political
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   most folks woke up this morning
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   reading about Biden's buy
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   that he's placing starting on September 1
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   then 15 states we operate substantial operations
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   in 12 of those 15 states
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   so just to point out that
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   political will reach a crescendo around Labor Day
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   that will continue on through the first week of November
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   and again with July results being above
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   all of second quarter for political
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   that's a pretty good measure I think
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   of what's yet to come
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   and so we remain confident in our political guidance
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   and as that story continues to prove
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   then I think you'll see Tom exercise more optionality
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   around our cash forward
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   that currently exists on the balance sheet
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Got it, thanks Gary
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Well now I'll take our next question
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   from Erin Woff with Deutsche Bank
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Hi guys thanks for having me on
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   couple questions on the ad environment
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   I guess first
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   there's been some fits and starts
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   in terms of COVID cases
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   in the pockets of the country
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   what behavior
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   in your markets that have been affected by that
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   and I guess on a related note
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   in terms of categories
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   just give me the importance of the auto category
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   anything you can give us
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   in terms of how that rebound is shaping up
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   and what you're expecting from auto in the next couple months
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Yeah auto has rebounded
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   we're seeing better pacing
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   and better results in Q3
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   than we did in Q2
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   when dealers were shut down
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   we're seeing certain of the OEMs move
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   money around from market to market
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   based on where they have cars
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   and that's primarily affected some of the foreign name place
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   but on the whole I think our expectations
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   for auto are that it will be less down
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   sequentially going forward
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   as will most of core advertising
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   As it related to COVID
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   I didn't know if you meant how it affected the company
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   or what we're seeing in our markets
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   but I can give you a little color on both
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   we have had 145 confirmed cases
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   in the company
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   since the beginning of the pandemic
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   remarkably out of a workforce
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   of about 13,000
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   of people that are out in the community
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   we've only had one hospitalization
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   and that person is fully recovered
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   about 60% of our employees
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   are working from the facility
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   to which they are assigned
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   we have another 20% that are reporting to work
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   but not necessarily in the facility
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   reporters meeting their crews in the field
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   to go to their first assignment
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   and things of that sort
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   20% that are working remotely
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   and I use the example with our board
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   that everybody in Topeka is reporting to work
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   however nobody is populating our New York offices
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   because of the public transportation requirements
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   and they don't feel safe
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   and there's certainly no mandate to do that
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   and so that's kind of a proxy for the country
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   we keep tabs by every market
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   as to various stages of reopening
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   I would say that all of our markets
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   have some degree of reopening
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   some more than others
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   there have been some pauses in California
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   and Texas and others on further reopening
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   areas have been rolled back
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   bars and restaurants
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   are not necessarily big advertising categories
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   with us to begin with
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   hospitality continues to be
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   a category where we see no spend
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   to speak of
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   there is some interest
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   a tourism ads that are going on
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   like if you're in Texas come to Arkansas
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   and vice versa in Oklahoma
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   we're seeing some of that
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   but hospitality for us is a sub 2% category
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   that is not materially driving our top line
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   so Aaron I don't know if that's
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   the kind of flavor you were looking for
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   but I'm happy to answer any more specific follow up
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   one last one for me and I appreciate the time again
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   you spoke to the important local news
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   and the ad revenues that come in
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   attached to that to the overall revenue pie
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   if we're thinking about the potential
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   that maybe NFL football delayed
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   or college football doesn't happen in the fall
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   how do we think about the flow through
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   of that potential
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   and what it could mean to your revenue pie
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   sure I'm glad you asked that
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   it's interesting at the local station level
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   which is where we live
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   all sports comprises
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   about 10% of our advertising revenue
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   and of that the NFL comprises
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   about 60% of that 10%
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   so let's just in real round numbers say
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   that ad revenue support is half of our revenue
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   and NFL is 6% of 10% of that
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   so we're talking about 3 points of revenue
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   so from an advertising perspective
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   because of the limited avail that the local stations
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   get in all of local sports
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   or all of televised sports that's not local
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   it's not that big of a contributor
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   but obviously it has an outsized
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   effect on viewership
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   on promotional ability
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   and I would say on the national psyche
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   and on people's morale
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   obviously distributors are very interested
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   in live sports because they know live sports
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   and live news drive viewership
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   but from a pure financial advertising point of view
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   it's not all that material
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   to our top or bottom line
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   okay perfect
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   that's exactly what I was looking for
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   stay well guys
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   thank you
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   our next question will be from Brian Kraft
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   with Deutsche Bank
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   hi I have two questions
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   first I'm wondering if you could give us
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   some color on what you're seeing
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   in terms of subscriber declines in your markets
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   curious how they compare to the overall industry
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and any color
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   on advertising and distributed reception
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   to news nation
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   and any expectations for when you might see
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   some incremental revenue lift from news nation
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   thanks
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Tom I'll let you read the subscriber
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   and then I'll talk about Tia and how's that
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   sure
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   I would say our
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   experience with subscribers
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   is not materially different than that
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   of the
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   the MVPDs obviously
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   we are still getting an uplift
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   from the virtual MVPDs
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   so that the
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   the traditional MVPD subscriber loss
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   is somewhat recouped but certainly not all recouped
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   by
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   by the virtual MVPDs
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   and as Perry had mentioned
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   obviously we factor in
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   in our budgeting process and in our guidance process
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   you know an attrition rate
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   for subscribers
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   and a
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   a unit rate for our
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   for our revenue
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   and as we mentioned that was basically in line
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   for the second quarter
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   and early returns for the third quarter
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   are consistent with that
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   expectation so
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   not getting into
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   specific subscriber decline numbers
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   etc I would say that
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   we we see and feel
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   the same thing that the
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   you know the distributors do
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   it's just that our
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   you know our economics are a little bit different
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   because we've got
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   you know rate that helps us offset that
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   but it's consistent with our expectations
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   as relates to WGN America
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   we have had and you know
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Dana Zimmer and her team have been out
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   presenting WGN America
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   to every MVPD
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   which we already do business
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   and also those that do not carry WGN
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   WGN America and that's primarily
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   in legacy next star markets
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   and we have an opportunity
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   with renewals between now
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   in the end of the year
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   for an incremental approximately
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   200 to 250,000
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   subs that could add WGN America
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   and these are smaller systems again
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   where next car has a relationship
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   but there was no trivia relationship
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   that would have included WGN America
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   so there is upside there
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   and and I would say that
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   the reception from distributors has been
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   positive particularly from those
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   who have existing contracts
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   and realize there's going to be additional
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   value add for no additional cost
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   during the term of the current agreement
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   we are
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   distributed on AT&T now
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   as the
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   the only virtual MVPD
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   service that is offering WGN America
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   we are efforting
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   to get distribution
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   at the launch
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   or shortly thereafter
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   on other OTT services
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   and that will be value add
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   where WGN America is not currently distributed
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   but the reception
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   from both the advertising community
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   and the distribution community has been positive
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   because we are investing in a product
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   that will add value to their businesses
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   as well.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Great, thanks
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   I guess I'll ask you
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   one follow up to the prior
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Perry. I don't know if you're willing
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   to good color
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   on subcarriage incremental
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   opportunity. Is there any way
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   for us to think about timing
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   and higher thinking about
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   the news nation impact itself
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   relative to either advertising
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   or
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   I guess ancillarily
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   with your comment on carriage
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   we know it's going to be self funding
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   just to kind of expand it
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   so just any help kind of framing
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   your thoughts on sort of
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   the magnitude of that opportunity
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   and then separately
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   you know obviously there's been a lot of noise
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   lately in the digital world
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Facebook, Twitter
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   Advoid caught up to all of that fun stuff
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   you guys are the largest
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   you guys have a pretty big network effect
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   and a pretty strong digital portfolio yourselves
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   is there any accrued benefit to you guys
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   or do you think that stays mostly in the digital
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   bucket? Thanks
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   I'll speak first to
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   WGN America
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   we have
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   I'm very impressed with the job that Dave
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   wrote him and the sales team have done
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   in assembling
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   advertisers for
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   the premier week of WGN
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   America's news nation
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   blue chip names and
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   at cost per points that are
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   in excess of
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   I'm sorry I should say cost per thousands
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   that are in excess
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   50% greater than what
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   standard programming was generating
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   alone
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   so that's a very positive
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   initial indication we're trying to rework
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   some of the existing buys
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   into
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   the news nation prime time offering
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   and so
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   what we could really use
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   is you know an upfront or a fourth quarter
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   scatter market to break
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   but all of that said we do anticipate
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   an incremental
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   let's call it low
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   eight figure
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   revenue contribution
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   to WGN's ad revenue
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   in the four months of the
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   end of this year
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   and again given the size and scope of
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   the operation that wouldn't be deemed to be material
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   but we do even in
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   these conditions expect
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   a low eight figure
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   uplift in gross revenue there
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   and distribution
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   that will mostly come at the end
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   of the year so we'll impact
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   2021 more than this year
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   there have been some incremental deals
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   done already that will launch
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   WGN America
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   between now and the end of the year
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   but I would say the vast majority of that impact
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   would be felt
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   in 2021
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   and again you're talking a potential uplift
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   of a quarter of a million subscribers
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   on a
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Nielsen reported I think 75 million
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   subscribers
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   but even that is incremental
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   but it's all incremental
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   and that's what we're going to do
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   is drive incremental growth out of the assets
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   that we own
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   and then the thoughts
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   on either Facebook, Twitter
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   as it relates to core political
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   if that stays in the digital bucket
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   or if you can pick some of that up
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   listen I think the most direct
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   transfer could be in political
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   if certain platforms are refusing
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   somewhere and
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   without conventions
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   to fund and without rallies
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   to fund the one way
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   to reach people is through broadcast television
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   I think we're seeing an evidence of that right now
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   so I think that would be probably
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   the direct transfer
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   with all the boycats and all of that
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   I don't think you've seen a substantial
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   decline
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   in digital revenue
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   performance on those platforms
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   so at this point
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   the damage is more reputational than
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   financial and we'll see
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   how deep the government
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   wants to get involved
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   in taking a look and potentially
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   regulating these companies
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   more symmetrically with the way we're regulated
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   but at this point
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   I think the financial
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   transfer outside of political
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   to the best of our knowledge is minimal
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Got it super helpful
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   thanks for the coloring next quarter
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   Thanks
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   next question will come from
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Greg Hubber with Hubber Resource Partners
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Yes good morning
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   thank you
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   last quarter
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   on your conference call
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   I believe you guys said
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   retransubs were down
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   4.5% year over year
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   as you guys may know
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   Sinclair on the call
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   right before yours said the second quarter subs
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   were down about 7%
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   clean a bit benefit than the virtual side
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   I assume that you guys were down
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   roughly about 7%
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   for the second quarter for your subs
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   is that reasonable slightly worse than the first quarter
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   No
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   Should I assume it's
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   a little bit better than that then
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   or can you just help me understand
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   I would say it's more consistent
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   with the second quarter
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   The second quarter
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   I'm sorry you need more consistent with the first quarter
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   down 4.5%
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   sorry with what we announced
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   the first quarter
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   but now I wouldn't say it's down 4
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   correct I'm not going to give the exact number
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   I've already said that
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   it's not down 7
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   but it's closer to the
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   previous quarters results
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   Okay I appreciate that
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   Can you help us
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   your TV advertising
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   pacing for the month of August
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   would you say that those are tracking better
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   the rate of decline there
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   if your core advertising for that is tracking
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   better than what you
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   what July turned out to be
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   I think it's a little
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   we have very few days
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   in August here
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   I'm thinking it's a little
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   too early to be making any
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   comments with regard to that
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Can you help us then maybe just
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   understand
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   then what you're sort of budgeting
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   or thinking the rate of decline
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   for your core advertising to be down
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   in the third quarter
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   maybe help us
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   I think that's why we're not
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   giving guidance
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   right
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   How much July was down
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   if you would
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   I think I told you it was down less
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   again I'm not going to give
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   specific numbers
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   but July was
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   down less than June
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   and June was obviously if
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   it's just math if the entire
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   quarter was down 35%
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   and every month within the
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   second quarter got better
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   then clearly June was down
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   less than 35%
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   and July was down less
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   than June
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   that's kind of the extent of the
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   forward looking guidance that we're going to give
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   as it relates to specific
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   advertising revenue
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Okay
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   maybe let me ask
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   another question then on this
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   virus situation that's going out there
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   in the states
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   where the virus cases have gotten
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   dramatically worse here in the last several
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   weeks have you guys seen a material
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   change in the core
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   advertising in those markets
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   is there any significant change
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   or you can talk about that
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   no
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   and again
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   cases in Texas
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   have gone down
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   we don't operate just in one
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   area that you're in that you might be hearing
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   that news from right so
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   you've got to look across 114
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   markets and look at
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   those states and
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   cases might be reported to be up 30%
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   which could be 100 cases
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   in a state I mean
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   you've got to put all of these numbers into context
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   and I would say
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   no the evidence is
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   in our results in July
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   and our pacing in August and our pacing in September
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   all substantially better
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   than where we exited second quarter
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   and then we performed in second quarter
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   so the proof is in the numbers
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   as Tom says it's just math but we have not seen
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   any and I think I just said this
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   hospitality continues
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   to be down auto is improving
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   we don't get a lot of money from restaurants
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   unless it's QSR and they're making mint
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   right through so
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   things are we're seeing
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   steady improvements
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   and even we're
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   pausing and opening is
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   better than not being open at all and
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   that's kind of our worst case scenario
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   in some of our markets and in others
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   we don't have that.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   This morning we're dealing with the aftermath
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   of storms up the east coast from the Carolinas
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   into Virginia and up into
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   Pennsylvania and New York and flooding
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   and those kinds of things and those are going to be more
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   you know temporary disruptors
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   to businesses until they
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   can reopen than the pandemic
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   and so it's situational and we deal
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   in 38 states across the country
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   and you've got to add it all together
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   but there's you know
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   nothing other than business as usual is the way
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   we deal with things and I think the results
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   speak for themselves.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   My last question guys
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   on the cost front you guys talked about pro forma
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   cost in the second quarter down 18%
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   can you give us a little bit more
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   how we should we think about your cost
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   trends for the third quarter
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   I know you gave a figure there versus your budget
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   for the third quarter you have somewhere one
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   for the second quarter but just what sort
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   of cost that you could help us a little bit
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   think about that may not repeat the cost savings
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   in the third quarter you benefit from
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   in the second. Thank you.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   I really
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   don't understand the question other than the fact
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   obviously we had
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   guided to $40 million
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   in cost takeouts in the second quarter
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   which we believe
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   which we over performed on
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   that same number
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   for the third quarter is 25 million
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   as we obviously
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   some of those are variable costs as advertising
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   starts to return those costs go up
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   some of them are discretionary
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   that we will add back in
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   we will travel more
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   in the third quarter than we did in the second
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   quarter we basically couldn't have traveled any less
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   in the second quarter than we did
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   so some of the discretionary cost
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   will get added back in
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   but that will be more than offset
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   by
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   higher advertising revenues
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   in the second quarter but specifically
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   as it relates to
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   you know if you're looking year over year
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   the majority of the
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   synergies taken out of the
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   Tribune transaction have occurred
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   so that won't change
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   materially sequentially
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   Q2 Q3 over Q2
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   and you'll have some added
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   expense coming back in
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   but that's the
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   extent of some of the pushes and the pulls
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   on expenses
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   you answered well thank you
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   appreciate that guys
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   we'll now take our next question
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   from John Cornrice with JK Media
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   I hope
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   you can hear me having
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   problems like a lot of people in neighborhood
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   two quickies
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   Tom
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   I think the 24 bonds
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   were callable two days ago
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   and I heard nothing
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   meaning that it's not likely to be called
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   well again John
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   I think that's consistent with
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   our message that
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   you know in the next 30 to
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   45 days I think we will
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   have a better
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   feel on actual
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   political revenue coming in
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   you know Labor Day and obviously
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   same with another month
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   core and we'll be able to start
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   making
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   more aggressive decisions
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   with regard to capital allocation
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   in the you know obviously in the last
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   120 days
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   and probably the next 30 days
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   we're still going to continue to take a pretty
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   conservative view on that
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   but hopefully be able to flip
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   the switch and become a little bit more
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   aggressive in the near term
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   secondly did I hear correctly
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   that you're on track
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   for mid-teens
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   net retrans growth
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   this year
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   and you mentioned that
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   the gross
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   retrans
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   is up high 20s
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   pro forma
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   did I hear correctly gross high 20s
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   net net teams
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   so far this year
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   our
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   retrans revenue growth has exceeded
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   20% that is correct
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   we have budgeted
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   for mid-teens
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   well 28 in the second quarter
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   I forget
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   exactly the first quarter is we budgeted
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   for mid-teens growth
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   in net retrans
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   for the entire year
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   but so far we have exceeded that
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   okay so net
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   but net retrans margins are down
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   you know more than a little bit
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   for this year
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   is that correct
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   no I would say that they're actually
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   up a little bit because
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   we've included
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   a fair amount of probium subscribers
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   that are non-Big 4 affiliates
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   where our net retrans margin
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   is substantially in excess of 50%
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   got it
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   thank you very much
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   we'll now take our next question
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   from Jim Goss
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   is there any research
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   thanks
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   during the early days
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   of the pandemic
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   there seemed to be a surge
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   a pretty good increase at least
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   in usage
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   and even sampling
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   of broadcast and other video
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   in categories
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   that didn't take
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   or didn't tend to
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   be requested
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   not sure what happened there
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   but I was wondering
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   if any of that has proven
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   sustainable
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   if you would like to cancel this request
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   please press star zero again
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   I'm sorry I may have heard
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   go ahead Jim I think somebody
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   is trying to either record
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   or exit the call
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   okay sorry
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   but anyway I was wondering if any of the increased usage
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   and sampling
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   has proven sustainable
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   or has it mostly dissipated
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   and did any of that play a role
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   in your retrans negotiations
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   during that period
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   we had precious few retrans
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   negotiations
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   done in the first half
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   of the year
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   we had one top 10
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   that we're pleased with the results on
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   I would say
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   in my comments earlier
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   I did report that
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   our viewership
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   highlighted the 18-34 demographic
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   obviously was up in April
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   151%
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   83% in May
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   and 89% in June
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   over the prior year
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   page views which were in excess
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   of 2.3 billion
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   for the quarter were 1.1 billion
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   in April that was up 133%
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   and then in the month of June
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   just by comparison our local websites were up
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   60% compared to the prior year
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   so
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   there is some
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   covid fatigue I think
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   but I also think there is increased
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   interest in local news
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   and we consider ourselves
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   to be the last bastion
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   of local news with the
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   diminuation of newspaper and radio
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   local coverage and content
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   so
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   we do think that there is stickiness to this
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   you know the long tail
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   will determine how much
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   but people continue to turn
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   to our newscasts and record numbers
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   and it's amazing
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   ATLA in Los Angeles
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   and WGN in Chicago
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   independent stations by and large
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   but producing copious amounts
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   local news
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   our ranking number 1 in all day cards
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   meeting all of the network O and O's
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   in virtually every newscast
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   and it just speaks to the power of localism
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   that you're not dependent on
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   network lead in or lead out
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   to generate your audience
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   you're doing it on your own
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   and we're particularly gratified
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   by that kind of execution
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   producing those kinds of results
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   and one last thing
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   I was wondering about
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   promotion efforts to create
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   visibility for
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   news nation as that is
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   coming to the fore
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   and also it seems like
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   CNN tended to
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   fill a
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   similar role to that which
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   you're targeting where
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   they tend to be unbiased
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   maybe it's a little less so these days
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   and during that
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   era it would tend to
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   be the place to go
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   and something
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   an event occurred that
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   some of the other news
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   more pointed
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   newscasts
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   politically would
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   sort of gather their base
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   in more normal times
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   so I'm wondering if there's a way for
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   you to position yourself
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   to sort of gather
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   at least that role
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   and maybe
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   have something more sustainable
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   if this proves successful
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   do you think you've broadened it
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   beyond the three-hour original time frame
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   well thanks Jim
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   there's a lot in there to unpack
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   I'll try and do my best with it here
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   obviously
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   that is how CNN started
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   I don't think anyone listening to this call
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   thinks CNN is in that same place today
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   from an unbiased
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   political lean
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   we as I've said before
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   we have a staff of returitions
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   full time staff that do nothing
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   but check scripts and reporting
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   for unconscious bias
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   and bias in our writing
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   and we've had very spirited discussions
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   about that even in the rehearsals
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   we
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   we do think we will be that place to go
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   for news that doesn't make
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   a 22 minute news hole
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   in a network evening news broadcast
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   or much news on
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   the opinion based talk networks
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   for example last night
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   in our rehearsals we did a story
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   on the first women police chief
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   in Colorado Springs
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   and that's not a story you'd see every place else
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   but again we've got our
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   we've got the country divided up into six zones
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   and we have zone producers
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   and their job is to know exactly what's going on
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   in those zones
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   in all of those newsrooms
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   and what might be of interest to a national audience
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   in addition to the 150 people
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   we've hired in Chicago
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   correspondents that are also based in Miami
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   New York, Dallas, Los Angeles
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   and DC
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   that report exclusively for the network
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   as well as all the behind the scenes
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   production folks that
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   we think we can give
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   a more representative view of America
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   than perhaps what's seen inside
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   the New York DC
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   Beltway
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   so we think there's a purpose for that
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   and there's a reason for that
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   and the acceptance of that concept now
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   has been very enthusiastic
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   now just on us to deliver
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   as it relates to promotion
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   we have
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   secured something that none of the other
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   networks, news networks
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   I think are able to compete with
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   and that is to harness the power
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   of 196 television stations
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   across the next generation
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   to promote this newscast
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   on a day-to-day specific basis
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   beginning later this month
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   and
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   if you look at the annualized promotion
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   value that the stations will be contributing
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   on a dedicated basis
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   it's something approaching $100 million
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   we are layering
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   on top of that on an annualized basis
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   approximately $20 million
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   of
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   outside promotion expense
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   which primarily goes for
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   advertising on other cable networks
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   because we're just a channel
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   change away at that point
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   on national and syndicated radio
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   we're also
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   investing heavily in social media
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   not only because of the app
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   but to try and drive a younger demographic
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   to an alternative newscast
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   we think our promotion
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   spending all taken together
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   a nine-figure amount
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   of both cash and in-kind contributions
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   for the company are another asset
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   that
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   will hopefully drive success for this effort
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   and again
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   it is a counter-programming
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   opportunity
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   in prime time
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   and we're going to do our best to succeed there
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   obviously if we are successful
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   we would look at other day parts
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   but we're taking very much of a crawl-walk-run approach
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   to this
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   we want to get it right
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   and we will grow as fast as our success
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   would allow us to grow
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   so I think I'd leave it at that
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   but we're very excited
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   about the prospect of
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   introducing an alternative
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   in prime time to entertainment
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   and opinion-programming
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   and that the product
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   we'll strike a chord
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   and resonate with the audience
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   and audience growth
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   and advertiser growth will continue
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   so
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   tune in it launches on September 1
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   thanks for your care for a while
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   and that does conclude our question
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   and answer session for today
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   and we look forward to seeing you again
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   soon
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   well thank you operator
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   again we're very pleased
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   at our progress and we're pleased
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   at our strong financial position
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   and we're excited about the launch of WG in America
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   and the advent of the political spending season
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   that will all be upon us
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   before our next call
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   so we look forward reporting back to you
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   shortly after election day
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   with the early results on all of those efforts
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   and thank you very much for your time this morning
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   thanks for joining us
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   once again that does conclude today's conference
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   we thank you all for your participation
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   you may now disconnect

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Aldeira's therapeutic
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.800]   second quarter 2020 financial results conference call.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.120]   At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.240]   After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.640]   To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.800]   If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.140]   Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040]   If you require further assistance, please press star zero.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.840]   I would now like to introduce the company's chief financial officer, Mr. Josh Reedy.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.280]   Mr. Joshua Reedy.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.280]   Thank you.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.320]   You may begin.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.360]   Thank you and good morning everyone.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.760]   On the call with me are Dr. Todd Brady, Aldeira's president and chief executive officer and David
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.280]   McMullen, our chief commercial officer.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.880]   Dr. Brady will begin with an overview of our recent highlights and upcoming clinical milestones.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.000]   I will discuss our second quarter financial results and then we'll take your questions.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.600]   Please note that this morning's conference call contains forward looking statements regarding
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.720]   future events and the future performance of Aldeira.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.840]   Forward looking statements include statements regarding the timing of planned clinical trial
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.360]   initiation, Aldeira's possible or assumed future results of operations, expenses and financial
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.180]   positions, business strategies and plans, research development and commercial plans or
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.520]   expectations, trends, market sizing, competitive position, industry environment and potential
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.880]   growth opportunities among other things.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.920]   These statements are based upon the information available to the company today.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.400]   As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical site availability, staffing and patient recruitment
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.200]   have been negatively affected and the timelines to complete our clinical trials may be delayed.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.360]   Aldeira assumed no obligation to update these statements as circumstances change.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.380]   Future events and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the company's
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.960]   forward looking statements including the current and potential future impact of the COVID-19
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.800]   pandemic on our business results of operations and financial position.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.920]   No information concerning factors that could cause results to differ materially from our
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.560]   forward looking statements are described in greater detail and the company's press release
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.320]   issued this morning containing financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.080]   company's filing with the SEC.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.760]   And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Todd Brady, our President and Chief Executive
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.560]   Officer.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.800]   Thank you Joshua and good morning everyone.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.720]   As our industry and healthcare first responders continue working together to defeat the worst
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.240]   public health crisis in a century, our thoughts are with those affected by COVID-19.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.640]   The seemingly relentless spread of the novel coronavirus has made 2020 a tragic and surreal
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.200]   year but we remain hopeful and confident in the abilities of our industry to develop the
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.640]   therapies necessary to extinguish this virulent disease.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.000]   I again want to especially thank our team for their work and dedication to our mission
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.560]   developing first and class medicines to approve the lives of patients with immunological diseases
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   whose conditions are not being adequately treated by the current standard of care.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.640]   From our perspective the key pipeline development to the second quarter was our type C meeting
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.920]   with the FDA which charted the remaining clinical pathway to an NDA submission for topical oculocular
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.640]   raproxalap in dry eye disease.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.960]   The meeting culminated in an agreement to use levels of reactive aldehyde species or
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.160]   rasp the therapeutic target for raproxalap as an objective sign in point for subsequent
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.800]   clinical evaluation.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.960]   In the fourth quarter of this year we plan to initiate clinical testing to assess the
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.600]   activity of topical oculocular raproxalap in reducing cure levels of rasp and other objective
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.800]   signs of dry eye disease and we expect preliminary results by the end of the year.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.000]   The timing of the clinical trial is of course subject to finalization of trial designed
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.040]   rasp assay development and potential disruptions due to COVID 19.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.320]   Initiation of a safety study in dry eye disease patients is also planned for the fourth quarter
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.040]   and NDA submission is expected by the end of 2021.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.320]   Our optimism for the use of rasp as an objective sign of dry eye disease is supported by data
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:04.200]   from our successful phase 2A trial in which raproxalap treatment diminish levels of rasp
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.000]   and tears as measured by ELISA following 28 days of treatment.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.760]   For the upcoming rasp trials the longest duration of dosing under consideration is also 28 days
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.160]   whereas the shortest dosing duration is 1 to 2 days.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.280]   Additionally the upcoming rasp trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:34.280]   effect of acute changes in dryness on rasp and other signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.240]   We'll be sharing additional details of the protocol following rasp assay validation
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.320]   and FDA requirement and look forward to providing trial designs shortly.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.320]   From a safety perspective topical oculocular raproxalap already has been evaluated in
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.040]   more than 1000 patients with no observed safety concerns.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.840]   In short the safety consistency and clinically significant activity of raproxalap across
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.700]   numerous clinical trials suggests that raproxalap could be an important addition to the limited
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.200]   number of therapeutic options for dry eye disease which affects more than 30 million
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.320]   patients in the United States.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.120]   Following at other ocular programs in our pipeline top line results from the phase 3
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.880]   and vigorate allergen chamber trial of raproxalap and allergic conjunctivitis are expected in
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.520]   the first half of 2021.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.840]   In the retinal disease area in the second quarter of this year the European Commission granted
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.880]   orphan medicinal product designation to ADX 2191 for the treatment of retinal detachment
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.420]   opening a new market opportunity for ADX 2191 and the European Union as drugs receiving
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.520]   the orphan medicinal product designation are eligible to protocol assistance, research
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.160]   funding and upon approval 10 years of EU market exclusivity.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:10.040]   ADX 2191 our novel and proprietary intravitral methotrexate injection is being evaluated in
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.280]   the phase 3 guard trial for proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.000]   PVR is a rare but site threatening condition and the leading cause of failure of retinal
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.240]   detachment surgery affecting roughly 4,000 patients per year in the United States and
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.760]   nearly twice as many in Europe and Japan combined.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.760]   Given the nature of PVR and given the clinical site delays caused by COVID-19 the progress
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.360]   of guard has been slow although we expect to provide you with an update by the end of
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   this year.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:52.240]   As many of you know there is no approved therapy for PVR and ADX 2191 has received orphan
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.320]   drug and fast track designations from the FDA.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:04.960]   ADX 2191 is also the subject of our new clinical program in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.840]   or PVRL a rare aggressive high grade cancer that affects approximately 2900 people in
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.720]   the United States with about 600 new cases diagnosed annually.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.440]   There are no approved treatments for the disease although the standard of care is pharmacy compounded
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.680]   methotrexate that has been injected into the eye.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:35.880]   We have recently filed for orphan drug designation for ADX 2191 in PVRL.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:42.280]   Turning to our systemic disease program we are very excited about ADX 629 which to our
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.520]   knowledge is the first systemically available rasp inhibitor the clinical testing of which
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:55.920]   represents the first time systemic rasp inhibition has been assessed clinically marking an exciting
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.040]   new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism of action.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:07.920]   An IND has been filed with the FDA for phase 2 clinical testing of ADX 629 in patients
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:15.440]   with COVID 19 in order to prevent cytokine relief syndrome and respiratory compromise.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.960]   Clinical development is expected to begin this year.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.640]   In an animal model of cytokine storm ADX 629 demonstrated a broad and highly statistically
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.680]   significant reduction in cytokine levels including TNF alpha interferon gamma in IL 17 while
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.960]   up regulating the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL 10.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.200]   The data suggests that rasp inhibitors have the potential to represent immunological switches
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:53.880]   which may modulate immune systems from pro-inflammatory states to anti-inflammatory states.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.360]   In the fourth quarter of this year we also expect to initiate clinical trials of ADX
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:06.120]   629 in psoriasis and autoimmune disease and atopic asthma and allergic disease.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.040]   In combination trials in COVID 19 psoriasis and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.620]   and the results of the trials will characterize the immune modulating activity of ADX 629
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.960]   and rasp inhibition more generally.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:32.080]   Switching to ADX 1612 our novel HSP90 inhibitor enrollment has been completed in the investigator
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.640]   sponsored phase 2 Udario trial in ovarian cancer.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:44.800]   Regarding the ADX 1612 COVID 19 program consistent with FDA feedback additional pre-clinical
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:53.020]   antiviral testing of ADX 1612 against SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID 19 will be performed
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:58.360]   by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases which has accepted our request to
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.120]   evaluate ADX 1612 and in vivo models.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:12.960]   We plan to update on the ADX 1612 COVID program by the end of 2020.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.160]   We approach the midpoint of the third quarter in a strong financial position enhancing our
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.360]   flexibility with recent common stock sales the two healthcare focused funds perceptive
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:33.320]   advisors and identity partners these transactions raise growth proceeds of approximately 19.5
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:39.160]   million completing our previously announced at the market offering program.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:45.160]   We expect our cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations through 2022 including
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:53.000]   potential reproxelap approval in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.360]   Now with that I'd like to turn the call back over to Josh for the financial review.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:08.680]   Thanks Todd for the quarter ended June 30 2020 we reported a net loss of 7.5 million dollars
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:16.000]   compared with the net loss of 13.3 million dollars for the quarter ended June 30 2019
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.360]   net loss per share with 25 cents for the quarter ended June 30 2020 compared with 49 cents for
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:28.760]   the same period in 2019 losses have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:35.080]   and development programs as well as from general and administrative expenses research and
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.760]   development expenses were 4.9 million dollars for the quarter ended June 30 2020 compared
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:47.240]   with 10.7 million dollars for the same period in 2019 the decrease of 5.8 million dollars
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:53.440]   is primarily related to a reduction in clinical and pre clinical development manufacturing
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:59.600]   and personnel cost general and administrative expenses were 2.2 million dollars for the
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:06.680]   quarter ended June 30 2020 compared with 3.1 million dollars for the same period in 2019
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.680]   the decrease of nine hundred thousand dollars is due to lower personnel related costs including
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:18.160]   stock based compensation and other miscellaneous administrative costs in the second quarter
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.880]   of 2020 total operating expenses were 7.1 million dollars compared with total operating
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:33.240]   expenses of 13.7 million dollars for the same period in 2019 as of June 30 2020 cash cash
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:42.140]   equivalents and marketable securities were sixty six point two million dollars subsequent
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.400]   to June 30 2020 twenty five point two million dollars in cash was received from at the market
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:54.140]   offering program sales to perceptive advisors the video partners and other investors based
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:14:01.320]   on current operating plans cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30 2020
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:07.040]   plus the additional at the market offering program proceeds are expected to be sufficient
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:13.080]   to fund operation through the end of 2022 including potential NDA approvals for reproxel
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:19.000]   app and dry disease and allergic conjunctivitis assuming positive clinical trial results
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   and planned NDA submission acceptances and approvals use of cash cash equivalents and
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.560]   marketable securities are also expected to include the continuation of part one of the
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:37.400]   phase three guard trial in PVR and phase two clinical testing of ADX six two nine and orally
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:43.640]   administered rats inhibitor and inflammatory diseases now turn the call back to Todd for
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:55.560]   closing comments thanks Josh we have a number of milestones planned for the second half
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.680]   of 2020 and look forward to executing on our clinical development strategy across our
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:06.960]   ocular and systemic programs looking at our IR calendar next week we'll be presenting
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:13.600]   at the BTIG virtual biotechnology conference and wed bush pack row virtual healthcare

[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:43.280]   lives of patients with serious unmet medical needs with that Josh Dave and I will be happy
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.000]   to take your questions operator at this time if you would like to ask a question please
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.240]   press star then the number one on your telephone keypad that is star one to ask a question
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:59.860]   for the first question comes from the line of Louis and with cancer hi thanks for taking
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:06.040]   my questions here so first question I have for you is can you get into more detail significant
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:11.520]   the FDA's recognition of graft as assigned for dry eye disease is and what that means
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.920]   for you intense in terms of potential approval and market opportunity and then the second
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.680]   question I have for you was on your covert trials how adaptive are those trials in light
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:26.080]   of the constantly evolving landscape for the treatment of coven and then how enrollment
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.440]   gone and then my last question here is you noted that there's been some headwinds the
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.840]   clinical trial progression due to covid can you give more color on which trials may be
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:41.760]   impacted here thank you good morning Louise and thanks for your excellent questions the
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:51.600]   draft development is truly transformative for Aldera draft is the pharmaceutical target
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:17:00.200]   upon which the company was founded many years ago to our knowledge no company has ever therapeutically
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:08.160]   addressed draft and yet draft represents a very broad based anti-inflammatory approach
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.480]   that probably applies to many many diseases not only ocular diseases such as dry disease
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:23.100]   but also systemic diseases so for all those reasons we were thrilled about the FDA decision
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:29.440]   to classify rats as an objective sign of dry eye disease which as you know is an inflammatory
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:38.660]   condition what it means practically for the company is that the ongoing clinical trial
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.840]   the clinical trials that are about to start regarding the assessment of rats should be
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:50.240]   likely to work based on the fact that the mechanism of reproxylapin our other rest inhibitors
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:58.200]   is the direct inhibition of rats these compounds bind covalently to rats so what we're really
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:06.280]   measuring is a chemical reaction in vivo and in this case in the tear fluid of patients that
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:14.080]   have been administered reproxylapin all that leads us to believe that we'll be in a position to file
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:23.440]   an NDA for dry disease next year as we have previously announced regarding the covid trial
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:32.200]   design we anticipate for both programs enrolling approximately 30 patients I think they'll likely
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:39.320]   be a two-to-one randomization drug to placebo at this point we have not included adaptive
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:46.800]   designs I think the nature of the results of these first trials will help us determine
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.520]   subsequent clinical testing which is obviously going to be much more significant if there are
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:59.720]   positive results from the preliminary outputs that we have here enrollment hasn't started the
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:07.440]   IND has been filed for 629 as I mentioned on the call today 1612 is the subject of further
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:17.640]   in vivo investigation in covid that is being performed by nyad and we're absolutely thrilled
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:29.080]   about nyad's decision to test ADX 1612 on our behalf the covid impact as you mentioned Louise
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:36.120]   across the industry has been significant the one trial in our case in our pipeline that has been
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:45.800]   affected by covid 19 as the guard trial the phase three guard trial for PVR what seemed to have
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:55.400]   happened during the peak of covid cases back in March April May and so forth was that many
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:04.600]   patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite vision changes despite losing sight the
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:14.880]   number of patients coming in was diminished during that time frame and furthermore many clinical
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   sites as you know simply did not have research staff which were considered for a while to be
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:28.040]   non essential such that it was difficult if not impossible in some cases to enroll to enroll
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:34.480]   patients however the good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline we do not seem to
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:42.000]   be have been overtly affected by covid in terms of enrollment the dry eye program was largely
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:51.080]   under discussion with the FDA during the peak number of cases in the spring the allergy program
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:58.160]   the phase three allergy program was on a planned hold because of pollen as you know you cannot
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:04.960]   enroll allergy programs with ambient pollen and we expect the invigorate program to reinitiate
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.200]   again in the fall so we were quite fortunate in terms of timing with regard to our other clinical
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:22.080]   programs believe relative to the impact of of covid okay thank you as a reminder if you would
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.800]   like to ask a question please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad that
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.400]   is star one to ask a question your next question comes from the line of justin down with oppenheimer
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:39.360]   in company hi good morning guys thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress i know
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.000]   it's early days but you know as you think about establishing a process left action on rasp as
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.480]   a sign of dry eye we've had some discussion with the message on what would be an appropriate duration
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.880]   of observation to assess this activity can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.640]   the acute versus four-week time points from a trial perspective uh disease perspective and labeling
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:09.280]   perspective right good morning justin and good to hear from you the as i highlighted in my comment
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:15.440]   uh this morning the potential range of dosing duration for the rafts trials is anywhere from
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:22.720]   one to two days on the acute end to 28 days on the more chronic or sub chronic end which reflects
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.520]   the phase two a trial that is the data in our corporate decks showing that after 28 days of
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:34.080]   administration of reproxelab there was a highly statistically significant reduction in rafts levels
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:40.880]   as measured by eliza i want to spend a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:47.600]   rafts rafts exist in our body in two forms so-called free rafts that are rafts that are
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:54.480]   sort of floating around and then rafts that are bound to proteins the eliza measures rafts bound
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:02.720]   to proteins and as you know eliza is an antibody mediated uh detection assay the reason why we're
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.400]   able to generate antibodies to bound rafts is that when rafts bind to proteins they're antigens
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:16.880]   and uh form antibodies in some cases uh antibodies against self proteins so the eliza measures
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:23.200]   bound rafts and bound rafts generally accumulate over time which is why in the phase two a study
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:30.400]   over 28 days we use the eliza to assess rafts levels on the other end of the spectrum regarding
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:38.480]   one to two day or acute dosing of reproxelab we think that techniques such as lcms and aspect
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:44.400]   might be uh more relevant to assessing rafts because there we'd be looking at free rafts levels
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:52.480]   that would change acutely uh following dosing so somewhere within those two ranges of dosing
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:24:00.560]   paradigms and those two different assay techniques um we will end up validating the precise technique
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:08.560]   and and then establishing protocol design uh for the uh first of the rats studies to begin shortly
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:16.640]   okay great got it um and maybe then you know how do you think about dosing regiments to
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.200]   be investigated and have you had conversations with the fj on you know whether you'd have to do
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:27.120]   sort of you know q id or bid you know just to appreciate that you would be tapering and and
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:34.880]   sort of the uh disease state eventually right and and that gets back to the first part of your
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:41.440]   question how uh might the clinical community perceive a duration of dosing and dosing regiments
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:51.520]   first of all i think that uh signs of diseases including dry eye disease are primarily or
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:59.040]   first and foremost regulatory milestones i do not believe that certainly in the case of dry eye
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:06.160]   disease that either physicians or patients are particularly worried about signs patients do
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:12.720]   not wake up in the morning thinking i wonder what my shimmer test is i wonder what my corneal stain
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.960]   is and so forth uh instead we view signs and i think most patients and physicians use signs as
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:27.200]   regulatory um milestones so the dosing paradigm for trials associated purely with signs i think
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:34.160]   is a lot less important um in this case for one to two dose a day the one to two day dosing
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:41.120]   paradigm you're thinking of of a limited number of doses for the 28 day dosing paradigm i would
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:48.160]   expect we would dose q id which is the first phase of our induction maintenance uh dosing
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:54.880]   paradigm which was established with the release of the phase three renew trial uh back in uh
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:01.440]   december in terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm for reproxelab in general
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:08.160]   in terms of treating patients i think that uh the induction maintenance paradigm established
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:16.880]   with renew over 12 weeks uh really sets the tone and and more precisely the label for how the drug
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:24.480]   will be used and that is a q id dosing initially uh followed by b id dosing uh for the maintenance
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:31.440]   phase okay that's really helpful um maybe just a clarification question i i know in the press
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:38.240]   leaf it says that there's uh going to be a dry india filing um by the end of the next year
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.920]   is the current thinking still to continue on or with a concurrent filing just you know i know
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.000]   later it says that ac is also going to be found just wondering if the expectation is that you would
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.920]   expect them together still our current thinking is that both will be filed together pending
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:02.640]   positive clinical data of course uh it turns out that the timeline for dry eye disease and allergic
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:11.440]   conjunctivitis continue to overlap uh the safety studies the efficacy studies the timeline for filing
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:19.440]   the india all of those seem to overlap uh for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:26.720]   would suggest that a concurrent india is perhaps the best regulatory strategy but of course we'll
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   have to see how uh events play out um over the latter part of this year and the early part of
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:40.640]   next year before we can guide specifically on the uh possibility of a concurrent india we really do
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.720]   like the concurrent india paradigm however because of the overlap between dry eye disease
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.560]   and allergic conjunctivitis there seems to be about a 50 percent overlap such that about half
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.800]   of the patients with dry eye disease complain of ocular itching and about half the patients with
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:03.280]   allergic conjunctivitis complain of dryness and and a single compound that could treat both diseases
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:10.240]   or is indicated for both diseases would be highly advantageous not only to uh physicians but also
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:16.720]   to patients as well right great that makes a lot sense um my last question is just uh you know on
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.400]   the safety study is there an expectation for what the size and scope uh you know duration as well
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   number of patients you would you would anticipate for it right for dry eye disease um my current
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:39.920]   understanding is that the fda generally requires 100 patients complete one year of dosing uh
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:48.720]   however um uh based on other other uh sponsors interactions with the agency we believe that
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:56.880]   we can file based on six months of safety data so what happens is most sponsors will over enroll
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:04.640]   they'll begin with more than 100 patients such that they have 100 completers at um at 12 months
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:14.400]   and to our knowledge the the safety trials are are fairly standard in dry eye disease
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:23.280]   i will say as i mentioned in my prepared comments that we've tested well over a thousand patients
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:31.520]   we have seen no safety signals no changes in intraocular pressure no retinal findings
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:40.000]   no aberrant corneal findings uh or any other safety uh uh signals that would suggest that there
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.200]   has been an issue with reproc lap dosing in any patient that's received drugs so far
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:50.320]   great great thanks again and i'll hop back in the queue yep thanks jesse
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.080]   and there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to Dr
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:04.960]   Brady for closing remarks well thank you all again for joining us today uh as always we look
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:11.520]   forward to keeping you updated on our progress have a nice day thank you thank you ladies and

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   >> Good morning and welcome to Earthstone Energy Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.140]   At this time, while participants are in a listen-only mode,
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.720]   a brief question in the intercession will follow the formal presentation.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.080]   If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press Star 0
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.340]   on your telephone keypad.
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.160]   As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.960]   Joining us today from Earthstone are Robert Anderson, President and Chief Executive Officer,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.800]   Mark Lumpkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.780]   and Scott Philander, Vice President of Finance.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.600]   Mr. Philander, you may begin.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.760]   >> Thank you and welcome to our Second Quarter Conference Call.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.920]   Before we get started, I would like to remind you
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.880]   that today's call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.620]   of Section 27(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.020]   and Section 21(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.780]   Although management believes these statements are based on reasonable expectations,
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.300]   they can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.700]   These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.860]   as described in the earnings announcement we released yesterday
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.980]   and in our 2019 annual report on Form 10(k)
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.380]   and subsequent quarterly filings.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.660]   These documents can be found in the investor section of our website, www.herstoneenergy.com.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.060]   Should one or more of these risks materialize
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.020]   or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.700]   This conference call also includes references to certain non-gap financial measures
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.020]   which include adjusted diluted shares, adjusted EBITDAX, adjusted net income,
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.020]   all in cash costs, cash GNA and pre-cash flow.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.300]   Reconciliations of these non-gap financial measures
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   to the most directly comparable measure under GAP are contained
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.820]   in our earnings announcement released yesterday.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.900]   Also, please note information on this call speaks only as of today, August 6th, 2020.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.020]   Thus, any time sensitive information may no longer be accurate
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.260]   at the time of any replay or transcript reading.

[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.100]   on our earnings announcement released yesterday.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.460]   Today's call will begin with comments from Robert Anderson, our CEO,
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.300]   followed by remarks from our CFO, Mark Lumpkin,
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.580]   regarding financial measures and financial matters and performance,
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.260]   and then some closing comments from Robert.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.740]   I'll now turn the call over to Robert.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.980]   >> Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.260]   and appreciate everyone's attendance for our call today.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.780]   Thanks for making time to join us for our second quarter conference call.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.300]   In the midst of the current pandemic, we continue to take appropriate caution
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.420]   and maintain focus on keeping our personnel safe while continuing
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.340]   to efficiently manage our operations.
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.220]   Achieving our strong second quarter results in the face
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.980]   of this unprecedented oil price collapse
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.980]   and difficult operating environment is evidence
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.620]   of the resiliency of our business plan
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.180]   and the solid commitment of our people.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.900]   Throughout these trying times, we have worked to quickly adjust
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.660]   to the rapidly changing conditions and align our costs
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.380]   with our business activity as well as preserve our strengths.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.340]   As we have discussed last quarter and in updates along the way,
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.620]   stating we would be free cash flow positive
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.980]   from the second quarter on for 2020,
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.780]   we had significant free cash flow of $35 million in this quarter.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.380]   This was driven by several factors including limited capital expenditures
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.460]   in the quarter as we completed our drilling
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.180]   and completion program for the year, strong hedge position
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.940]   that delivered over $29 million of realizations
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.740]   and significantly lower operating costs,
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.700]   partially as a result of our May shut in and containment program
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.300]   but also sustainable reductions.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.820]   Including the impact of our shut in program,
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.140]   our average daily sales volume in the second quarter
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.580]   was 13,555 barrels of oil equivalent or BOE per day.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.660]   Even with reduced volumes and a 44% drop
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.660]   in average realized price per BOE in the second quarter,
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.620]   our cost management efforts combined with the strong hedge position
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.740]   allowed us to generate higher quarter over quarter adjusted net income
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.660]   and adjusted EBITACs.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.900]   I suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.420]   We expect to generate substantial free cash flow
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.100]   throughout the balance of the year
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.740]   which should result in a decreasing debt balance
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.700]   and help us achieve our target of being below one times debt to EBITACs for the year.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.140]   As we previously discussed in response to the sharp decline in oil prices in April
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.300]   and very low forecasted May oil prices,
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.180]   we made the decision in late April to shut in the large majority
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.060]   of our operated production for the month of May
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.260]   which resulted in approximately 60% of our total net production being shut in during May.
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.940]   With a forecast of significantly improved June oil prices
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.220]   which ultimately were more than double our April and May oil price realizations,
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.220]   we returned to full production in June.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.380]   We had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.020]   which saw us reduce total lease operating expense or LOE
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.820]   in the second quarter by 40% from the prior quarter.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.740]   Despite reduced production volumes due to our shut in program in May,
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.700]   our teams continued focused on cost reductions
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.220]   resulted in a 30% decrease in LOE per BOE in the second quarter
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.340]   to $4.53 versus $6.51 cents in the first quarter.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.940]   This was the major driver of the overall 33% reduction
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.460]   in all-in cash costs during the quarter.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:26.460]   On a per unit basis, our all-in cash costs went from near $13 per BOE in the first quarter
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.980]   to near $10 per BOE in the second quarter for a total 22% reduction.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.300]   This is all-in cash costs, folks, which includes operating costs, corporate GNA costs
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.380]   and all of our interest costs on our debt.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.500]   To dive a little deeper into how we achieve the 40% decrease in LOE,
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   let me outline some of the key factors.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.460]   First, as much of our peers have done,
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.020]   we were successful in negotiating price reductions
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.020]   with vendors across the broad range of our lease operating expenses
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:05.140]   from chemicals to maintenance rigs, saltwater disposal contracts and compression costs.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.540]   Second, we are benefiting from our long-term practice
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.940]   of spending a little more money as we go repairing wells, facilities and associated equipment
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.420]   to reduce frequency of maintenance,
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:23.860]   which is resulting in a continued decrease in non-routine LOE repair needs.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.380]   Third, workover repairs have trended down,
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.700]   resulting from our optimization of Lyft method, chemical program improvements
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.180]   and general approach of fixing things right the first time.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.380]   The limited offset frack activity also reduced frack hit related workover expenses.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.100]   Fourth, we have been successful in getting the utility companies
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.380]   to perform electrical upgrades sooner than scheduled
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   which has allowed us to eliminate generator usage on some of our newer locations.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.420]   Lastly, with limited drilling and completion activity,
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.620]   we have also been able to refocus our field employees towards lease maintenance
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.140]   which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.340]   All of these items and many other subtleties of operating were in progress
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.180]   as our team has a history of continually driving down costs.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.820]   We will remain focused on continuing to reduce costs across the board
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:23.900]   as we expect the oil price environment that we have observed since late 2014
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.100]   including increased volatility to persist
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.300]   which only stresses the need to structure our business
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.300]   to be profitable across a much lower oil price range.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.260]   I'd really like to commend our operations team
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.740]   which did a fantastic job of both shutting in production in May
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.980]   and bringing production back fully online in June
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.220]   while also achieving these cost reductions.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.980]   For the first time in my career and our team's history,
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.700]   we had to tell our guys to produce as little as possible every single day.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.820]   We executed this shut-in operations
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.100]   and our field personnel did a great job of efficiently returning wells to production
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.900]   with little to no incremental expense and no adverse effects on our producers.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.100]   Our wells have returned to their previous volumes
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.900]   with some wells producing at increased rates for a period of time.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.740]   Plus, the three wells in Southeast Reagan County
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.540]   that were brought online in April prior to the curtailment
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.540]   and were shut in during May are now back online
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.340]   and have fully cleaned up and are performing well versus the tide curve.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.020]   I mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in late May
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.740]   and released our contracted rig operating in the Midland Basin
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.460]   so our planned capital expenditures are minimal for the balance of the year
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.700]   given that our program ended with 11 wells drilled but not completed
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.060]   and with our ample liquidity we have optionality on completion timing
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.700]   depending on market conditions.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.340]   With production return to full capacity, we have entered the second half of this year
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.780]   with expectations for no further drilling or completion activity this year.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:07.660]   We can maintain approximately flat year-over-year production in 2020 compared to 2019.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.340]   As a reminder, we recently updated our 2020 full-year production guidance
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.540]   ranging from 13,000 to 14,000 BOE per day
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:23.260]   which compares the 2019 full-year average of 13,429 BOE per day.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.700]   Further, with our 11 drilled but uncompleted wells in Upton County
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.740]   we intend to carefully monitor commodity pricing, appropriate service availability
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.020]   and service cost conditions to determine if it makes sense
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.100]   to bring in a completion crew later this year or wait until early next year.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.140]   Depending on the timing, we anticipate the completion of those 11 wells
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:50.180]   would enable us to maintain similar year-over-year production for 2021
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.820]   with only a modest capital program for the completions
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.740]   which we currently estimate at around $30 million.
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.500]   With that overview, I'll now turn the call over to Mark to review the financials.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.620]   Have at it, Mark.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.940]   Thank you, Robert.
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.260]   As we have in the past two consecutive quarters
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.860]   I'd like to first discuss our cash position and our balance sheet.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.540]   As Robert mentioned, we are pleased to have achieved our goal
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.260]   of generating substantial free cash flow in the quarter
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.660]   with a total of $35.1 million free cash flow.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.740]   As we represent our first quarter call
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.700]   our plan was first to reduce our working capital deficit
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.300]   which we calculate excluding derivatives
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.380]   and we're able to do this by over $50 million during the second quarter
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.980]   and then to begin to pay down our revolver debt.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.860]   The bargain based under our Senior Secure Revolving Facility
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.700]   which was set in late March
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.860]   remains unchanged at $275 million
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.460]   and should remain there until our regularly scheduled fall
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.660]   redetermination process.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.500]   Our outstanding bar rings under the credit facility at Quarter End
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.220]   hold $168.6 million
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.060]   and we had $1.8 million in cash.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.500]   With $106.4 million of unused barring capacity
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.420]   that gave us approximately $108 million of liquidity at Quarter End.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.500]   I would note that as of July 31st
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.700]   we had paid down our revolver by $14.3 million compared to Quarter End
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.980]   reducing our debt balance now to about $154.3 million
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.620]   and we did expect to apply free cash flow
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.540]   the remainder of the year primarily to pay down the revolver.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.700]   During the second quarter our capital expenditures
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.300]   settled $3.2 million
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.020]   and year to date we have spent $45 million
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.100]   of our annual 2020 capital budget of $50 to $60 million.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.260]   As Robert mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in May
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.380]   so we anticipate minimal expenditures during the remainder of the year
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.820]   and will likely end up toward the low end of our guidance range.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.820]   Now looking at our second quarter income statement starting with the top line
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.900]   revenues for the second quarter of 2020 were $21.7 million
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.020]   compared to $45.1 million in the first quarter.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.900]   The decline was driven by a 54% decrease in oil revenues to $18.9 million
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.700]   which made up about 87% of total revenues
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.100]   and the NGL revenues fell by 44%
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.540]   while natural gas revenues rose slightly.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.500]   Our average price in the second quarter for all three commodities
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.500]   was $17.56 per barrel of oil equivalent
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.180]   which was down by nearly half of our average price during the first quarter.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.380]   By commodity our average realized price for crude oil in the second quarter
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:25.980]   was $23.56 per barrel natural gas at average 83 cents per MCF
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.900]   and NGL average $8.10 per barrel of oil equivalent.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.500]   From a production standpoint our second quarter sales volumes average
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.980]   13,555 barrels of oil equivalent per day
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.060]   which was comprised of 65% oil, 18% natural gas
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.780]   and 17% natural gas liquids.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.740]   As highlighted this does include having curtailed
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.620]   about 60% of total production in May.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.380]   On the expense side as Robert also highlighted we did drive down our all
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.140]   impact costs from $12.92 per BUE in the first quarter
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.660]   to $10.11 per BUE in the second quarter.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.780]   We achieved this through nearly $2 per BUE reduction
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:11.900]   our least operating expense to $4.52 per BUE for the quarter.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.420]   On the general administrative side we reduced our absolute cash
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.180]   GNA expense by about 7% versus the first quarter
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:25.500]   which resulted in per unit cash GNA expense of $3.34 per BUE.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.780]   As you know we reduced our cash GNA guidance in May to $15.5 to $16.5
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.620]   million for the full year and expect to be somewhere in that range
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:40.220]   which at the bottom end is a 25% reduction versus our initial full year plan.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.020]   In addition to some of the savings we articulated last quarter we
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.380]   continue to focus on and have had success in reducing expenses
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.860]   really anywhere including reduced uses of third party consultants
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.820]   reducing vendor rates and managing our costs tightly.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.540]   From an income standpoint we reported GAT net loss in the second quarter
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.140]   of $35.9 million or 55 cents per share
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.660]   which included a pre-taxed unrealized loss of 50 million dollars on our
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.660]   derivative contracts. Our adjusted net income was $12.8 million
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.540]   or 20 cents per guillotine share adjustable
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.740]   guillotine share for the second quarter. We reported adjusted EVA
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.940]   tax of $39.8 million in the second quarter which as Robert mentioned
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.820]   is actually an increased quarter of a quarter.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.180]   Now let's take a minute to update you on our commodity hedging results in the
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.940]   second quarter. As highlighted we realized $29.4 million
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.180]   gain on our commodity hedges for the quarter.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.300]   This is largely reflective of our hedge position entering the quarter and
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.340]   unlocking in some really nice gains on hedges when we made the decision to
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.860]   grieve production and did that when second quarter
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.500]   NYMAX prices were about up to the lowest point.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.180]   The hedge realizations also include a gain of about $5.7 million
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.500]   from an unwind of $1,000 barrels of oil a day for
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.020]   the second half of 2020. We remained really well
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.340]   ahead for the balance of the year with an average of 6,500 barrels per day of oil
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.900]   swapped at a NYMAX price of $58.35 stepping down to 4,000
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:09.180]   barrels a day for four year 2021 at a NYMAX price of $55 and 16 cents per
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.020]   barrel with basis hedges and places on similar volumes.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.340]   On the natural gas side we have 7,000 MMBTU per day
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.580]   of swaps at a Henry hub price of $2.85 for the
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.060]   second half of this year stepping up to 8,000 MMBTUs per day
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.860]   at a price of $2.71 for four year 2021
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.500]   with basis hedges in place on the same volumes.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.180]   Hedging remains a critical component of our financial strategy and we expect to
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.300]   continue layering on hedges as we get more visibility
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:45.500]   around the resumption of our drooling and completion activity going forward.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.620]   Stepping back and looking at our expectations for four year 2020
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.700]   we reinstated our production guidance in July and we've reinstated LOE and
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.220]   production and Avalorum tax guidance with our earnings released
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.500]   yesterday. Our reinstated production Avalorum tax
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.820]   guidance of 6.25 percent to 7.25 percent is
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.980]   identical to what it was at the onset of our 2020 guidance provided in January
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:13.260]   as is the case for our reinstated LOE guidance of $550 to $6 for BOE.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.500]   Although we have had recent sustainable LOE reductions and came in well below
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.180]   this range in the second quarter without the advantage of bringing on new wells
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.300]   we have kept our guidance range where it was at the end of the year when we
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.620]   anticipated bringing 16 new wells online. With that I'll turn it back over to Robert.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.980]   Thank you Mark. We are really pleased with the results
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.300]   and confident in a bright future for Erstown. While we are sorry to see our
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.980]   industry in such distress it is creating more M&A
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.340]   opportunities than we have seen in quite some time.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.460]   We're actively evaluating a number of situations
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.820]   and expect to have more to consider throughout the rest of the year
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.380]   as prices remain low and distress situations continue to increase.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.060]   We believe that our strong balance sheet and track record as a successful
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.060]   consolidator positions us well to increase the scale of our company
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.780]   and add value to our shareholders. With that operator we'll now open the floor
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.460]   for questions. Thank you. At this time we'll
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.900]   be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:18.060]   please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.980]   your line is in the question queue. You may press star 2 if you'd like to
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.500]   remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.620]   it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.820]   keys. Our first question comes from the line
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:37.580]   of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.340]   Hi morning everyone hope you're doing well. I guess from the
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.700]   the 2021 call that you gave about being able to keep production flat
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.220]   with the 11 ducks is that more just meant to be
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.660]   instructive or is that actually how you're thinking about the 2021 plan
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.620]   as we fit here today?
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:05.500]   Yes a little bit of both Brad. You know it does depend on where commodity prices
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.740]   head towards the end of the year whether we want to pick up a rig or not.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.900]   I think we've been pretty vocal or consistent about our message that you
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.900]   know we need we need mid 45 to 50 dollar oil
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.620]   to want to go back to spending large capital dollars
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.980]   but outside of that at some point into this year early next year completing
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:34.060]   those wells will allow us to main production flat year over year.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:40.540]   Okay good and then obviously you made the comment on M&A can you go into a little
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.660]   more detail about sort of what opportunities you're seeing and
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.140]   also any thoughts you have about an ability to fund them?
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:58.940]   The opportunities are increasing and size is variable from small to
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.860]   quite large as you've seen you know distressed and bankrupt
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:10.460]   companies I think all of this will result in further opportunities in terms
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:17.740]   of larger company selling assets it is difficult with no
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.020]   public equity and for that matter debt markets
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:27.420]   open or open only to a very few maybe we're one of those few but we've had
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.660]   discussions with financial parties who are interested in participating with us
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.900]   on acquisitions and much like we've done in our
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.180]   history you know we'll bring in parties at the right time to
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.900]   look at buying assets and we're going to maintain a
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:51.020]   very healthy leverage amount and keep ourselves from getting into a
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.100]   distress no matter where we are in the cycle so
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.620]   I think we're just going to see more and more opportunities and
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.300]   we'll figure out how we can finance those and make sure we keep our balance
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:08.380]   sheet clean okay thanks for the comment
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.580]   thank you our next question comes in line of Neil Dingman with true security
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.420]   please proceed with your question morning all Robert
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.500]   first question also on that same line on 21 expectations I'm just wondering
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.780]   you know why I realized this plan really I think you know at least the ones you've
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.780]   just initial laid out as soon as no new wells really what's what I'm just
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.100]   wondering what's driving this low cost or another way maybe ask is how you
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.980]   think about maintenance capex you know given just
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.140]   solo because um you know if I recall I thought Frank already had you all cancel
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.020]   those country club and other memberships I just know what else is there
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:49.420]   uh yes there's no country club memberships up here
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:55.740]   um you know I mean the 11 wells we have
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:01.100]   are in really good areas and they uh they will help us keep production
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.900]   relatively flat at 30 million dollars now is that sustainable
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.540]   absolutely not um you know we still have a relatively high decline rate
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.980]   and it does depend on when we brought those wells online if we waited till the
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.420]   very end of 21 we're going to have a hard time
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:23.820]   keeping production relatively flat if we brought them on today you know we might
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.860]   have the same problem because we get all this flush production from these new
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:33.020]   wells so um you know maintenance to maintain
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.780]   you know 13 thousand BOE a day kind of level
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.300]   longer term we're going to have to have a rig running and
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.860]   a one rig program I don't know what it would exactly cost us today but
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.100]   generally speaking is 120 million to maybe 140 million
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.180]   depending on lateral length and working interest and things like that so
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.260]   you know this is just a very preliminary if the world stays the same and we're at
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:02.060]   40ish low 40 dollar environment we're not spending any drilling capital
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:07.180]   um these 11 ducks will help us keep production flat
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.020]   okay and then you kind of hit on my last one just on
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.340]   how do you think about the sort of PDP decline you know
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.420]   on a go forward it is now that you've been slowing a bit is that
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:24.460]   that too you know going to go down or I mean I guess we'll get another way is
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.100]   it you know you're able to give us kind of how many how many wells would offset
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.100]   that I mean in any way you can kind of give us a
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.860]   color on how you know kind of you're thinking about that in 21 on broader
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:41.580]   terms yeah I think we've been consistent in telling
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:47.020]   everyone that our sort of basic line starting today we'll call it you know
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:53.180]   is about 30 percent in the first year and then it gets into the mid maybe 26
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:58.540]   or 27 percent the next year and then low 20s or high teens after that
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:04.940]   and so you know I don't think that's changed any uh and if we didn't spend
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.380]   any capital then you can kind of forecast what our
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.780]   low down um production would look like
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.300]   even if we didn't do those 11 wells but again with those 11 wells
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.820]   it'll help keep 21 flat and then going forward in 22 and beyond it's all
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.660]   going to depend on price very good thanks
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:31.260]   thank you our next question comes from line of
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:36.300]   Jeff Grant with Northland Capital Markets please proceed with your question
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:42.540]   I guess um was wondering uh Robert or maybe Mark how important do you guys
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.260]   do you think precast flow positive in the context of evaluating um you know
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.860]   whether to go after this adduction and potentially drilling or I guess some
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.700]   point in time but would you view that as kind of a
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.700]   you know a must if you will or would you guys have any level of comfort with any
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.540]   you know near medium term outstanding um it could help you know if the returns
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:07.420]   were good and it would help kind of you know jump start a return to growth
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.900]   sure maybe I'll try to answer that one then Robert can add on if he wants to
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.740]   you know we keep things pretty simple at the end of the day
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.900]   we feel like our responsibility is to make good individual decisions at the
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.020]   wellhead um and that's why we were quick to
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.740]   to put the rig down and stop completing in March and April
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.780]   is because the economics didn't make a whole lot of sense then
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.980]   did the ducks make sense right now I mean economically you definitely could go
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.660]   complete the ducks right now and uh have pretty nice uh
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.140]   IRR's for the incremental cost to complete them um
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:47.100]   in terms of are we so focused on quarter to quarter year to year precast
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:52.860]   precast flow that we won't outspend no we're not and from a practical matter
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.540]   and we're just going to be precast positive this year and next year
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.380]   kind of irrespective of anything else that happens with prices if all we're
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.820]   doing is completing the ducks um at some point
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.580]   you know we we do anticipate picking the rig back up and
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.780]   you know there's a bit of a obviously a lag there between
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.580]   the cost you expend to drill in the complete wells
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.580]   versus the cash flow you know does that mean over the course of the year we're
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.940]   not precast positive no not necessarily um
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.940]   but we're not so fixated on checking that box
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:29.340]   every quarter we want to make smart economic decisions the wellhead
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:33.180]   that will flow into the bigger picture uh and having some outspent for some
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.020]   period of time um yeah we still think is supported by
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.940]   the economics uh at the same time you know we're
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.900]   we're not ones just to go keep drilling and completing because we have hedges
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.820]   in place or for other reasons we're just trying to
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.620]   to be as good as we can of the individual decisions we're making
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.700]   at the wellhead yeah the only thing i'll add jeff is i think
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.020]   we can run a one rig program with the level of production and cash flow we
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.020]   have today and be cash flow neutral on
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.380]   an annualized basis yeah obviously there's a
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.580]   jump starting the program we're going to be cash flow negative for
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.380]   a period of time but i think longer term over a year time frame
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.700]   uh again depending on what the price is
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.780]   sure understood appreciate those comments and my follow-up um
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.140]   and you guys still have um you know a decent amount of non-off
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.820]   exposure uh in the permean are you guys seeing any
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.660]   activity levels there and more on the land side
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.100]   is there any traction or conversations uh on swapping
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.820]   any of that out to increase the operation exposure there
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.020]   still working on the trades uh but people have been hunkered down in the
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.700]   bunker you know for quite some time now
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.020]   since you know at least march um and so nothing's
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:02.540]   moving very quickly there uh we have no we have not heard anything
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.860]   different from our partners in terms of activity
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.100]   in the near term uh being kind of the remainder of this year so we'll have to
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.860]   see as we get closer to year-end what their view might be for
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.380]   activity in 2021
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.820]   all right thank you
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:26.380]   thank you our next question comes from line of donkin my kintosh
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.900]   with donton rey please receive your question
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:35.340]   morning robert um morning check i had a quick question over
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.140]   on the balance sheet you know y'all are doing a great job in the free cash out
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.500]   looks great paying it down wondering you know if you've been in conversations
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.100]   with the bank as we head into the fall redetermination
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.740]   back in march you know we're early and getting it done
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.980]   in the spring but you know um back in back then it looked like things would be
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.100]   pretty dire again in the fall and and it's not as bad here and particularly
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.140]   with the line of sight y'all have on the free cash kind of how
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.140]   any conversations with them to give you any indication as to what uh the fall
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:07.980]   redetermination could could look like sure i mean probably too early to
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.740]   you know certainly anything around numbers uh but we do pretty rarely talk
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.620]   to banks and we do that normal course irrespective of the
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.940]   environment um you know the one thing i can for us we
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.220]   are expecting a decrease in the bar base and you know obviously we're not
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:26.780]   drilling and completing new wells and hedges roll off um you know fortunately
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.700]   and we feel like we've got enough ability to pay down debt to outpace
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.420]   that decrease and and really you know we don't see any scenarios
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.740]   that we think are realistic that would be concerning in that regard
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.940]   now i will say like does the environment feel better
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:48.220]   now than it did three months ago absolutely uh and and maybe some of
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:53.340]   that's the shock of seeing minus 37 hour oil and uh you know
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.100]   teen realizations for for the months of April and May
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.500]   um at the end of the day it's still not a very good price environment for
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.900]   for companies in general and the banks um
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:11.580]   maybe they feel a little better because we're at $45 or $42 versus
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.980]   somewhere in the teens but they still have a lot of issues to deal through
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.900]   to deal with and obviously there's been a lot of EMP companies that have gone
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.140]   bankrupt and there's certainly more that will so the banks
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.340]   still have their hands full and they're still working through all these
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.540]   situations yeah i think there is a lot of trepidation
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:35.900]   the banks part in general um and yeah i don't frankly see them
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.620]   letting up a whole bunch in the fall no that being said that's a general
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:46.380]   statement um yeah we've got one time leverage and liquidity and
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.740]   generally are viewed as having done the right thing from a
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:54.780]   financial standpoint and and our assets are better than than many
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:59.500]   we probably feel like we've got a pretty supportive bank group that um
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.260]   is going to be reasonable and fair and
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:09.260]   historically that's been the case um but too early to circle a number
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.780]   thanks mark um and then i guess just for my follow-up
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.220]   you know robby you gave some some really good color on and you all did some
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.980]   pretty creative things to get loe down um in the second quarter
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.780]   i know you talked about how it's going to come back up a little bit here in
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.220]   the back half of the year towards you know a more historical range but
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.340]   you know any of those uh initiatives that you took do you think that you could
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.820]   can carry forward to kind of help mitigate that
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:39.660]   loe creep uh definitely done there there's you know it's just a constant
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:45.180]   progression of a well's life cycle to adjust uh artificial
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:50.700]   lift a lot of our wells are on gas lift so relatively
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.780]   expensive compressors uh over time that gets
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.580]   changed out to other lift methods in some cases rod pump in other cases plunder
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.660]   lift um what have you so um we're continuing to
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:08.300]   work through that and that will definitely help reduce loe
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.980]   and then some of the things that you know we we uh we're fortunate in getting
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.060]   done in the quarter uh working with the utility company
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:19.660]   to get meters set and get ahead of the schedule there
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.020]   or got moved up in the schedule from some good
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.780]   relationships we uh we ended up getting generators
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.460]   off of our payroll and those are very very expenses though
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.740]   we didn't have a whole lot but they still show up as a big expense so
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:37.980]   some of these things we did in the second quarter uh are sustainable and
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.340]   we'll continue doing the right things in the way we you know operate our
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:46.700]   business and continue to watch costs like a hawk
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.380]   all right thank y'all very much and uh congratulations strong quarter and a
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:55.340]   strong outlook. Thank you, thanks Dan.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.220]   Thank you ladies and gentlemen as a reminder if you'd like to join the
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:02.140]   question queue please press star one on your telephone keypad our next
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.580]   question comes from the line of Noel Parks with Cokor and Palmer please
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:11.180]   proceed with your question. Hey good morning
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:15.980]   I know I um you know I was thinking about
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.140]   having the the back inventory that you know where it works out that
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.900]   you know just completing those uh next year gaming can help you keep
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.900]   production flat that's you know that's uh a lot of
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:32.460]   really great flexibility you have there and and I mean was that
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:39.500]   just sort of uh um a result of the the timing of everything
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.100]   you know kind of falling off the rails with with covid and
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:48.300]   overt Russia or or was um was that the sort of part of the
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.940]   plan as you were just trying to you know continue to pivot to
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:58.060]   to emphasis on free cash flow hitting it next year
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.380]   I'd love to tell you know all that we have this great plan
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.860]   that no matter what happened in the world oil going to 20 or sub 20
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.220]   that we could keep production flat for three years
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.620]   running with various amounts of capital if you go back and think about the
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.460]   beginning of the year and the call we had uh you know
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.980]   related to the fourth quarter earnings and full year
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.140]   um we had a one-rake program we were going to
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:30.540]   average for the entire year a tiny bit of free cash flow
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.140]   um and those 11 wells would have been completed
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.500]   I don't know if by now I can't remember but pretty darn close
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:42.620]   so um I'd say it's a fallout of what's happened here
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:49.740]   and just being very conservative with our capital expenditures and cash
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.420]   and making sure that you know we come out of this
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:59.740]   down this near-term down cycle we've been in a down cycle since 2014
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.300]   but at least this recent piece of it uh that we you know we survive
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.060]   nicely through it and come out the other side and um
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:13.180]   continue to find ways to consolidate and grow
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.180]   great thanks and you know just a housekeeping question
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.940]   sorry if you touched on this earlier and I missed it
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:26.140]   um for the free cash flow calculation if I looked at the numbers right it looked
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.860]   like this is one of those periods where there was a
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:33.900]   pretty big delta between I guess you'd say cash capex and
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:38.700]   you know uh sort of capex incurred in the quarter and
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.260]   I was just wondering um for the the free cash flow calculation
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:48.380]   going forward um there's just kind of which
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:53.260]   which which one of those is is more important for us to use as we um
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:57.020]   you know just try to model that
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:02.460]   we always use accrued cash from a calculation standpoint because not
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.500]   all the bills necessarily have hit but we know what
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:11.900]   generally they are so okay it's in that presentation on the last page or
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:17.980]   something like that okay so so oh and um one other thing
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.940]   I am and I just don't have a release in front of me
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:26.380]   and as far as changing working capital you that's something also you would
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:31.260]   routinely um include well include the impact of
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:36.620]   in a free cash calculation or would you exclude that
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.820]   yeah so we don't include that in a recognize there's
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:44.060]   you know multiple different ways to to look at that I mean the way
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.900]   we've been approaching it is okay adjusted EBIT Act is the the best proxy
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.580]   for you know really sort of cash flow for the period
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.100]   we back out interest expense and then we back out
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.860]   capital expenditures for activity during that period now
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.020]   when you're stopping or starting there is going to be a bigger delta
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.460]   between right calculate and pre-cash flow the way we do
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.700]   versus if you're using a cash cash back number
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:15.500]   you know the the second quarter was very typical from the standpoint of
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.340]   yeah here we're reporting 35 million of a free cash flow
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:24.620]   yeah our debt balance went up um and the the reason for that is because
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.500]   and of course this is tied to the cash cash back it's just the time of the
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.780]   payments you know we reduced the the negative
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.980]   working capital the working capital deficit by about 50 million during the
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.020]   quarter now we're to a point where that working
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.820]   deficit work capital deficit is pretty low and probably won't fluctuate a whole
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.780]   bunch one way or the other until we pick activity back up
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.460]   at which point you'd expect uh yeah as you start
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:54.380]   completions and drilling again you start getting bills but there's some lag
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.260]   between the activity and when you get the bills and when you pay them
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.740]   um so very typical quarter yeah as we mentioned the press release
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.340]   you know we had about 169 million of debt at quarter end
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.860]   and the month of july we we pay down a little more than 14
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.540]   um that's not the the run rate by the way it's not 14 million quarter
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.140]   that was high because of timing but we do expect um
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.340]   I mean really every month this year that we're paying down some debt
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:23.020]   um without any big changes in the working capital
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:29.740]   status great I thought for the details that thought for me
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.500]   thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:38.300]   session I'll turn the floor back to mr. Anderson for any final comments
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.540]   well we appreciate everybody uh joining us and uh you know we'll uh continue
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.740]   the update as uh as we need to and we'll see you
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.900]   next quarter thanks thank you this concludes today's
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.540]   conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your

[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.480]   Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.680]   Business Update Call. Today we have some updates to share with you on our operational progress
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.920]   as well as on our financial results. While we're still in the middle of a
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.360]   serious global health pandemic and a challenging economic downturn and aftermath, we are quite
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.440]   confident that the steps we're taking in advancing our science and moving our pipeline forward
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.000]   are beginning to yield data that demonstrate the long-term potential of our innovative approaches
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.120]   and products. COVID-19 continues to affect societies around the world and we hope that
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.800]   you and your families are well and safe. We are observing some impact by COVID-19 on the progress
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.560]   of our clinical studies. However, it's at last time we're taking great efforts to minimize them.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.960]   As a result, we have been able to continue our progress on the clinical studies of AFM 13
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:46.560]   in peripheral T cell lymphoma and of AFM 24 in each AFR positive tumors and which is very exciting
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:57.600]   for us. Genetic dose, the first patient with RO729709, which as you remember is the BCMA CT-168
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:06.960]   Inertial Engager. We're also making good progress on our pre-clinical pipeline. For our lead candidate AFM 13,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.520]   our study in patients who have relapsed or refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma and exhausted
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.080]   available standard of care treatments are now being treated with AFM 13 as a single agent.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.760]   We are executing according to our development timelines and, as previously stated, expect
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.240]   to complete the pre-determined interim analysis in mid 2021. We're also looking at options to
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.800]   enhance AFM 13's efficacy beyond monotherapy. The first of these options is the combination with
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.680]   allergenic and K cells in a study that is conducted at the MD Anderson cancer institute and on IST.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.080]   MD Anderson website now shows that the study is enrolling, but the initiation is impacted by
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.880]   the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Texas. A first patient in the study is expected as soon as this
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   situation improves. For AFM 24, we disclosed that we have completed the first cohort
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:19.280]   of our dose escalation study without any dose limiting toxicities and we're currently recruiting
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.200]   into the second dose cohort. We have all four planned sites active and recruiting.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.560]   Following the completion of the dose escalation phase of the study, we have the option to enroll
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.200]   patients into tumor specific expansion cohorts where we will look for single agent activity
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.920]   in a number of well defined tumor types. In addition, we're planning to initiate combination
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.080]   studies with checkpoint inhibitors and we will be providing updates as the program continues
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.640]   to make progress. We're very pleased with the continued progress in our collaboration with
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.520]   Genentech. Importantly, the phase one clinical study with the BCMA CT16A inhibitor ligature
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.320]   is now enrolling patients. This achievement represents the third inhibitor ligature to enter
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   the clinic and triggers a milestone payment to us during the third quarter in an amount that
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:24.560]   we're not able to disclose. Last month, Angus Smith joined us as Chief Financial Officer. Angus will
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.360]   introduce himself later and discuss our financial position and the flexibility provides us to
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.160]   continue to execute on our strategy and drive future growth of our company. During the annual
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:45.520]   January meeting of shareholders, which was held in August 4, we're happy to report that all proposed
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.480]   agenda items were approved. This includes the addition of Dr. Annalisa Jenkins and Harry Welten
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.600]   to the supervisor report as new members. Annalisa is a visionary leader who knows how to translate
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.000]   signs from bench to bedside and Harry is an accomplished financial executive who will help
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.920]   drive value creating strategies for the company. These additions to the supervisor report further
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:20.000]   strengthen the company's industry knowhow, experience and diversity. As it has only been
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.480]   a month and a half since we last spoke to you, we thought we would focus today's discussion
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.560]   on company achievements thus far and what gives us confidence in our science. Update you on our
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.400]   programs and allow plenty of time for Q&A. To get it, I will now hand over the call to
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.520]   Andreas Hastrik, our Chief Medical Officer, to give you a brief update on our clinical
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:50.960]   stage programs. Andreas? Thank you, Adi, for the introduction and thank you all for joining
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:58.720]   us today and I'm happy to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs that we
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:06.800]   made over the last three months. As you all aware, COVID-19 pandemic is still present globally
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:13.600]   and it continues to pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment of
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:22.000]   patients. The two guiding principles we are employing at AFIMED is to ensure patient safety
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.600]   on the studies and to ensure trial data integrity and this is in line, I think, with our guidances
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:36.400]   given from all competent authorities. Within this framework, however, the AFIMED team is very
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:44.800]   proactively working with all of our participating sites to make sure that our innovative treatment
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:52.640]   is still available for patients in need of new therapeutics and that we minimize the impact
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:09:00.080]   of COVID-19 to a minimum possible. One important achievement in this regard is that we were able
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.480]   to secure drug supply for all of our ongoing studies and can ensure uninterrupted treatment
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:15.200]   of all patients. To go into more detail, let's start with AFM13, our most advanced program first.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:26.400]   As you know, AFM13 is in a registration directed phase two study AFM13202 treating patients with
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:33.200]   relapsed and refractory peripheral T cell lymphomas who have exhausted all available
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.880]   standard of care options. The enrollment into this study is at a steady state.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:49.200]   We were able to activate 54 sites now contributing patients in 10 countries around the globe.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:59.440]   As you know, this study has Simon II stage design with a pre-planned interim analysis
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:07.760]   after 40 patients in the PTCL cohorts and as Adi said, we are confident that we will have the
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:14.960]   data from this interim analysis available by the middle of next year. There was also a third
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.960]   cohort or there is a third cohort in this study for patients with transformed mucosis
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:27.600]   fungoidis, so a cutaneous form of T cell lymphomas. This third cohort with mucosis
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.920]   fungoidis was never part and never intended to be part of the registration program. It was a proof
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:41.920]   of concept cohort only and for COVID-19 related restrictions, the enrollment into this cohort
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.800]   is currently on hold. As Adi also mentioned, we are continuing to make progress in our
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:57.120]   collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center where we have an active IND for our first phase one study
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:06.720]   of AFM 13 in combination with allergenic national killer cells. As Adi said, the current status
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:14.240]   at the MD Anderson webpage is recruiting and we know that patients are currently screened and
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:21.360]   considered and we are expecting to the enrollment of the first patient as soon as COVID-19 related
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:30.080]   restrictions at MD Anderson are lift up. Now let's move to our second program AFM 24.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:37.840]   As you know, by specific tetravalent molecule targeting both CD16A to activate
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.200]   national killer cells and macrophages and the EGF receptor on solid tumors.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:53.520]   This compound is in a phase one dose escalation part of the 101 study and we are happy to report
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:00.160]   that we were able to activate all four preplanned sites and all four preplanned sites are contributing
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:06.640]   patients. As we disclosed earlier, we have completed cohort one without observing dose
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:17.600]   limiting toxicities and are actively recruiting into dose cohort two. With this,
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:24.960]   I close the overview of the clinical progress and I'm happy to hand over to my colleague
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:31.760]   Arnchotelius chief scientific officer who will review with you some of our preclinical data that
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:38.080]   make us so excited about the opportunities that we can create for patients with ICE
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.080]   and activating the innate immune system. Arnch, please.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:50.800]   Thank you Andreas and thank you all for joining. In the next few minutes I would like to
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:57.040]   summarize as Andreas mentioned the preclinical and clinical data observed so far with our innate
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:05.280]   cell engagers providing evidence that these molecules are potent and safe drug candidates.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:14.800]   I'll start by summarizing the data showing that our ICEs are potent molecules. As you see on slide
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:24.720]   five, if we take AFM 13 as an example AFM 13 has been shown strong single agent anti-tumor responses
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:33.440]   and T cell lymphoma with an overall response rate of 50%. The molecule has also shown promising signs
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:40.960]   of broad clinical development potential in augmenting other IO therapies such as PD1 inhibitors.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:47.600]   For example, in the Hodgkin lymphoma phase one B study we've seen an impressive overall
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:57.840]   response rate of 88% with a complete response rate of 42 and 46% in the local and the central
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:04.480]   read respectively. In the low part of the slide we've also highlighted for you presentations
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:13.040]   of the studies past and in the future. Additionally our own experience and the work
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:20.560]   with Andy Anderson we have seen promising preclinical data showing that the combination
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.080]   with the adoptive transfer of NK cells enhanced the immune response of AFM 13
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:33.200]   leading to prolonged survival in the respective mouse model and as we mentioned the phase one
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:43.280]   B study and the Anderson is now in the last stages of preparation. If we go to slide six, you see
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:51.600]   that in our preclinical studies with AFM 24 we saw potent killing of EGFR positive tumor cell lines
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:15:00.160]   mediated by two distinctive mechanisms of action. Potent ADCC or antibody dependent
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:06.720]   cellular cytotoxicity is seen irrespective of the mutational status of the tumor cells
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:15.600]   and we see potent killing mediated by ADCP or antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:25.360]   in tumor cells with high and low EGFR expression. Importantly in cells bearing the KRAS G13D
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:33.440]   mutation AFM 24 shows preserved killing, potent killing for ADCP or phagocytosis
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:45.200]   whereas this ability is lost for established treatments for the anti-BCMA CD16 or RO729
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:52.640]   formerly known as AFM 26 molecule. We also saw very good potency in synomunkies
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.400]   whereas a dose dependent killing of BCMA positive plasma cells
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:07.760]   was observed. We believe that the observed improved potency is mediated by the dual
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:15.120]   mode of action of our approach. The innate cell engagers are employing NK cells and macrophages
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.640]   to kill tumor cells and thus act via a two-pronged mode of action
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:28.800]   of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody dependent phagocytosis to fight cancer
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:35.600]   indeed this dual mode of action is differentiated from other innate cell targeted approaches
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:45.840]   as these specifically activate NK cells only. Our innate cell engagers work at low expression
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:54.080]   levels. The potency is thus independent of the surface target expression and you see this
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:01.200]   we continue in slide six with AFM 13 we learned that there is a broad range of cell lines
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:08.400]   that express different levels of tumor antigen and we have not observed any dependency of target
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:16.880]   expression to the potency of the molecule. The same holds true for AFM 24 and the anti-BCMA
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:24.400]   engagers. Preclinically both molecules have shown high potency across a wide range of EGFR
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:32.800]   and BCMA surface expression including at low target expression levels. This implies that
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:39.280]   more patients could respond to treatment with an innate cell engager versus an antibody drug
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:48.400]   conjugate or ADC as the mechanism of ADCs have been shown only to rely on certain levels
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:55.120]   of target antigen thereby missing those tumor cells with expression levels below the ability
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:05.600]   of the ADC to bind two target cells. As we move on to slide seven and report on the safety front
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:13.440]   preclinically our innate cell engagers demonstrate low cytokine release. Some examples
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:19.680]   of this are the IND enabling toxicology study in cinemologous monkeys which consistently
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:27.200]   showed no meaningful increases in serum cytokines. For example at the June virtual ACR
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:34.320]   conference a preclinical poster presentation on the RO729 molecule with genetic showed potent
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:41.120]   cell killing in tumor cell lines employing NK cells as effector cells with minimal increase
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:49.200]   in cytokines. Also a four-week safety study in cinemonkeys showed a favorable safety profile
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:58.160]   with no cytokine release or adverse findings at the 1515 and 50 so 50 mixed per kick tested dose
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:07.520]   levels. And in the case of AFN24 only a transient increase in RO6 was observed that was fully
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:14.880]   reversible within 24 hours but no signs of cytokine release was observed that would lead
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:22.720]   one to believe that there is a risk of a cytokine storm in patients. Important to note here is that
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:29.760]   none of the clinical studies of AFN13 have revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:36.000]   These data indicate that our ICs have a tolerable and good safety profile.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.480]   Taken altogether these data suggest that our innate cell engagers are potent, able to engage
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:51.600]   at low levels of antigen expression and have thus far demonstrated a good and tolerable safety
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:59.280]   profile. Now in order to maximize the opportunity for molecules in addition to clinical development
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.760]   as monotherapies we're also pursuing combinations with natural killer cells and other treatments
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:13.920]   such as checkpoint inhibitors such as PD1 and PDL1. We go to slide 8 and first let me comment
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:20.880]   on our combination approach with NK cells. As you see on the slide there is evidence showing
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:27.920]   that high NK cell numbers are associated with better outcomes. For example patients with
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:34.960]   metastatic cutaneous melanoma have improved survival rates if their tumors show evidence
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:42.400]   of NK cell infiltration. We also know that patients with diffuse large B cell and follicular
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:52.560]   lymphomas treated with NDCD20 antibodies that have low peripheral NK counts tend to have poor
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:21:00.320]   survival. We are seeing that one of the limitations in treating patients is that they don't have
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:09.680]   the appropriate amount of NK cells. So we're working on supplementing NK cells through adoptive
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:18.240]   transfer and are currently assessing different approaches as you can see on slide 9. As we go
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:26.960]   to slide 10 and as discussed earlier the improved tumor cell killing by loading NK cells with our
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.440]   ICEs as you see on the graph for in vitro data on the right hand side of slide 10.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:40.800]   It will be investigated in the MD Anderson phase 1 study in CD30 positive recurrent or
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.160]   refractory Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The preclinical data that we share here and have
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.560]   shared before leads us to believe that we can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:04.880]   of innate cell engager AFM13 through the addition of NK cells and encouraged by the synergistic
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:13.520]   potential of combining our ICEs with NK cells and checkpoint inhibitors we're currently evaluating
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:19.520]   the opportunity on our developing clinical plans for these combinations with AFM24.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:28.880]   Finally let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at ASER. As a reminder our AFM24
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:37.760]   poster demonstrated its distinct mechanism of action different from other EDFR signaling inhibition
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:46.320]   approaches potentially able to provide benefit to a broad range of cancer patients and in the
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:54.880]   case of the joint poster with genetic the preclinical pharmacology and safety of the BCMA CD60NA
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:00.720]   innate cell engager shows potent cell killing in tumor cell lines employing NK cells as
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:07.760]   effector cells minimal increase in cytokines suggesting a low risk of cytokine release syndrome.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:15.360]   We hope this background was helpful for you and I will now turn the call over to Angus
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.160]   to introduce himself and provide an update on the financials thanks.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:27.520]   Thank you Angus. Thank you Angus. Before I discuss our financial highlights let me just say that
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.000]   I am thrilled to be going down to bed and not going down and I look forward to working
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.360]   with our talent team to deliver on the promise of our exciting site.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:42.800]   Turning to the results for the quarter api med consolidated financial statements have been
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.920]   prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the international accounting standard
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:54.960]   board for IASB. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros which is the
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:01.200]   company's functional and presentation currency therefore all financial numbers that I will
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:08.080]   present in this call unless otherwise noted will be in euros. We ended the second quarter
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:15.840]   with cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets of 92.6 million euros compared to 104.1
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:23.120]   million euros on December 31st 2019. During the quarter we received net proceeds of approximately
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:30.560]   20.8 million euros under our asset market for ATM program. Based on our current operating plan
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:36.800]   and assumptions we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:43.600]   will support operations into the first half of 2022. Net cash used in operating activities for
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:50.560]   the quarter ended June 30th 2020 was 15 million euros compared to 5.6 million euros in the second
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:57.600]   quarter of 2019. The second quarter 2019 net cash used in operating activities included a milestone
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:04.560]   payment to the company from the German Tech Collaboration. Total revenue for the second quarter
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:10.400]   of 2020 was 2.9 million euros compared with 4 million euros in the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:17.280]   Revenue in 2020 and 2019 predominantly relates to the Genentech Collaboration. Revenue from
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.080]   the Genentech Collaboration in the second quarter 2020 was comprised of revenue recognized for
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:29.200]   collaborative research services performed during the quarter. R&D expenses for the second quarter
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:36.000]   of 2020 were 11.7 million euros compared to 11.5 million euros in the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.040]   Expenses in 2020 relate predominantly to our AFM 13 and AFM 24 clinical programs
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.320]   as well as to our early stage development and discovery activities.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:54.240]   G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 2.6 million euros compared to 2.3 million euros
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:01.120]   in the second quarter of 2019. The increase is primarily related to higher SOCs compliance costs,
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:07.840]   legal consulting and audit costs. Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was 12.2 million euros
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:15.520]   or 16 cents per common share of 10.3 million euros or 17 cents per common share during the
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:21.280]   second quarter of 2019. The weighted number of common shares outstanding for the quarter ended
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:28.000]   June 30th 2020 were 79.2 million. I will now turn the call back to Adi. Adi?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:38.720]   Thank you Angus. As you can see from our presentation today we're taking advantage of
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.960]   the knowledge that we've gained in the field of innate immunity and are applying it to our
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.600]   programs going forward. This experience in working with the innate immune system
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:59.040]   is something that we have uniquely established at AFMAT and is helping us in guiding the design
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:06.080]   of unique therapies which now have the potential to address very different kinds of cancers.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:15.040]   I just want to point out here that the EGFR is expressed in more than 10 tumors and that gives us
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:24.240]   a lot of optionality how to take this molecule forward. We're pleased with how things are moving
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.960]   forward for both our clinical and preclinical programs especially in the current environment.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:37.280]   Our preclinical programs are in track AFM 13 and 24 are moving forward according to plan
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   and genetic is moving things forward with the NTPC/MA/CD16A inertial engagement.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.400]   What are our inflection points for the next one and a half years for AFM 13?
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:57.120]   We've mentioned that we want to present the interim data in peripheral T cell
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:07.360]   lymphoma around middle of next year. We've been successful in our collaboration with MD Anderson
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:15.920]   moving forward the combination of AFM 13 and COPLUS derived natural killer cells. As we said
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.760]   we're ready to start or MD Anderson is ready to start and we hope to report first patient then
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:29.520]   and we will provide updates as we move forward. For AFM 24 we are in the midst of
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:37.200]   dose escalation in order to generate safety and activity data. This is quite exciting for us
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:44.800]   because it's a drug with a very differentiated profile as profile as compared to the other
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:53.280]   moieties currently used in targeting EGF receptor. Now with the dose escalation and establishing
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:59.840]   the safety we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.880]   dose cohort expansion but as we've mentioned earlier is also planning early on to move forward
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.920]   into combinations. We're very happy with the progress in the genetic collaboration
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:20.800]   we've just provided the next update for the BCMA CD16A Engager we have multiple other programs
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:28.080]   ongoing and if things go well pending on program progression we can bring in additional milestone.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:39.600]   And for our newest additions to the pipeline with AFM 28 and AFM 32 we are starting behind enabling
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:47.440]   studies so that we can have an ID filing first for AFM 28. Finally before we open the session
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:54.240]   for Q&A I would like to thank all our employees for their contribution and express our gratitude
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:00.240]   my gratitude in particular for our investigators and the clinical sites the patients and in
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.600]   all their families and our investors who are supporting us in our efforts to develop these
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:13.200]   innovative treatments for cancer patients. It is through the combined efforts of all of you
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:20.080]   that keeps us on the path of discovery and innovation. I'm now happy to close the presentation
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:26.480]   and we're open now for questions. Thank you. Please and young men we will now begin the
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.520]   question and answer session. As a reminder should you wish to ask a question you will be depressed
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.320]   star in the number one on the telephone ring for me to get out. If you wish to cancel it and depress
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:43.280]   the pound or hash key. Once again it's star in one for questions. First question comes from
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:54.240]   the line of Maui Rakoff. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:01.520]   To start off just wondering for AFM 24 I'm not sure how much you can say on this but just
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:09.040]   wondering if both patients in core two have been dosed and if you can talk more about the
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.840]   timing of dosing between patients and what the foresight activated can you provide any
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:19.920]   more perspective about enrollment pace going forward. Andreas can you take the question please?
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:28.080]   Yeah so there were multiple parts of the questions I hope I got them all. So the phase one study of
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:37.600]   AFM 24 as we said we are recruiting into second cohort we have not yet disclosed how many patients
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:49.360]   as you know it's a standard 3x3 design with a Bayesian dose modification but that's basically
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:56.800]   what it is. In terms of timing between the patients there is a mandatory eight day waiting period
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:03.520]   between patients so they cannot be treated all at the same time but will be staggered with
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:11.920]   eight day intervals and there was another part of the question around the four participating sites.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:18.880]   Right yeah just wondering if you can provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:26.560]   forward. Yeah currently the enrollment pace is as pre-spressified by the protocol so
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:33.600]   all sites are very active in screening patients and as we said all sites have already contributed
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:44.480]   patients. Got it okay great and then also for AFM 24 just checking if you can say more about
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.760]   the tumor types that you're screening for the study and if you can also provide more perspective
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:33:00.400]   into the checkpoint inhibitor and combo plans at this point. So for the tumor types in the dose
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:10.640]   escalation part we are accepting all patients with or all histologies that our EJFR are expressing
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:18.560]   and where the patient has exhausted the respective standard of care treatments. As Adi mentioned this
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:26.560]   is a wide variety of potential tumors probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:32.960]   cancer and non small cell lung cancer and these are the two histologies where we would expect
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:40.400]   probably the majority of patients in the phase one having said that the dose escalation part would
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:47.200]   but also be be open for other EJFR expressing tumors like for example head and neck cancer
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:55.840]   gastric cancer or other solid tumors. Now once we have defined our dose limiting toxicities
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:01.040]   or if there are no dose limiting toxicities we have defined the recommended phase two dose
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:09.840]   we will enroll into tumor specific expansion cohorts and these expansion cohorts are
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:19.440]   currently in the process of being defined. Now for our PD1 combination plans based on the
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:26.320]   interesting data we have seen with PD1 in combination with AFM 13 which aren't referred to
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:35.840]   with a very encouraging complete response rate in excess of 40 percent we plan to have a combination
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:46.480]   with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor open rather soon probably in parallel to the last cohorts of
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.840]   the dose escalation of the single agent study so it will be more or less a parallel development
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:35:06.960]   that we are anticipating right now. Great okay thanks for the additional perspective. Any
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:21.040]   follow-up questions? Next question comes from the line of Jim from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead Jim.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:29.280]   Hi guys congrats on all the progress maybe just a first quick question for Angus to start him off
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.960]   collaborative research revenues is that expected to be a stable number
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.080]   between the you know three to four million level or is there any reason that might
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:46.320]   go up as programs progress and as we think about the milestone that got paid in the third quarter
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:52.000]   is it a simple matter to back out the assumptions around collaborative research revenues and that
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.840]   will give us some sense of the milestone given that you can't say it explicitly.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:03.040]   Yeah yeah thanks Jim for the question so you know our revenue numbers fluctuate from quarter
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:08.320]   to quarter you know based primarily on the number of hours that we're working on the various
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:14.000]   genetic programs that are in progress I mean you can see just looking back at the last several
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.240]   quarters we've been you know fairly fairly range range bound and call it the two million to five
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:25.600]   million zone you know when you see increases it's typically a result of quant and time milestone
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:32.800]   payments that we receive so you know this this milestone payments that we discussed today that we'll
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:38.560]   get in the third quarter will likely increase our revenues in the third quarter and that would be
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:43.200]   sort of an add-on to the to the range you've seen over the last several quarters of that again kind
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:50.320]   of two to five million dollars two to five million euros rather but okay that's that's helpful
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:57.520]   and then maybe just on cohort one for AFM 24 and what we might learn from that cohort
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:04.080]   can you remind us if you're doing pre and post biopsies and what kind of translational work
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.720]   you might be doing and you know how that might inform you know the ability to recruit
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.120]   innate cells to the tumor site?
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:20.320]   Yeah so in the dose escalation part we do pre treatment biopsy
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:29.360]   post or on treatment biopsies are optional we do have a significant correlative science program
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:36.480]   looking at peripheral activation markers of NK cells as well as on cytokine profiles
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:44.880]   once we are in the expansion phase so we are recruiting into tumor specific cohorts I think
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:50.160]   this is the part where we will get most of the correlative science as we have a more homogeneous
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:59.200]   patient population we maintain our requirement for a pre treatment biopsy and we'll have post
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:08.000]   or on treatment biopsies and selected cohorts and then just you know given the comments on the
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:18.400]   variability and peripheral NK cell populations is there any sense in screening patients for
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:25.440]   their NK cell levels given that you know patients who screen low may not have adequate NK cells
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.960]   or macrophages to recruit or you feel like within the variability of innate cell
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.320]   in the blood that you'll be able to have an effective treatment and it's not worth screening
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:45.360]   for that variable I think currently it would be premature to yeah depends on what you mean with
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:52.720]   screening so we are definitely determining the levels of search lading NK cells and also looking
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:39:00.640]   at some of their characteristics I think we currently do not have enough data to define
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:08.800]   a cutoff or a threshold and this may very well vary between tumor histologies and also be dependent
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   on the infiltration of NK cells in the tumor microenvironment variable which we have seen
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:24.960]   in our AFM Columbia study to have some impact on the likelihood to respond to patients so
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:32.400]   think in the beginning of the program we will be open for all commerce we will assess all
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:38.320]   of these important biomarkers and then based on the activity data and the readouts that we are
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:44.720]   seeing we may modify as a program defining certain thresholds but currently I think it
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:52.240]   would be premature to do that and maybe just a final question just the ambianders in collaboration
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:59.920]   is focused on cord blood derived NK cells is there any thought to other NK cell sources
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:07.200]   including potentially IPSC derived NK cells um
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.760]   Adi you want to take this question or should I take it no well I under why don't you go ahead
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:23.360]   okay uh yeah you're right link cord blood derived NK cells is one source of NK cells
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:33.760]   and if you watch the field of NK cell um based approaches especially the the field
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:39.840]   around companies and institutes are providing different sources of NK cells there is
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:47.120]   definitely speed picking up and then there is a variety of options to to look at and
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:55.760]   this is what we do not only from our side but we have also received proactive inquiries
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:05.520]   of potential working models together so we are looking at the entire NK cell field and then
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:12.880]   evaluate various options there great thanks for taking the question guys maybe a quick comment
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:19.840]   so we see this cord blood derived NK cells already quite advanced in clinical development
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.800]   so there have already been many patients treated while with the IPSC is currently there is still a
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:34.160]   the safety to be determined and obviously in combination we learn more on their functionalities
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:42.960]   so this is somewhat yet to us on how functional an ITSC derived versus a peripheral NK cell is
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:49.440]   and it's good to see the first clinical data so we're quite not only happy but we've we've
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.920]   checked so many different options at the moment for NK cells and we're indeed very convinced about
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.920]   the activity of the cord blood derived cells from MD Anderson
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:10.080]   great thanks Adi thank you our next question comes from the line of IG from BMO capital
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.400]   the line is now open please go ahead
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:20.080]   hey good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my question this is Ekion for DOHKIM
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:27.360]   just a couple regarding the BCMA and they engage her I understand that you have limited
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:36.080]   visibility on the entirety of the clinical bill pathway but if you can provide any type of insight
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:44.480]   in terms of what genetic kind of has planned may in terms of could it potentially pursue
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:56.080]   an accelerated pathway for the assets and secondly again you don't provide complete details
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.960]   on the that milestone payments but if you can provide us some additional perspective on
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:11.120]   what the future milestones for that said might hold in terms of you know phase two phase three
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.720]   things of that sort should we expect increasing size of value for each milestone payments
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.640]   that'd be helpful for us thanks
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:25.360]   Adi maybe I take the question on the pathway and then hand over to you for the milestones
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:34.160]   yes please go ahead on it so thanks for the question I mean as you already correctly say
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.760]   we cannot really speak in detail for genetic but we can share with you I think you're aware
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:47.120]   of course licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal we did with genetic they're
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:54.640]   obviously excited about the strong differentiation potential of the molecule also demonstrated
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:01.360]   at ACR at the poster just to review again a very strong preclinical cell killing selective
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:08.720]   no cytokine release very good safety profile and good pharmacodynamic marker specific BCMA
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:16.480]   plasma cell killing in the Sinnoh monkey so you know despite the also recent
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:26.000]   approvals of the you know income first encumbers in the space I would say that genetic shares
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.760]   our excitement with the differentiation potential and the way for a potentially best in class molecule
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:40.560]   maybe I I leave it there I think it's it's a it's a clearly strongly clinically validated space
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:48.480]   and I think this molecule will enable genetic and we as their partner to you know have a
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:56.320]   strong position in the space yeah regarding the financials so I just want to recall the deal
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:06.000]   when it was signed so we received 96 million in upfront cash and I can get the total of
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:13.600]   more than 5 billion in milestones that are in different categories so there are a preclinical
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:19.040]   model there's a preclinical milestone payment there are indeed multiple clinical milestone
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:27.920]   payments regulatory and sales milestones and on top we can receive royalties which as we described
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:35.840]   are on the higher end of what you would expect for the early nature of the license
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:45.680]   agreement beyond that we're able to disclose any further details unless genetic would allow us
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:52.720]   or rush would allow us to do so usually and that's just a general statement is that the payments
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:46:00.400]   will increase the further the program progresses okay thank you for that and just one more quick
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:07.600]   question I think I might have misheard it and this is in regards to AFM 24 I believe you've
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:14.880]   mentioned that there was a patient that had increased in all six cytokine levels that would
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:21.600]   resolve over 24 hours I'm just curious was that self-resolving or did that patient receive
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:29.920]   and all six inhibitor yeah I can thanks for bringing that up and clarification so the transient
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:38.000]   our six increase was reported in the iron enabling synotox study what you you referred to the ACR
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.440]   poster indeed we saw that with the dosing any kind of moderate peak that quickly went down was
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:52.000]   completely resolved without any any treatment obviously you know one doesn't do that in the
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.360]   because this is synotox study and again when we see this in the context because it was transient
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:03.040]   and fully reversed leads us to the conclusion which of course will be looked at carefully in
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:12.240]   patients that we should not expect any kind of cytokine release syndrome okay thank you for
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:29.200]   that clarification sure thank you next question comes from John from your company hello yes
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:37.440]   hello yeah hi can you hi sorry that's my headsets fall out thanks for taking the questions my first
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:46.320]   question is that for the AFM 13 in the for the registration study that the it's assignment two
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:56.400]   set up so what might be the threshold of ORR in the 40 patients and sort of intermediate
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:07.920]   leadout before you can move forward so just curious what any information you can reveal on that front
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:14.000]   right we cannot give a concrete response rate it's based also on the Bayesian design so there are some
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.800]   independence of response rates but we usually do not disclose thresholds but it's a classical
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:31.120]   simon two-stage design okay no problem and also just curious in terms of AFM 24 that
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:40.480]   your dose escalating but at least based on the animal data is any thoughts where when you might
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:50.320]   start to see the potential effective dose to start I think currently it's not possible to predict
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:58.400]   when we will have the optimal biologically active dose as there are a number of covariance like
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:08.400]   binding sites for CD16 binding sites for EGFR and then distribution and as you know the animal
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:16.560]   models especially in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are very difficult to translate
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:23.520]   the relevant talk species and after all that's only a talk species is the synomorgous monkey
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:32.480]   however we do not have any synomorgous monkey tumor models available so we cannot really bridge
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:39.200]   between what we see in the toxicology studies and then what we would see in terms of efficacy for
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:45.280]   for tumors so it will be something that we will have to define in our in our clinical program
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:51.920]   okay great maybe I want to stick in one last question here is that
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:59.920]   in terms of adaptive in case cell from the cobala not deriving itself
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:07.440]   it first of all could that be potentially used in sort of tumor and any comments
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:18.640]   comments in terms of regarding that this is as Adi said something that we are actively looking
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:28.800]   into we're starting out with lymphomas obviously with AFM 13 targeting CD 30 but our vision
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:37.840]   is that also for AFM 24 we will develop certain development options in combination with NK cells
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:43.440]   could be cord blood derived NK cells could be NK cells from another source
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:49.440]   that is something that we will define but the intention is also to to have a
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:56.080]   have a program where AFM 24 would be partnered with exogenous NK cells
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:02.720]   okay great thanks appreciated and congrats for another project this far
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:14.240]   yep no further question at this time for any closing remarks please go ahead speakers
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:20.800]   yeah thank you again for listening in and following our our updates
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:30.080]   the the program is coming smoothly along despite that we are affected by uh by covid
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:35.840]   we have strengthened the team significantly in order to address any issues that may relate
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:44.960]   to the conductance of this clinical trials or to the interactions with the with the specific
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:51.760]   side so we're very happy to be able to have been able to address any of the issues that have
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:57.280]   been arising and I indeed want to thank again the entire team here at AFMET for
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:05.440]   managing all that through this difficult times we're quite excited that we can move forward
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.400]   these programs either as monotherapies and now looking at the different options of
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:17.920]   of combination if you've heard we focus on NK cells and checkpoint inhibitors in particular
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:26.080]   PD1s or PDO1s so we feel that we have with the multiple programs addressing different targets
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:34.720]   we can provide a cadence of data over the next quarters and in years and very happy to report
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:40.320]   any additional updates as we move along thanks a lot again for listening in and all the best
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.960]   good point thank you that doesn't do that conference today thank you all for participating
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:51.040]   email disconnect stay safe everyone thank you

[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.080]   for the 3rd Quarter end of September 27th 2020. Yesterday afternoon we issued a press release
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.360]   providing an overview of our financial performance for the quarter including a reconciliation
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.280]   of any non-gap measures we may discuss. The copy of the release is available in the Investor

[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.120]   today's call we contain certain forelooking statements that represent our outlook and
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.840]   current expectations as of the day of this release. Other additional factors non-anticipated
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.720]   by management may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.840]   these forelooking statements. Very information concerning those factors has been provided
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.520]   in today's press release on NK and our regular filings with the SEC. I'd now like to turn
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.320]   the call over to Fabius Andrii.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.640]   Thank you Denny. Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us today. For the
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.640]   third quarter of 2020 we reported net revenues of 3.08 billion and adjusted EBITAL 305 million
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.720]   or 9.9 percent margin, 18 percent higher than an year ago and adjusted GAP EPS of 66 cents.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our global team for their continuing commitment,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.800]   dedication and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.240]   healthy by maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.440]   time. I could not be more proud of our team as they have continued to come together to
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.200]   support one another, our customers and consumers.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.520]   Peace is a condition appearance and our team members responded admirably to the unprecedented
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.600]   conditions, supplying products to our customers. We are continuously adapting our global operations
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.000]   to the change in channel demand while adjusting our operations to be able to maintain the
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.520]   operations at all our plans and minimize any significant disruption due to labor and health
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.200]   issues. We remain diligent in implementing precautionary, proactive steps to better safeguard
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.840]   the wellness and help of each team member while fulfilling our official duty as a food
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.520]   producer to consumers in every region where we operate. We incurred direct COVID-19 mitigation
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.160]   costs of roughly 27 million for the quarter and close to 77 million year to date. The
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.500]   direct costs are related to the extra cleaning of our production and common areas, the extra
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.920]   PPE and the including masks and face shoes that we are providing to all of our team members
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.720]   and installation of physical barriers in our production areas. We also installed dual technology,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.600]   UV and bipolar ionization in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.960]   We are offering free light health online services that allow for virtual doctor visits and no
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.240]   cost and above all CDC guidelines. We remove vulnerable team members from facilities with
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:22.080]   full pay and benefits during community outbreaks. These figures include indirect cost there
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.540]   are more there are a lot of indirect cost there are more difficult to precisely quantify such
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.240]   as overall disruptions to our operations less optimal mix and production efficiencies that
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.560]   are not included in these numbers. Also we are supporting our communities with our home
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.080]   strong initiative. It is an example of how we value the importance role with playing the
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.460]   communities where our team members live and work. We understand the responsibility that
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.760]   comes with being a major employer in rural communities and we work hard to contribute
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.880]   to the well being of those communities by not only providing gainful employment opportunities
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.400]   but also participating in volunteers donation and sponsorship opportunities. This quarter
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.820]   we accrued $50 million in SGNA for this initiative. Then to the specifics of our business despite
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.800]   continuing volatility and challenging market environments in Q3 and added operating costs
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.040]   we have continued to generate the superior relative performance to the competition and
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.360]   have remained resilient to market fluctuations. This is a reflection of our portfolio approach
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.240]   including the strategy on well-diversified products broad geographical footprints and
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.040]   relentless focus on key customers. For the full quarter operating performance both in
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.760]   U.S. and Mexico significantly improved sequentially and Europe also continue to increase despite
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.640]   the challenges due to COVID-19. In Q3 we saw market conditions continue to recover across
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.440]   all of our global operations with U.S. and particularly Mexico experiencing the struggle
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.000]   rebound in performance relative to weak conditions during the first half of the year. We are
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.300]   pleased with the results especially when taking into account all the disruptions less than
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.480]   optimal product mix and added operating cost when compared to the environment in 2019.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.540]   Despite continuing challenges in global market conditions due to COVID-19 our consolidated
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.100]   results have also remained well balanced and the result of our vision to become the best
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.040]   and most respected company creating the opportunity for a better future for our team members. To
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.620]   support our vision we are continuing to implement our strategy of developing a unique portfolio
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.520]   of diverse complementary business models continue to relentless pursue operational excellence
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.480]   becoming a more valid partner with key customers and creating an informed environment for safe
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:46.440]   people safe products and healthy attitudes. While market conditions in all our global operations
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   are continuing to improve during the quarter food service demand globally still has not
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.040]   reached prior levels and the environments are still quite challenging some sectors where
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.360]   we operate disruptions from COVID-19 have continued to present a significant challenge
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.180]   on each individual country's demand for protein consumption as well as for the flow of global
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:13.760]   trades and generate volatility far beyond normal seasonal factors. We maintain our strategy
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.320]   where continue to improve the portfolio to better respond to individual market dynamics
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.340]   and generate a relative increase in performance over our peers. We believe this approach will
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.420]   give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to long run and minimize the full
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.060]   peaks and troughs of the commodity sectors. During the third quarter in the U.S. we are
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.660]   continuing to see the demand recovered at our fresh operations including from some sectors
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.820]   within food food service with more states gradually losing travel and movement restrictions.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:51.080]   QSL volume has been especially strong and demand from our customers has been outperforming
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:57.180]   the industry. Similar to last quarter commodity large bird deboning was also again the most
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:03.180]   challenge during Q3 operationally however we continue to improve our relative performance
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.500]   versus the industry across all business units. We are continuing to adapt to the shipping
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:14.420]   channel demand by increasing our volume mix to key customer retailers. In addition a large
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.800]   portion of our food service customers are also within the QSL segment which has further
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.100]   denting the impact across our fresh business unit models. Our portfolio of differentiated
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.220]   products along with our key customer model are giving us better installation against
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.740]   the volatility. We are also much better positioned to adjust products and channel mix giving
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:41.140]   our presence across all bird sizes from small to large. Within those small birds and case
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:46.300]   ready segments market supply and demand was again very well balanced during Q3. Demand
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.180]   from retailers especially from our key customers was strong supporting improved performance
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.100]   of our key brandy business. Our market leadership in these categories and more differentiated
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.420]   product portfolio have continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive advances versus
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:07.040]   the industry. While we commit meant to our key customer strategy has been reflected in
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.700]   the consistency for past results the value of this approach has never been more relevant
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.780]   to our growth than during the current times of great uncertainties and challenges. To
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.020]   further support the growth of key customers we are doubling our case ready capacity at
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.340]   our plant in Minnesota by increasing the number of heads processed at the plant while also
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:31.480]   raising the mix of more stable margin case ready products. With this addition we also
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.580]   expect to increase by 20 percent our production of our differentiated higher attributes just
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:42.940]   bear brand products. It is also supported our conversion of one plant from the commoditized
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:49.780]   large bird deboning to a key customer QSR in the small bird segment. The strong relationships
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.060]   we have with key customers are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.740]   since this customer rely on us to satisfy their needs for growth. In addition many of
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:05.220]   our key customers maintain a leadership position in their respective categories. As a result
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.100]   we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition beyond driving
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.780]   peer growth our key customer strategy also promotes trust enhances long term relationships
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:21.740]   and strengthen our margin structure. In the US prepare foods business revenue declined
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:28.500]   23 percent on 26 percent less volume year over year. A large part of this decrease 70
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.700]   percent of the volume was driven by schools remaining close partially upset by strength
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:39.380]   in the retail demand. On the other hand our margin from sales have improved 29 percent
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:45.100]   driven by more favorable price and mix. We continue to simplify our portfolio to improve
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:51.420]   efficiencies and sheet resources towards branded growth in the retail channel. Our pilgrims
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:57.660]   brand sales grew 52 percent in our just bear brand gain and new distribution resulting
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:04.300]   in dollar share growth in the retail channel 32 code storage data at the end of August
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.900]   brawler inventory was up 2 percent from the close of Q2 but down 1 percent from the previous
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:15.340]   year like quarter inventories were up 10 percent compared to last year. This is not surprising
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.260]   considering the mixed simplification doing to ongoing labor constraints seen during Q3
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:26.500]   and overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result of COVID 19. As some markets reopened
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.580]   and the pipelines are empty we are seeing some increasing lack quarter sales during October
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:38.120]   and our reduction in inventories and upward movement in prices. U.S. poultry exports including
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:45.900]   pause were up 4.7 percent year over year throughout August brawler need alone was up 3 percent.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:52.460]   In contrast through Q3 our exports have increased by 14 percent year over year out facing the
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.260]   market. China continues to be a significant growth driver and we believe the impact of
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:02.820]   ASS in South East Asia and now Germany can provide further support to export demand.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:09.100]   As we approach the one year anniversary of China reopening to U.S. poultry producers are
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.900]   presented with a vastly different market landscape than a year ago. China has solidified itself
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:20.700]   as one of the largest export destinations for poultry second only to Mexico. China's present
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:26.980]   as a significant buyer keeps diversification of our export portfolio a high priority. We
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:33.260]   have added 95 new direct clients in 2020 and have also continued to diversify our product
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:39.420]   and destination mix. Sales of non-traditional export items are up 30 percent year over year
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:46.140]   which strengthen the cutout margin. We enter Q4 with Optimus as we continue to place commodity
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.860]   items efficiently, leverage business overall portfolio diversity and prioritize exceptional
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.820]   customer service to meet the needs of our key customers around the world. After a very
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:02.660]   challenging first half in 2020 our Mexican operations delivered great results in Q3 and
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.860]   we recorded one of the strongest Q3 in the company's history despite the favorable mix
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:13.700]   impacted and added operation costs relative to the same period last year. More normalized
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:19.620]   economic activities and improved supply demand balance in the market are increased share
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.980]   of non commodity products and are very good operational performance all contributed to
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.700]   the results. Although overall demand is improving we remain agile and are continuing to adapt
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:34.180]   our facilities by shifting production to those channels that are experienced better relative
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:40.180]   demand. The persons in Mexico experienced some challenges especially in the value categories
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:45.180]   due to less traffic on retail combined with a contraction in the QSR volume. But we began
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.860]   to see some signs of improvements towards the end of the quarter and we believe the
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:54.400]   positive trend can be sustained into Q4. We remain committed in low-term growth and demand
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.480]   prospect to the Mexico where continue to invest in all the idea and premium pilgrims brand
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.540]   both in fresh and in prepared as well as seeing more market share in the modern channel
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:11.620]   which will bring more stable margins to our operations. Our European chicken operations
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:18.620]   deliver an EBIT in Q3 that was 13% sequentially above Q2 with both volumes and revenue 7%
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:24.260]   and 18% higher respectively. Supported by our exposure to retail and the continues recovering
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:30.940]   food service and QSR demand in particular. Relative to Q3 of 2019 EBITs were still higher
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:39.500]   2% despite 8% lower volume and 5% lower revenue. Evening of COVID-19 restrictions the introduction
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.820]   of UK government incentive directs towards food service as well as a consistent improvement
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.620]   in food service demand within continental Europe have all contributed to a better sequentially
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:56.260]   improved performance versus the prior party. They still have not yet reached prior levels.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:01.060]   Even during these challenging times we continue to be relentless in investing in innovation.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:06.240]   Delivering labor and new improvements, driving better efficiencies, managing our cost base
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.500]   and offsetting cost increases to lean manufacturing techniques and capital investments around automation
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.780]   and process flow without sacrificing the health and wellbeing of our team members which remains
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.860]   a priority. We are committed to delivering the safest work environment possible improving
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.980]   the quality of our products while achieving our sustainability agenda and bird welfare
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:33.020]   targets. Our relative performance to the industry measure as the result of the last 12 months
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:38.420]   continues to show us improving and are facing the average of the competition in Europe.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:43.380]   For the next quarter we expect further improvements coming from the food service and QSR segments
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:48.300]   as these segments adapt to the situation in each country and we remain vigilant and prepared
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:54.100]   to react and adapt in case market conditions change. The performance of our newly acquired
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:16:00.000]   European pork operations has continued to improve with EBITDA on an upward momentum.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.940]   We have now been profitable on an EBITDA basis for the last six quarters in a row with margins
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.940]   also increasing on a consistent basis. The improvement in performance was driven by robust
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.620]   demand at retail partially offset by reduction in food service. Continuous strengthening
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.820]   pork exports especially to China as well as the implementation of operation improvements
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:26.220]   and capture of synergies. Exports to China remained strong and were up 100% in Q3. Also
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.060]   exports to China have doubled as a percentage of our total pork sales and we expect demands
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.860]   from China continue to drive and strengthen our follow overall exports in the near future.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.980]   All of our European fresh pork facilities are approved to export from China so we are
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:47.980]   well positioned to benefit from those opportunities. We also continue to evolve in our strategy
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:54.000]   and we will significantly increase our volumes with a new key customer in the next quarters.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.420]   Integration of the assets is all tracked to expectations. Over the next few years we expect
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.780]   to generate an EBITDA improvement to achieve a level that is competitive with leading companies
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:10.020]   with similar portfolio. We have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.820]   European assets through some recent wins to increase our retail exposure and strengthen
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.900]   our partnership with key customers. We are optimistic about building upon our operation
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:25.140]   improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint, extract best-in-class
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:31.820]   operational access, capitalize export to goods, optimize the portfolio of channels, segments
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.580]   and products as well as strengthening our growth business with key customers to drive
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:42.180]   innovation in value added and higher margin areas. We have a great team in Europe dedicated
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:48.100]   to generating the best possible relative results by focusing on factors within our control
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.380]   while ensuring and protecting the safety and health of our team members.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:58.820]   Portresses has been rising since August driven higher by a combination of stronger than expected
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:05.300]   export demand and smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the U.S. USDA is projecting
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:12.260]   new crop ending stocks at 2.17 billion bushels versus 1.99 billion last year, which includes
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:18.380]   a 550 million bushels increase in export demand. The current corn crop is projected
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:25.220]   at 14.7 billion bushels, the highest in four years and over 1 billion bushels larger than
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:30.380]   last year. Although corn prices have risen from the lows we saw in August, prices are
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.240]   very similar to where they were this time last year.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.780]   Soybean yield prices have also risen since August driven higher by larger than expected
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:46.600]   export demand, primarily to China. USDA is projecting the current soybean crop at 4.3
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:52.660]   billion bushels, up over 700 million from last year. Despite the large increase in production,
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.500]   USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 290 million bushels, the lowest level
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:03.020]   in four years. The uncertainty over the size of the Chinese import program is causing increasing
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.360]   uncertainty and volatility in the oil seeds market globally.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.260]   Wheat prices in Europe has also risen recently despite the larger than expected Russian wheat
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:18.060]   crop and projected increased supply in other major wheat exporters like Australia. A slow
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.860]   start to the planting season in Russia and larger than expected export demand out of
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.340]   the U.S. are contributing to the rise prices in the wheat market.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:32.460]   On the chicken production, according to USDA, Q3 was down half of a percent relative to
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:38.460]   Q3 2019, as increased live weights did not offset head count reductions. The industry
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.540]   continues to maintain a larger layer flock with current levels 4.4 percent above last
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:49.100]   year, in line with the trends observed in Q1X3. The industry has also managed to reduce
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.620]   the average age of laying hands, promoting a younger, more efficient breed. This has
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.060]   allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to manage supply of eggs in the short term
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.220]   while enabling growth in the long term as the demand environment improves.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.020]   Overall, the trend has shown a slowing of bullet placement growth, which is in line
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.420]   with expectations, given that most of the bullet placement increases in 2019 and early
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:20.100]   to 2020 were expected to be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period.
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:26.820]   From Q2 to Q3, COVID-19 related restrictions have slowly been rolled back, with many businesses
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:33.420]   and restaurants opening under modified environments to protect workers and consumer health. Throughout
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.500]   this process, consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal and have continued
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.500]   to modify their shopping and spending habits in response to the new normal environment.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.180]   This new consumer environment favors the retail channel, as many consumers are still required
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:54.620]   to work from home and choosing to limit exposure to potentially more crowded areas. As a result,
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.860]   retail demands for chickens, like that of all proteins, have remained supportive throughout
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:04.420]   the quarter. While food thefts demand still trail below years ago level, this trend has
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:09.780]   been highly adaptable and continues to improve each month from the low points in April led
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:16.900]   by the QSR segment. Entering Q4, the USDA expects production to be flat for the quarter
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:23.500]   on a year-over-year basis. Before entering Q221, in which the USDA expects oil production
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:31.380]   to grow 0.9% versus 2020. High unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute to a food
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.660]   marker environment and the fallout effects of COVID-19 will impact the channels differently.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:42.540]   We expect the restriction of restaurant capacities, social distancing guidelines, consumer concerns
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.380]   for individual health and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:54.620]   to continue favoring the increased frequency of at-home meals. Since chicken continues
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:59.820]   to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins, retail demand is likely to remain
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:06.580]   above year ago levels. When we expect overall food thefts demand to remain more volatile
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:12.180]   and remain below year ago levels, at least in the near term, QSR's ability to adapt quickly
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.100]   to the new environment in a positive sign for the chicken industry moving from late 2020
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:24.860]   to 2021. Our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:30.440]   while minimizing the impacts from volatility in market conditions. While we are already
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.100]   well balanced in terms of our birth size exposure, we will remain diligent in seeking opportunities
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:40.300]   to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.860]   by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers while optimizing
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:50.340]   our existing operations and pursuing operational improvement targets. Our key customer approach
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:55.920]   is strategic and creates the basis for further accelerate growth in important categories
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.380]   by promoting more customized, high quality, innovative products to give us a clear, long
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.700]   term, sustained competitive advantage while further improving the resilience to market
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:12.380]   filtration. With that, let's turn to additional details to our financials. IRF/CNA in the
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.180]   third quarter was higher versus year ago as we improved the efficiencies of our expenses
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.820]   but increased support for expanding the JustBear brand nationally and the investment for our
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.620]   new prepared foods products, both in the US and Mexico, as well as the inclusion of the
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:32.660]   new assets in Europe. Also included in the report at SGNA is our $50 million contribution
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:38.580]   to the hometown strong initiative and the DOJ agreement. We will continue to prioritize
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.700]   our capital spending plan this year to optimize our product mix that is aimed at improving
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:48.820]   our ability to supply innovative, less commoditized products and strengthening partnerships with
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:55.060]   key customers. Even during these uncertainty times, while we continue to evaluate all CAPEX
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:24:00.220]   projects and defer those we deem known essential, we reiterate our commitment to investing
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.980]   on strong return on capital employee projects that will improve our operational efficiencies
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:10.660]   and tailor customer needs to further solidify competitive advantage for families. Our balance
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:16.380]   sheets continue to be robust, given our relentless emphasis on cash flow for operating activities,
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:21.060]   focus on management of working capital and discipline investment in high return projects.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:26.020]   Our liquidity position remains very strong, with more than $1.3 billion in total cash
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:31.340]   unavailability. We have no short-term immediate cash requirements without bonds maturing
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:38.500]   in 2025 and 2027 and our turnover maturing in 2023. During the quarter, our net debt
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:44.300]   was $1.9 billion, the lowest since 2016, and a leverage ratio for 2.5 times less than
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:50.540]   12 months ago. Our leverage remains at a manageable level and we expect to continue to produce
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.020]   positive cash flows this year, increasing our financial capability to pursue strategic
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:25:02.620]   actions. We expect 2020 interest expense of around $130 to $140 million. We have a strong
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.620]   balance sheet and leverage that is within our target, which are supportive for us to act
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.260]   on great opportunities during these uncertain times. We will remain focused on exercising
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.340]   great care and ensuring that we create shareholder value by optimizing our capital structure
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.540]   while preserving the flexibility to pursue a growth strategy. We will continue to consider
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:26.220]   and evaluate all relevant capital allocation strategies that will match the pursuit of
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.940]   our growth strategy and continue to review each prospect accordingly to our value-creating
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:37.140]   standards. Operator, these conclusions are prepared remarks. Please open the call for
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.140]   questions.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:44.060]   Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. In the interest of allowing
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:49.100]   equal access, we request that you limit your questions to two. Then we join the queue for
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.860]   any follow-up. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your fingerprint phone.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.700]   If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:04.780]   minimize background noise. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. At this
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.820]   time, we will press momentarily to assemble our roster.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:18.300]   The next question is from Benjamin Toyder with Barclays. Please go ahead.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:27.260]   Hi. Good morning. How are you doing? This is Anthony Hernandez on behalf of Ben Toyder.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:33.260]   My question is regarding COVID-19. How is your current level of absenteeism at plant?
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.500]   How has that evolved in recent weeks considering the continuously high number of cases in the
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:45.940]   U.S.? Also, if you can provide some of a kind of a wrong rate of protective measures related
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:50.980]   to COVID-19 during the quarter and what do you see going forward? Thanks.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:57.300]   Thank you. Good morning. First, as we face this global coronavirus pandemic, we have
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.300]   been guided by three principles. First, an uncompromised commitment to the safety of
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:07.580]   our team members. Second, recognizing and embracing our responsibility to provide quality
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:12.860]   food for the country and, of course, endeavoring to provide continuing employment opportunities
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:17.540]   and benefits to our team members during a time of unprecedented economic appeal. So
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:23.500]   the direct costs that we are related to the extra cleaning in our production in common
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:29.180]   areas. We also provide the PPE and including the masks and feed shoes to all of our team
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:33.920]   members. And we install physical barriers in our production area and, of course, we are
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:40.840]   maintaining social distancing wherever -- wherever areas we can. We do more than 10,000 barriers
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.380]   within the first 30 days of the pandemic and we continue to upgrade those barriers.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:52.060]   We also install the dual technology UV and bipolar ionization in every plant to filter
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:59.100]   the air and neutralize potential viruses. As I mentioned, we are offering free lives
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:05.440]   and health online services for all of our team members that allow for virtual doctor visits
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.460]   at zero costs. And above all CDC guidelines, we remove the vulnerable team members from
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.380]   facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreak. And that is creating
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:21.180]   some challenges to our operations because by removing those people, we have less people
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:28.620]   at our plants. Yeah, it -- the situation is very fluid. It varies from plant to plant,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:34.420]   but over the last months we have increased our staffing to close to the levels that we
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:43.160]   were before COVID. So we are already running a much better mix that we were during the Q2
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:51.420]   and we are seeing a very good increase in our absenteeism levels. As people are more familiar
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:58.580]   with what we are doing as we are gaining the trust of the entire communities, people are
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:07.420]   less reluctant to return to work. And with that we've been improving our ability to execute
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:13.460]   the optimal mix. Of course we're also working with our key customers to simplify our mix
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:19.740]   to create a more optimal footprint. And with the frequent communication with them, we are
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:25.260]   ensuring they are team members. We expect to return to the optimal operation in this
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.420]   quarter.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:38.380]   Perfect. Thanks a lot. I'm going to work some new results.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.420]   The next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:51.860]   Good morning everyone. Good morning Ken. Just two questions. As you change your mix,
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:58.220]   what was the mix between big, small and medium say last year and then what do you think it's
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.580]   going to be now and then what do you think it's going to be in about a year from now
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.380]   as you adjust your product mixes?
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:12.900]   We are well balanced between small birds, Trey pack and large birdie boning. What we
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:19.300]   are doing is as the demand has been shifting to more retail, we've been shifting our operations
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:26.340]   also with the growth of QSR we've also adapted those conditions. What we are doing for 2021
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:33.900]   is to first move that plant from big birdie boning to small birdie boning which will increase
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:41.860]   our presence in that segment. We are also doubling the capacity in our Minnesota plant
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:48.780]   to comply or support the growth of our key customers and our just fair brand which has
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:54.300]   double the sales in the online channel over this quarter.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:31:02.140]   Looking into overall portfolio, we move from 46% of our total sales in retail to around
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:11.340]   51% just in 2020 with small changes in our operation. For next year expect 2% increase
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:17.980]   in that portfolio to the retail and 1% to 2% increase in the small bird with those two
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.980]   conversions.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:25.540]   Great. My next question is can you talk about the sustainability of the Mexican margins?
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:31.340]   Particularly I did see that there was a little bit of a FX benefit. How do you think about
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.140]   the Mexican operation? I think you did say that it's still continuing the momentum into
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:43.700]   the fourth quarter and how do you think about it for 2021? How do we frame it in our minds?
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:49.660]   Sure. We've been talking about Mexico over the last year that they are very volatile
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:54.140]   quarter over quarter but they are more stable if you take a longer period of time or within
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   a year.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:00.220]   What happened in the first quarter or the first semester in Mexico was a complete imbalance
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:05.740]   during supply and demand. So the industry increased supply during the first semester
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:12.220]   and at the same time demand because of the COVID-19 really creates a challenging environment.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:20.060]   As you remember in Mexico there was no support from the government with the COVID-19 like
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:25.900]   we had in the US and Europe. There was no governmental stimulus or unemployment benefits.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:35.540]   It created a sharp slowdown and recession in the region which really affected the demand
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:42.500]   both in the food service and retail. While in the US we saw an increasing retail compensating
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.460]   at least partially the shut down in food service that didn't happen in Mexico and that's why
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:54.620]   the supply and demand was completely balanced. Has the industry adapted their supply for
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:33:02.260]   the Q3 and we at Pilgrims adapted to that situation as well. We reduced our costs and
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:07.940]   we also cut production. The supply and demand improved a lot and we saw the rebound in the
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:16.380]   food service and demand in Q3 and now we have very stable prices during this time in Mexico.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:23.340]   We expect this to continue during Q4. Q4 has always been a stronger quarter for Mexico
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:29.780]   with the festivities. We don't know at which point that will be reduced because of the
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:35.860]   COVID restrictions. We've seen some increase in cases in Mexico so there could be some
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:41.100]   more restrictions in the Q4 but given the supply and demand situation that we are right
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:48.740]   now the results are sustainable. Now for Q1 we expect the industry to increase production
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:56.700]   to adequate supply and demand and the return to more normal levels. Mexico is really volatile
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:03.780]   quarter over quarter again but we expect to be very stable year over year. Of course our
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.940]   strategy is supportive of the growth to increase the higher margin differentiated products
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:14.700]   as well. We saw a little bit of impact in the prepare foods especially on the more affordable
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:20.420]   products during Q1 but we continue to invest and highly differentiate the pigments products
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:26.540]   continue to sell really well. Long term despite the volatility Mexico is a growing economy
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:31.060]   and as the population increase their disposable income it leads to significant growth in protein
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:40.620]   consumption. Great I really appreciate the answer. Thank you okay. The next question
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.940]   is from Ben Bienvenu with Steven Ng. Please go ahead.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:54.540]   Good morning. I want to ask you touched on it in your opening comments with ASF in China
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.540]   and Germany. I want to ask on Germany more specifically. I think that's a nice boon for
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.340]   the tool of business. Just curious on what you're seeing in that business both as it
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:06.300]   relates to the impact on the domestic market and then an uptick in potential demand from
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:11.580]   that market as well and how you think your position to capture that benefit.
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:19.100]   Yes thank you Ben. The operations in Europe are more focused on the retail. So we produce
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:24.780]   most of our products in UK for the retail UK market and because of the high welfare we
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:32.540]   command the premium in that region. The big competition as you refer is on the food service
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:39.780]   sector of imported products from Poland and Germany mainly and Spain on the pork side.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:46.060]   As the Germans have these issues with their production and because of the ban in China
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:55.700]   it actually increases the sales in the UK market. It also creates the opportunity for our UK
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:02.780]   products to be sold into China. So what we saw is that on the what we call fifth quarter
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:10.020]   products significant increase in pricing but on the normal products like loins and others
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:16.540]   we see the prices more stable because it's a zero sum game at the end of the day. So
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:22.460]   it increases the opportunity to China so that was welcome. I think our sales have like we
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:27.980]   mentioned they have double during Q3 and we've seen some very stable pricing but it
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:33.620]   also increases the competition in the food service segments in the UK.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:41.060]   Okay great. My second question is related to grain and apologies if I missed this in
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.180]   your opening comment I did hear your overview of the market. Could you talk about how your
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.860]   position relative to the market you know are you more hand and mouth at the moment
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:53.660]   do you have any basis secured any color you could offer there on how your position you
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:58.300]   know through the balance of fourth quarter and into next year would be helpful.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.260]   Hey Ben this is Joe thank you for the question. Obviously we've seen prices of corn and soybean
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:08.220]   no increase in the last few months which has been the result of a few factors for corn.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.300]   We've seen a reduction from the supply side with USDA reporting six million fewer planet
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.940]   acres than they originally estimated back in March. We also saw our final stocks for
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:23.220]   2019 ending 200 million bushels less than was expected when the final counting was done.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.380]   On the current crop we actually for the acres of our planet see pretty good yields above
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:32.660]   trend line yields so it's not an issue on the supply side in terms of U.S. production
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.180]   but on the demand side we've also seen much bigger exports demand primarily driven by
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:42.640]   China. Still the USDA is projecting a carrier up carryout of around 2.1 billion bushels
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:47.660]   and that includes a 30% increase in export demand from last year so even if export
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:52.460]   demand ends up higher than what USDA is projecting corn stocks should still be in mind with previous
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.880]   years. On soybeans USDA is projecting a two hundred ninety million bushel carryout which
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.960]   would be the lowest carryout in five years. This projection though includes a 31% increase
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:07.580]   in export demand driven by China. In addition to increase export demand Argentina which
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:12.200]   is one of the world's largest oil seed exporting countries is in the midst of a historic economic
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.820]   crisis which is causing farmers there to hold back available supplies from the market adding
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:22.180]   more pressure to the U.S. to meet this demand. We believe the market is likely to feel anxious
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:26.680]   about U.S. soybean supplies until there's a resolution to this currency situation in
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:32.020]   Argentina or in South South American supplies can be available to meet this demand. In terms
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:36.380]   of how our positions we've always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive to the market
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.380]   conditions and the risks we see and we feel very comfortable with where we are in corn
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:45.060]   and soy we do recognize the risks of soybean supplies in the U.S. and our positions reflect
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:55.840]   that. Okay. Awesome. Thanks and best of luck. Thank you. As a reminder if you have
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:04.620]   a question please press star then one. The next question is from Michael Peacon with
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:09.860]   Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Yeah. Hi. Good morning guys. Just wanted to touch
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:17.340]   face a little bit more in terms of the move I guess into retail and some of that Big Bird
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:23.540]   product is that being chopped up and put into trays and how is that impacting some of the
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:30.260]   margins on the commodity business? Yes, Mike. There's a lot of product from the Big
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:36.980]   Birds especially during promotional seasonality during the summer that from the Big Birds
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:43.660]   end up being put in the tray to be sold in the retailers. We continue to do that. I think
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:49.340]   the challenge to the industry is that we need to have the label available and the facilities
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:55.860]   available to do more of that and that's why the industry has not increased more the production
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:03.420]   to the tray pack as we want for as the demand continues to grow. It's also because of that
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:10.460]   we are increasing the capacity in our Minnesota plant. As of today, yes, we are buying Big
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:16.020]   Bird meat and we continue to put it on a tray especially during Saturdays and I think the
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:22.980]   whole industry is doing that. Okay, great. Then my second question is just looking at
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.980]   the, you mentioned that your absentee rates are starting to go down and you're starting
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:33.260]   to get back to your normal mix. In terms of some of the deboned dark meat, are you starting
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:39.060]   to return that to historic levels and what could that mean for the leg quarter prices
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:44.780]   which is seeing the most pressure? Can that help or is the fact that China is taking more
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:50.020]   poor? Can that help leg quarters? Why haven't leg quarter prices moved if there's more deboned
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:55.740]   dark meat potentially being produced and it seems like at the very least China is taking
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:04.020]   more US poor? Yes, you're right Mike. Because of the absenteeism and also the food service
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:11.280]   industry in the US, the industry produced 3% more leg quarters in July and August than
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:17.140]   the same period last year despite a lower total production. That put a lot of pressure
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:24.060]   in the leg quarter pricing. As we are seeing more the reopening of the food service and
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:29.380]   as we are seeing the absenteeism and the staffing of our clients increasing for us and for the
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:35.780]   whole industry we are seeing more deboning. We are already at levels comparable to last
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:41.100]   year in terms of deboning, which will reduce the pressure in the leg quarters. Of course
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:46.940]   China has been also more active in the leg quarter market over the last month and we
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:54.420]   are seeing that in the leg quarter inventory that was up on a sequentially basis up to
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:42:00.980]   August but we are seeing a reduction and also the inventory today is down 9% compared to
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:07.060]   the peak Q1 average that we have. So those two factors can contribute to the reduction
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:14.220]   in the leg quarter production which is a commodity item as I mentioned and the China interest
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:22.020]   I think we saw over the last weeks, although not today the increase in the oil prices and
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:30.500]   the reduction in the dollar which increase the availability of dollars from the developing
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:36.300]   countries which also increases the demand for leg quarters. So what could help on the
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.600]   leg quarters going forward is both on supply and demand, supply is exactly what you said
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:47.820]   last leg quarters because of the improvement in labor efficiencies and the more sales in
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:53.060]   the domestic market on the food service and on demand because of low prices and because
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:43:06.700]   of more available income in the developing economies.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:12.100]   The next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:18.980]   Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Fabio, just as I am thinking
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:25.040]   about it the small bird and resale channels obviously has been tremendously profitable
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:32.180]   for you guys during this time period and with the plant conversion coming but with commodity
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:38.180]   big bird remaining in the cutout value here remaining under such pressure just at what
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:43.780]   point does it make sense to start talking about converting another plant whether that's
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:49.580]   to retail or to small bird because it just seems like that big bird portion is not going
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:54.980]   to improve without more capacity either being converted or taking out of the market in some
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.980]   capacity.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:02.900]   Sure. Thank you Peter. I think the decision to convert the plant is a more long term decision
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:08.220]   and we always make those decisions combined with our key customer strategy. As we see
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:15.940]   the demand of these key customers growing we take action in our portfolio and that makes
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:22.580]   a lot of sense for us to do that conversion right now from that operation from big bird
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:28.860]   to small bird to support this growth. I think again you need to look into a more broader
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:34.660]   long term perspective. We continue to expect the food service sector to rebound. If you
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:41.200]   look at the food service sector today the food service restaurants are down 13 percent
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.460]   year over year and that is impacting the big bird deboning for sure while the KFRs are
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:54.580]   up 9 percent. As we go to a more normal operations as we see maybe the development of vaccines
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:59.260]   we don't know when that's going to happen or we see more openings of the restaurants
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:07.180]   we expect the food service restaurants especially on the full service to regain some market
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:13.700]   share that they are not operating today. So I think it's a long term decision and it's
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:21.180]   also a very difficult decision to move from big bird to smaller because we have the growers
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:27.520]   and we have the feed mills it's all built to that specific bird. Our plants in the United
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:35.020]   States are really customized to that specific segment so any conversion it really requires
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:43.460]   significant capital and requires some significant changes in the overall supply chain both starting
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:50.820]   from the growers your feed mills and your field operations. So it's a high capital investment
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:56.700]   that needs to be supported for the long run so that's why we don't see a lot of conversions
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:03.860]   in our industry. Of course if this situation continues for a longer period of time you
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:10.200]   can see some conversions. I think also it's important to know that some other players
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.500]   don't have the key customer relationships that we have and moving from the big bird
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:23.260]   to the small bird or to the keys ready require a customer and a key customer to support
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:29.260]   and since they don't have those relationships it's harder for them to do some conversions.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:36.940]   No that's helpful and then maybe just to follow up you know given where the balance
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.460]   sheet is now and something you talked about in your paragraph remarks you know how should
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:47.260]   we think about MNA essential maybe from a geographic perspective or does it make sense
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:53.580]   to get bigger in pork in Europe and you know going into 2021 just any help there and then
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:59.900]   maybe you can also comment on any updates on your CFO search. Thanks very much. Sure
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:04.580]   in terms of strategy I think our strategy continues to save and our growth strategy continues
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:09.180]   in fact and as we mentioned we have a very strong balance sheet. We're looking to increasing
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:17.820]   our prepared foods operation and our branded operation to create a more balanced portfolio
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:23.660]   and we're also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more value from operational
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:31.140]   efficiencies. We're seeing targets both in the US and outside the US geographical diversification
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:38.940]   and to growth in Europe and we will evaluate all alternatives to our value creation standards.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:48.740]   In terms of the CFO we are in the process of finding another CFO we already engage recruiting
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:57.460]   firms and we should have some news in the near future. Great thanks very much guys.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:05.980]   The next question is from Adam Sanderson with Goldman Sachsen Co. Please go ahead.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:13.520]   Yes thank you. Good morning everyone. Morning Adam. Alright so maybe first is the clarification
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.220]   or a little more detail on the expansion of the Minnesota plant for case ready and the
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:26.580]   conversion of the Texas plant to Smallbird from Big Bird. What's the net impact on your
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:32.140]   production volume and what's the capital cost for those projects?
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:38.960]   Yeah in terms of total volume I think we should be just a little bit up. We expect to be
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:45.100]   to grow in line with USDA expectations and the industry for 2021 which is a little bit
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:53.180]   lower than 1%. Yes as we have more birds in Minnesota but we also reduce the weight in
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:58.060]   our operation on the Big Bird that we are transforming into a Smallbird. So we expect
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:06.540]   to be for 2021 in line with those two. In terms of investments it's not very significant
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:16.740]   to our total CAPEX as the conversion of the Smallbird plant it's not it's a simpler conversion
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:23.180]   of course that QSR requires from DSIs which is portioning equipment and some marination
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:28.580]   equipment and we're going to invest in automation in that plant as well. Today is a manual deboning
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:35.580]   operation and we're going to invest in automated deboning. So the investment is close to $20
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:42.660]   to $25 million in that operation and in the case of case ready operation it's close to
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:47.740]   $70 million so overall it is a total of $100 million that we are going to invest in those
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:55.340]   two conversions. Okay that's a helpful call there. The follow up was I just want to make
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:59.040]   sure I heard something right from the paragraph remarks. You talked about the prepared food
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:06.900]   business in the U.S. declining 26% I think is what I heard and maybe hoping to expand
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:11.100]   it on that that's a business that I think has had a few more challenges over the years
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:18.080]   and just do we really just a question of returns of school and food service traffic or how
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:24.620]   do we think about that business from a margin profile moving forward? Yeah that's exactly
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:29.740]   it. We in our prepared food business we have a strong brand which is the Pierce brand that
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:36.060]   is meaning a food service brand. We also are very strong in the school with our Gold
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:43.540]   Keys brand. Both those segments are the ones that are most affected by the COVID-19. The
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:51.860]   noncommercial food service that includes schools were down 66% at Q2 and now they are down
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:57.900]   43%. We are seeing some school reopens which could help but it's a segment that is still
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:03.540]   down 40%. On what we call the commercial food service which is the street business where
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:11.780]   our Pierce brand is a leading brand in wings and in chunks. We saw that in Q2 they end
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:18.980]   up 36% lower than the prior year but they are rebounding and then today they are close
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:25.980]   to 4% lower than the same period last year. So the food service business has been recovering
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:35.220]   and with that our Pierce brand has recovered and our volumes but the school system is still
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:41.740]   close to 40% lower than the prior year and that's why we are investing in more retail
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:49.100]   branded business. As we mentioned our Pierce brand has increased more than 30% and we have
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:54.060]   been very successful in spending the just bear brand from the fresh category but it's
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:52:00.580]   been very successful on the online segment and also on the higher attribute segment in
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.920]   our key customers to the prepared food segment.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:10.020]   All right Chris that's a helpful call and I'll pass it on. Thank you.
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:18.420]   The next question comes from Carla Cazella with City Morgan. Please go ahead.
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:25.240]   Hi my question is regarding your leverage. The three times target, how comfortable or
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:30.020]   how high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional M&A and are you
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:36.580]   seeing any more M&A opportunities just given the volatility in worldwide protein market?
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:44.660]   Yeah thank you Carla. We set this target of two to three times because it's the best
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:53.040]   capital structure that can protect and reduce our interest payments while not creating any
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:53:00.420]   problem for our bonds and for our leverage. The two to three times is in normal operations
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:07.540]   of course during some acquisition. If we have a great plan on how to reduce that back we
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:15.580]   can go further. I don't think there is a number that is specific or on where we go. I think
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:22.260]   it's more about what is the plan to leverage and of course the plan to leverage could include
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:27.700]   the issue of stock and that's why Pilgrims as a public traded company has that opportunity
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:33.660]   to use the stock as a currency not increase the leverage two points where we don't think
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:41.860]   it is prudent in the case of significant acquisition that will be transformational for the company.
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:43.820]   Okay and just one last point.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:49.260]   No sorry in terms of M&A we are seeing more targets. Of course the whole situation about
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:56.940]   traveling has created some challenges in terms of seeing and visiting assets but we are seeing
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:03.980]   some targets that are still very interesting to us and to create a lot of value for our
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:04.980]   shareholders.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:12.380]   Okay great and just in the event that JBS is able to list the U.S. business would that
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.060]   cause any need for changing your structure?
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:21.900]   Yeah we don't believe so. I think JBS has said many times that they continue to support
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:27.340]   Pilgrims to be a public traded company and just as I mentioned it is a great way for
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:34.420]   us to keep our growth. We can use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:40.180]   and transformational event for Pilgrims.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:45.460]   Okay thank you.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:55:06.460]   Well thank you all we would like to reiterate our continued commitment to our valued team
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:11.500]   members to provide them with a safe and healthy working environment while supporting our duty
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:16.500]   to maintain food production and supply to customers. We are looking forward to closing
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:23.060]   2020 with good results in spite of the volatility. Our diverse portfolio of differentiated products
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:28.220]   tailored to support our key customer strategy. In conjunction with our broad geographic footprint
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:33.660]   we continue to generate consistent performance and minimize margin volatility in challenging
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:38.580]   marketing conditions relative to competitors. We will continue to seek new growth potential
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:43.380]   both organically and through acquisitions while offering even more differentiated products
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:48.060]   for portfolio within our business to support key customers needs by cultivating a culture
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:53.500]   of constant innovation. We would like to thank everyone in the Pilgrims family including
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:57.940]   our family farm partners, suppliers and our customers who make our business possible.
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:07.300]   As always we appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you for joining us today.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:11.340]   Ladies and gentlemen the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.300]   presentation. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   >> Welcome to the Eversource Energy Q3 2020 Results Conference call.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.040]   My name is John and I'll be over here for today's call.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.020]   At this time, all participants are in this only mode.
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.900]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.280]   During the question and answer session, if you do have a question, press star then 1
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.480]   on your touch phone phone.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.240]   Please note that this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.660]   And I want to turn the call over to Jeffrey Cotton.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.200]   >> Thank you very much John.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.160]   Good morning and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.080]   I'm Jeff Cotton, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.420]   During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website.
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.240]   And as you can see on slide one, some of the statements made during this investor call may
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.120]   be forward looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.040]   of the U.S. private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.840]   The forward looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.800]   to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.780]   for forecast and projections.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.120]   These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.480]   Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.360]   to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10(k) for the year ended December 31st,
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.300]   2019 and our Form 10(k) for the three months ended June 30th, 2020.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.520]   Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAP measures
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.020]   and how those measures reconcile to GAP results is contained within our news release
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.120]   and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10(k).
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.800]   Seeking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.640]   Also joining us today are Joe Nolan, our Executive Vice President
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600]   for strategy, customer and corporate relations.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.280]   John Marrera, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.260]   and Jay Booth, our Controller.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.680]   Now I will turn slide two and turn over the call to Phil.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.080]   >> Thank you, Jeff.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.820]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.220]   I hope everyone on the call remains healthy
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.760]   and that these families are safe and doing well.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.000]   This morning I'll cover a variety of areas and review the results
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.080]   of the third quarter, discuss recent regulatory developments including the acquisition
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.460]   of the assets of Columbia GAPs of Massachusetts and provide an update
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.660]   on recent developments around our offshore wind partnership with [inaudible].
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.020]   I'll start with slide two, noting that recurring earnings were $1.02 per share
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.720]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of 98 cents per share
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.260]   in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.540]   GAP results, which include a charge of $1 per share relating
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.720]   to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia GAPs
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.920]   of Massachusetts, told $1.01 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.080]   In the first nine months of 2020, recurring earnings excluding Columbia GAP acquisition
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.440]   costs total $2.80 per share compared with recurring earnings of $2.69 per share
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.580]   in the first nine months of 2019
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.180]   and excluding the Northern Path transmission impairment charge.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.360]   GAP results for September of this year were $2.76 per share.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.200]   Joining our business segments, our electric distribution segment earned $0.60 per share
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.900]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.340]   of 2019.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.760]   The low earnings were results of both higher storm restoration costs
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.640]   and property tax expense as well as the impact of sub-share dilution.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.620]   Our electric transmission segment earned $0.36 per share
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.400]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.600]   of $0.33 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.420]   Improved results were driven by the continued investment and reliability
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.560]   in F transmission facilities partially offset by shared dilution.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.100]   Our gas distribution segment lost $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.860]   with a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of last year.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.700]   Improved results were due to higher revenues.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.780]   I should note that because we didn't close on our acquisition
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.580]   of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets until October 9th,
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.120]   the transaction had no impact on this gas segment,
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.260]   the segment during the quarter.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.020]   Each quarter this year, we booked acquisition related costs
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.740]   at the parent and have segregated them for increased transparency.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.620]   Beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, ongoing results
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.220]   of our new gas franchise which is named Eversource Gas Company
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.640]   of Massachusetts will be reflected in the natural gas segment.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.000]   Integration related costs, however, will continue to be recorded separately
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.080]   at the parent and excluded from our recurring gas earnings.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.840]   Our water distribution segment earned $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.520]   with earnings of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.180]   Improved results were due to a $3.5 million after tax gain on the sale
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.400]   of our Hena Massachusetts area facilities to the town.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.300]   Eversource parent earned $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020,
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.220]   excluding the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts asset acquisition cost equal
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.840]   to our earnings in the third quarter of last year.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.220]   As you probably noted in our earnings reliefs and can see on slide three,
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:30.460]   we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings per share guidance of $3.60 to $3.70
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.760]   and it is excluding the non-recurring costs related to the purchase
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.520]   of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.580]   We are also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.040]   from our core regulated business through the year 2024.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.680]   We continue to be, to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.040]   Largely due to the investments we need to make on behalf of our customers
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.960]   as we outlined for you earlier in the year.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.900]   As a reminder, while we fully expect the Columbia Gas assets to be accreted
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:16.500]   to our earnings per share starting immediately in 2021, we have not yet updated our long-term
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.280]   financial outlook to reflect the acquisition of Columbia Gas assets
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.440]   in our capital, our cap assets that are our earnings growth.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.780]   In addition, as we disclosed previously, earnings from offshore wind would be incremental
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.220]   to our core business growth.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:40.100]   We'll provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecasts adding
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.500]   in every Swiss gas company in Massachusetts projections and provide an update
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.880]   of our offshore wind partnership during our year-end call in late February.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.780]   From the third quarter results, I'll turn to slide four and our experience restoring power
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.920]   after tropical storm ETAEAS ravaged Connecticut on October 4th.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.820]   We serve 149 cities and towns in Connecticut and every one
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.860]   of these communities suffered damage from ETAEAS, much of it catastrophic.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.460]   As you can see on the slide, we had nearly 22,000 damage locations
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.840]   that we had to address and brought in an army
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.640]   of electric restoration and tree crews to restore power,
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.320]   all the while working on the restoration in a pandemic setting.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.760]   The restoration process lasted nine days, meaning we completed our work one
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.500]   to two days faster than we had in the last two tropical storms that hit Connecticut even
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.660]   though we had 30 to 35 percent more damage locations.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:55.500]   And most importantly, we completed that work safely with no serious electrical contact
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.060]   and no COVID exposure among the enormous work force we brought to Connecticut.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:07.680]   Just a tremendous effort by all of our employees from across all parts of every source.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:16.120]   At this time, we estimate that deferred costs across all three states will total more
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:23.140]   than $275 million with the vast majority of that sum incurred in Connecticut.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:29.000]   That figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.320]   We're still actively pursuing invoices from hundreds of vendors
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.180]   that assisted us during the statewide restoration effort.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.900]   Where we were setting new poles or hanging miles of new wires or replacing hundreds
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.960]   of trans-performants, these related costs ought to be capitalized.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:54.520]   The ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation of performance in safely
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.100]   and expeditiously restoring power to our customers is pending an ongoing review
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.400]   by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or PURRA.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:10.920]   That review is scheduled to be completed in late April of 2021.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.320]   Sticking with our regulated business, I'll turn to Slide 5
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.620]   in a review of this year's distribution rate reviews.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.800]   This past Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities issued its decision
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   in the NSTAR GAS rate review that we filed last year.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.160]   It supports our continued investment in the NSTAR GAS system
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.580]   on behalf of our 300,000 customers.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.660]   The decision allows NSTAR GAS to increase distribution revenues
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.520]   by $23 million on an annualized basis.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.020]   The DPU approves an ROE of 9.9% and a capital structure
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.100]   with 54.77% equity.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:02.180]   It also permits us to implement performance-based rate making for a 10-year term
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:08.540]   that with sounds operating performance by NSTAR GAS will target annual
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.260]   base rate increases of inflation plus 1.03%.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.220]   This is an earnings sharing mechanism that would return 75%
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:24.340]   of the benefit to customers should we see the ROE of 10.9% and a sharing mechanism
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.680]   on the DAB side if our ROE falls below 8.4%.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:34.580]   Also exciting is the decision also approves our first ever geothermal pilot program.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.020]   Our other long-standing rate proceeding involves public service in New Hampshire.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.080]   In New Hampshire last month we and all the parties
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.660]   to the PSNH rate case filed a proposed settlement in the rate review
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.380]   that is pending for nearly, you know, a year and a half.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:57.660]   You can see from the slide, we settled on a $45 million annualized rate increase
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:05.660]   that includes a 9.3% return on equity and a 54.4% equity layer.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.260]   Should regulators approve the settlement, the permanent increase would take effect in January,
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.460]   January 1st of 2021.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.980]   You may recall that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission allowed us
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:29.120]   to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately $28 million back in July, July 1st of 2019.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.620]   The final approved rates would be retroactive back to that date, 18 months.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:41.280]   We would -- we cover that in a true up over the course of the year 2021.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.220]   We can settle -- consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:53.000]   to PSNH's first general increase in about a decade and have asked the New Hampshire PUC
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.120]   to approve the settlement before the end of November.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:04.000]   From the rate review, reviews, I'll turn to slide 6 and our recently completed acquisition
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.360]   of the assets of Columbia Gas and Massachusetts for $1.1 billion
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.080]   of cash excluding working capital adjustments.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.240]   Most of these assets were signed to Emerson West Gas Company in Massachusetts,
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.480]   a new subsidiary I mentioned that we formed in May of 2020.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.440]   As you can see on the slide, much of Emerson West Gas
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.000]   as service territory is adjacent to end star gas or Yankee gas service territories.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.360]   Additionally, end star electric already provides electric service to about 20
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.960]   of the communities that Emerson West Gas serves with natural gas.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:49.140]   As a result, we expect to realize operational benefits for our newest 330,000 natural gas customers
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.280]   and the communities where they live.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:14:00.360]   To finance the transaction, we sold approximately $500 million of equity in June
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.260]   and we financed the death portion of the transaction in August.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.400]   And again, we are very confident that this transaction will be accretive
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.820]   to our earnings per share in 2021 and incrementally accretive in the years ahead.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.880]   A critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.060]   to all stakeholders is an eight-year rate plan that we negotiated
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:28.100]   with the Massachusetts Attorney General and other key parties prior to our filing
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.200]   with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   The key elements of that plan are listed on slide seven.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.700]   It will allow us to make the necessary investments in our Emerson West gas
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.940]   of mass system and reflect those investments and rates in a reasonably timely manner.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.100]   We're thankful that the DPU approved the settlement
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.600]   and the acquisition very quickly.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.160]   Now that we have the keys to the property and a long-term plan in place,
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.900]   we are focused on providing our new Emerson West gas customers with the same high level
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:06.300]   of service that we provide our other 550,000 national gas distribution company customers
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.180]   that we have in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:14.440]   As I noted earlier, we plan to integrate Emerson West gas
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:20.140]   of Massachusetts into our updated 5D projections that we'll provide you in February.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.740]   We continue to project approximately $3 billion of regulated company capital investments this year.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:33.900]   Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and the need to take crews off of capital projects
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.440]   for a significant part of August to deal with the aftermath of tropical stormy Saiz.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:46.240]   Through September, our capital investments totaled approximately $2.2 billion.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:52.180]   That's approximately the same level as this time last year in 2019.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.200]   We made considerable progress on our transmission capital program
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.900]   in the third quarter, putting several projects into service at or below budget.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:08.820]   These benefits of lower cost will slow through to New England's electric customers.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:15.860]   From the regulated business, I'll turn to offshore wind partnership with Orsted on slide 8.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.760]   We've had a few developments since our July 31st earnings call.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:28.000]   The most significant development was that in August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.180]   posted a complete review schedule for our 130 megawatts south fork project on Long Island.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.880]   The schedule culminates in a decision on a construction
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:46.380]   and operations permit or COP as it's known in mid-January of 2022.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.280]   We are also making progress on the other permits.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.900]   In September, we filed a settlement proposal with the New York Department of Public Service
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:01.740]   to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the construction operations
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.000]   and maintenance of the project that lies within New York jurisdiction.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.940]   In October, several of New York State agencies signaled their support
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.860]   for this proposal by signing on to the agreement.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.460]   We've structured an agreement on host community payments
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.760]   in the necessary real estate rights with the town of East Hampton
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.000]   where the offshore cable will land and will be connected to the Long Island grid.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.040]   New York Public Service Commission citing hearings
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.780]   for south fork is scheduled to commence the first week of December.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:45.140]   We continue to expect the state signing process to be completed in 2021 before bone issues the COP.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:52.100]   Based on that schedule, we now expect the project end to service in the fourth quarter of 2023.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:58.500]   This is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our May and July earnings calls
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.520]   while we were still waiting for the review schedule.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:10.460]   Joining to our other projects, you recall that we filed our bone application for Revolution Wind in March.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:17.160]   We expect bone to establish a review schedule for that project in the first quarter of 2021.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:24.380]   We do not expect to provide an updated in-service date for this project until the schedule is issued,
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:31.620]   but at this point it is unlikely that the project will end this service by the end of 2023.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:39.120]   Also, we filed our sunrise wind application with bone on September 1st and expect bone
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.220]   to establish a review schedule for the project next year.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:49.700]   Once we receive that review schedule, we'll be able to better estimate a more up to date in-service schedule.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:55.260]   But again, at this time it would seem that the end of '24 in service is not likely.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:01.540]   We're very optimistic about our offshore wind business and expect to have many opportunities
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:07.840]   over the coming months and years to expand our offshore wind partnership beyond the 1700
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.340]   and 14 megawatts currently under contract.
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:17.420]   As we mentioned before, we have enough leaf capacity to construct at least 4,000 megawatts
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:22.680]   on the 550 square miles of ocean tracks that we have under long-term leaf
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.580]   off the southeast coast of Massachusetts.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:33.080]   To this point, on October 20th, we submitted a number of alternative bids
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:38.180]   into the second New York offshore wind IRSP where the state is looking
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.760]   for between 1,000 and 2,500 megawatts.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.700]   New York State officials have indicated that they expect
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.360]   to announce the winners before the end of the year.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:56.020]   Our sunrise project as a reminder won the largest portion
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:00.400]   of New York's first IRSP last year, 880 megawatts.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.400]   Additionally, just last week Rhode Island Governor Gina Romando announced
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.860]   that her state will target early next year for issuing an IRSP
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.260]   to 600 megawatts of additional offshore wind.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:21.940]   As you know, the majority of our revolution wind capacity 400 megawatts will be sold
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.000]   to Rhode Island with the balance going to Connecticut.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.400]   Thank you very much for joining us this morning
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.580]   and I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.760]   >> Thanks Phil and I'll turn the call back to John just to remind you how
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.280]   to enter questions in the Q&A queue.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.440]   >> Thank you.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.600]   If you do have a question, press star then 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.840]   Once again, that's star then 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.880]   If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   >> Thank you John.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.240]   Our first question this morning is from Shah from Guggenheim.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.440]   Good morning Shah.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.120]   >> Good morning Jeff.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.720]   Good morning Phil.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.420]   >> Good morning Shah.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.120]   >> So a couple questions here.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.720]   Just some of your language around sort of the growth rate, you know obviously
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.640]   which still excludes Columbia gas and offshore wind.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.180]   Obviously these are, you know, very creative and you're already conservatively kind
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.200]   of well within your band so should we sort of be thinking
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.360]   about these incremental items as potentially rating your growth rate
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.460]   to maybe 6% to 8% or something that will hit you to the top end and then sort
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.340]   of extend that runway with your current trajectory.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:42.080]   I mean the reason we ask is 6% to 8% seems to be sort of that new top quartile bucket
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.240]   in our space where 5% to 7% is becoming a little bit more typical.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.880]   So here's how you're sort of thinking about this.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.120]   Do you see value to be in the top quartile or you don't think you need to reward it for it?
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.840]   So curious on that as we think about you layering its plan.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.340]   >> Sure, sure thanks for the question and I hope you guys are doing well.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:13.260]   Certainly the addition of Columbia gas and will be additive to our existing forecast
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.000]   so we're working through all the details of that so we're able to provide you
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.040]   with a full update in February but we expect
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:30.480]   to get significant benefit from that franchise and to say we also expect
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:36.580]   as those offshore wind projects come online to also be additive.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:43.040]   To remind folks I know I said it but and you did that the 5% to 7% growth rate is
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:49.160]   from the existing core business which doesn't include Columbia assets.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:56.600]   It also doesn't include you know grid modernization activities that are currently pending
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:07.740]   in Connecticut and New Hampshire or AMI that could be a potential to move forward relatively soon
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:13.000]   in Massachusetts in terms of taking a look at that by the regulator.
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:21.620]   So I see that we have a number of levers to grow and grow at even a higher rate
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.820]   than we expected before.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:30.480]   >> Got it, that's helpful and then just lastly for me is can you just maybe talk a little bit
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.460]   about your expectations for the legislation in Connecticut?
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.900]   I mean the legislation that passed was more constructive than the draft legislation
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.500]   but obviously some disappointment with the refunds and penalties offset
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.740]   by the potential offset from like PBRs.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.480]   So sort of how are you guys thinking about this in terms of?
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.860]   >> Sure the energy legislation we've said consistently
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:02.540]   that PBR is a formula and a template that we think is effective.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:11.780]   We have PBR structures in other states and we think that having a robust discussion
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.620]   on PBR in Connecticut makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.480]   So we're very supportive of that provision.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:25.540]   You know really you know the energy legislation directed Pura to evaluate
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:32.300]   that and open a docket by the middle of next year so June of 2021
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.900]   and it authorizes Pura to you know establish storm standards
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:45.020]   and potential penalties as you mentioned there is an increased potential of penalties.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.420]   Currently those penalties are two and a half percent
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:55.520]   of our distribution revenues in Connecticut and that goes up to 4 percent.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.900]   So you know it also gives Pura some additional time you know to review cases
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.880]   so you know which is also something that you know seems to be appropriate.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:13.260]   So the legislation as you indicated is out there and Pura is working through the details
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.260]   of it and we expect to be working through that
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.140]   in a constructive way with them over the next several months.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.740]   >> Got it terrific that's all I had today thanks guys.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:31.540]   >> All right thanks Shah our next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe good morning Steve.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.540]   >> Good morning.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.900]   Phil can you hear me?
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.660]   >> Yes Steve I can.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:47.700]   >> Yeah great so just a question on the delays in your offshore wind projects could you maybe talk
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:55.260]   to I know we don't know the exact timing but how should we think about the impact
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:03.260]   on the economics of those projects from delay or puts and takes
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.900]   and is it hurting the economics of the projects you already have signed up too?
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:14.820]   >> Yeah thanks Steve question and I hope you and your family are doing well.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:24.140]   I guess to go to the puts and takes piece you know I don't think that folks should automatically
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:30.540]   think that schedule changes result in ups or downs there's some benefits
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:35.300]   or that people may not consider in that.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:42.140]   So certainly if you are looking at adjusted schedules you might be able
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:51.320]   to adjust your installation vessel optimization better you know determining sizes themselves
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:59.460]   or getting larger so you could move to larger turbine sizes if projects are due
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:06.780]   at a later time period versus an earlier time period and certainly the cost supply chain
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:11.060]   and availability of materials and supply chain is only getting better.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.900]   So I would say that you know there's opportunities
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:23.660]   for improved cost economics as you move into a schedule that you may not think of
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.980]   and I think people generally think of projects as you know if it's a delay it's a cost increase
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:36.980]   but there are other elements that work here on the offshore wind business that offset that.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.100]   >> How about any negatives?
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.540]   Is it how about like do you lose, are you going to lose any tax credits or anything else?
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.180]   >> Yeah certainly--
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.980]   >> Like it's just time value?
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:52.540]   >> Yeah, in terms of the schedules we're looking at we don't expect
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:59.780]   to have any impact on our tax assumptions but certainly significant delays,
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.180]   delays could have impacts on your tax assumption,
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:09.180]   delays could also have impacts on contrast that you have with counterparties
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:17.220]   but in our specific case so that's the general case, in our specific case we're confident
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.020]   that we have the ability to work within both of those, the tax area
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:31.320]   and the contract area in an effective way with where we see the schedules going in the future.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:31.980]   >> Okay.
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.660]   >> Thank you.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.580]   >> Thank you.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.860]   >> Our next question is from Angie from Seaport Global.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.340]   Good morning Angie.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.820]   >> Good morning.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.700]   So I have a question about Massachusetts.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:51.460]   You guys have this very constructive decision for ENSAR gas
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:57.420]   but the state is clearly looking up to the future of gas LDCs
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.420]   and so how do you guys see it especially in light of the fact
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:08.260]   that you just acquired an additional gas utility and Massachusetts?
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:14.300]   >> Good morning Angie and thank you for your question and hope you're doing well.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:21.340]   You know the way that I would position it or the way that I think people should think
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:27.580]   about it is that there's nobody first of all who's more aggressive in terms of looking
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.180]   at clean energy strategies and carbon reduction and every source in terms
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:38.740]   of having carbon neutral goals like 2030 we have worked effectively with all parties
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:44.980]   in all states but in Massachusetts where the Attorney General and others want
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:53.780]   to take a look at you know sort of the future or the outlook in terms of the gas business.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:59.500]   We've been working with these intervening parties for many years and we'll continue
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.220]   to work with them on what we think an appropriate strategy is there.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:12.180]   So this is a long-term outlook in terms of that the state wants
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:20.260]   to you know have aggressive clean energy and carbon reduction targets with wholly supportive
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.860]   of that and we look forward to working you know with all the parties there.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:34.140]   But we don't see it as a threat to the gas distribution business in the region at all.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:40.140]   >> Okay and in Connecticut you know there's this recent back
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:45.300]   and forth between you guys and Pora about the expansion of the lack
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:50.420]   of basically disconnections on the back of COVID.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.820]   I mean it sounds a bit concerning that Pora is pushing back so strong
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.620]   that they don't need to sign off on that extension.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.180]   I mean I would assume that it's an actual practice,
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.300]   normal practice for a regulated utility to seek recovery
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.900]   of these you know under recovered revenues.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:13.940]   I mean can you give us a sense you know how you see it in Connecticut given
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:19.020]   the latest you know legislative changes and also some deterioration
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.820]   and you know regular relationships in the state.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:31.940]   >> Yes so we are not doing shutoffs across all any of our franchises at this point
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.180]   and specifically you know we're working, you know we're working with customers.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:43.100]   We're working with fuel agencies, assistance agencies on an approach here
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.460]   that works, don't work best for customers.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:52.900]   We've also engaged with Pura as you mentioned and other government officials
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:58.300]   you know on this issue so I'm confident that we'll get to a good place here.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:04.300]   You know nobody wants to burden customers with any more than we're all ready,
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:10.060]   all of us are burdened with in terms of the economic conditions and COVID et cetera.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:15.460]   So we're working through the issue, we're working with customers as I say
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:23.900]   and some of the assistance agencies and I'm sure we'll get to a good outcome here.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.020]   >> Very good, thank you.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.540]   >> Thank you Angie.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.140]   Next question is from Julian from Bank of America.
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.100]   Good morning Julian.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.340]   >> Hey good morning team thanks for the time.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.700]   I hope all of you are doing well and safe families as well.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:45.500]   Perhaps just to pick up off of us or perhaps clarify if I can some of the last round of questions.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:51.140]   When you talk about the 4Q roll forward are you going to be rolling to 2025
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:56.340]   and then more specifically how do you think about including or excluding offshore wind
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.540]   in light of the uncertainty described?
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.860]   Should we expect that offshore wind should continue to be at least for those projects
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:08.060]   where there's an undetermined date to continue to be excluded there?
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.500]   >> Julian thanks for your question and your comment
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.060]   and I hope you and your family are doing well too.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:21.900]   Just to clarify we will -- our history has been to add another year into the outlook
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:28.020]   so 2025 would be that year since our forecast goes through the 2024 time period
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.620]   so that is something that you should expect to see.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:39.780]   And really our view on how to look at offshore wind it doesn't change by any of the schedule items
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:47.500]   we talked about today or we've looked at it as showing the core business
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:53.100]   as the driver and the foundational element of the growth rate
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:58.060]   and then to show that wind is attitude to that in what way.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.580]   So that would be the intent going forward.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:08.740]   I think that when I've been asked this question before the answer is was and still is
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:15.220]   as more years of wind come in to the actual results of that particular year
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:19.180]   then to me it makes more sense to roll it all together.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:25.540]   But at this stage the expectation especially in this upcoming February update
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:31.060]   would be to have the core business extend that through 2025
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:37.860]   and then show offshore wind in addition to that.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.540]   >> And if you don't mind elaborating a little bit further
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.900]   I know that there's a certain degree of uncertainty on exactly the permming schedule
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.420]   that inhibits your ability to say one of these projects in a recent service
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:53.420]   can you at least try to put some more parameters around what each of these pieces
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:57.060]   of the process could take such that there's like a window if you will
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.860]   it may be too early?
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:09.380]   >> Yeah so in terms of people have realized out there and we've been asked questions
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:16.100]   I think you've asked us the questions in terms of with delays on vineyard wind
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:23.580]   and other things there's been some delays in terms of bone notice of intent
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:30.340]   and to prepare their environmental impact statement and frankly we would have expected
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:36.540]   in our original schedule schedules that some of these NOIs
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:41.380]   to prepare the environmental impact statement would be out by now.
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:51.260]   So these are expected I believe the plan schedule for reviewing and releasing these is underway
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.740]   so I wouldn't expect significant change in the schedule
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:03.340]   but at this stage it would be prudent to wait to see the schedule that comes out of the bone
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:08.780]   before we commit to a final in-service date.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.180]   I wouldn't expect it to be significant.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:17.900]   >> Got it excellent all right I'll pass it from there thank you so much Steve.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:24.660]   >> Thanks Julian next question is from Dergash from Evercore good morning Dergash.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:30.660]   >> Hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question just just following up on you know
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:38.300]   the offshore wind here what do you expect you know there's this EIS decision I suppose
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:43.820]   that is going to be out or EIS tape and rather this month or early December
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:51.020]   what do you expect there and then how does that impact your future project timelines?
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:58.260]   >> Yeah the you've noticed a bit of intent that they contain a plan schedule you know
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:04.020]   that in those NOIs they have contained bones plan schedule for reviewing each
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:10.260]   of the costs so that would be an important piece of information to have available
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:16.180]   so that's really the what's included in that it's a plan schedule for reviewing
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:21.660]   the cost that comes out with the notice of it intense.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.780]   >> All right so I guess maybe I'm talking about the environmental impact statement
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:30.260]   isn't there an environmental impact statement that bone is supposed to sort of put out here
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:34.380]   in the next few weeks?
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.940]   >> You're talking about the one for Vineyard right?
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.420]   >> Yes yes yes.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:48.780]   >> Okay yeah I apologize you probably have to ask Vineyard Wind on about that.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:53.220]   >> Okay but that doesn't have a read through for you or your offshore wind project
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:57.260]   I guess that's what my question was.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:03.500]   >> Well certainly all of the developers off the coast you know that we've been going
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:11.540]   through this cumulative impact study and looking at spacing and of wind turbines
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:17.940]   and we came up with a one nautical mile by one nautical mile spacing so certainly
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:24.380]   there could be components that come out in any decision for Vineyard Wind that you'd
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:29.660]   have to you know take a look at see if it has any impacts you know to all the developers
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:37.820]   including us but in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing I think Vineyard
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.900]   might might have a better perspective of that.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.500]   >> Okay perfect that's all I had guys thank you so much.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.340]   >> All right thanks Dorgash.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:52.620]   Next question is from Jeremy from J.P. Morgan good morning Jeremy.
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.980]   >> Good morning thanks for having me.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.700]   Just wanted to start off with what are the benefits of looping ConEd into the proposed
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:05.140]   sunrise to sunrise wind to RFP here.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.420]   Every source has the experience of building transmission and we're curious what additional
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:14.100]   competitive advantage is ConEd provides here to this specific project.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:19.100]   Can you provide details on potential ownership interests for each entity and does ownership
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:24.540]   interest change once construction is complete and the project is in service?
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.420]   >> Thanks for your question Jeremy I hope you're doing well.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:35.620]   I guess I would say on the first part of the question that sort of obviously ConEd has
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:42.700]   local knowledge of New York and their service territory and the network and the operation
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:52.340]   of the transmission and delivery system that are valuable to any party if you're operating
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:40:00.700]   in New York so I say they bring a knowledge and skill set of the area that certainly we
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:10.740]   don't have as depth a knowledge as they would so the skill sets there as a local player
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:19.580]   would bring so in terms of you know what the components of the relationship would be those
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:26.540]   things are all to be discussed as we move through but it certainly beneficial I think
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:39.260]   to the project and have somebody with ConEd skill sets involved.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:43.420]   And as far as potential ownership interest is there any kind of thoughts on how that
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.500]   could develop?
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.540]   >> Not at this time no.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:56.340]   >> Got it and then will the delay and offshore wind permitting have any impact on the current
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.340]   minting plans?
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:02.060]   Is it fair to assume the 700 million of equity and your current private plan moves to the
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.980]   back end here and how is offshore wind catbacks spending track feeder date versus the three
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:14.260]   to 400 million range that you expected?
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:20.660]   >> We haven't disclosed a range that we've expected we've talked about how much we expected
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:30.660]   to spend you know this year you know just for the year 2020 and it's tracking somewhat
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:38.140]   close that I say is probably a little bit under what we expected at this time in terms
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:46.020]   of the financing you're right that we announced a year ago you know the $2 billion of equity
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:54.500]   need that would support the forecast and we issued 1.3 of that so the 700 million remaining
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:42:02.460]   that and I would say the same thing as I said all along as we'd be opportunistic and consider
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:08.580]   what our capital forecast are and what the market conditions are you know as we look
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:14.500]   to fulfill the rest of that offering that we discussed.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.380]   >> Got it that's helpful I'll leave it there thank you.
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:25.660]   >> Thanks Jeremy next question is from Paul Patterson from Glen Rock good morning Paul.
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:33.820]   >> Good morning guys good morning Paul I just wanted to follow up on the draft decision
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:43.220]   in Connecticut on Monday and what your thoughts were on it if it were in fact to become a final
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:49.020]   order what the what the potential impact could be.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:55.420]   >> Are you talking about the draft information on rates or what can you be most specific?
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:03.980]   >> Sure there was a draft decision on Monday in the per case associated with the rates
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:11.620]   right the rate review that was reversed that proceeding I can tell you that the specific
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.620]   name.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:18.740]   >> That's okay I just wanted to I just wanted to be specific because as somebody else mentioned
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.980]   there's been a number of different.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.940]   >> Yeah I can measure a lot.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:32.380]   >> So as you recall the purest suspended the rates that we had implemented over the summer
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:38.740]   both we and UI to take an additional look I think this is what you're referring to so
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:44.460]   we did receive the draft order and really it's kind of hot off the press we're currently
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:51.100]   evaluating that and and we're going to you know see what comments we might have and comments
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:57.820]   on the draft could do I think it's the 12th of November so we have some time to flush
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:07.260]   out anything but it's consistent with on first blush I'd say it's consistent with pure desire
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:13.940]   to have some rate changes you know move instead of implementing rates at peak times of usage
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:20.060]   maybe such as July implement them on you know change the timing of it to implement it maybe
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:27.380]   in a in a shoulder month like as like May or something and move to annual reconciliations
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:37.700]   as opposed to semi-annual so this would you know it is it is delayed this could have
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:43.500]   effectively this is a cash flow item and it could have an impact on our deferrals that
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:49.060]   we have in place there but you know I think it generally is consistent with the desire
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:54.260]   as we said to move off of these peak periods for making rate changes in the shoulder periods
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:45:00.660]   and see what we go from there but we're we're we're actively reviewing that last night
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:07.740]   and today and we will be and have any comments that we would have do as I said on the 12th
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:15.940]   okay there was one part of it that would reduce the carrying charges from the from lack to
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:25.160]   a prime rate on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms is there any do we have any I know
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:30.460]   this is off the press and everything but do we have any sort of forecast as to what the
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:37.660]   those reconciliation mechanisms like how much capital might be tied up in those no that you
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:47.900]   did that there is a point to the carrying cost at Prime which is consistent in some
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:57.020]   of the jurisdiction I guess so no that it's not a significant you know item but it certainly
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:03.340]   one that pure had put out there in the draft is to recover deferred balances with a with
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:13.060]   a prime prime rate versus a a lack okay and then just we don't know who the president
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:18.660]   going to be at things but if there was a change in administration do you think that could
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:26.180]   have or not have maybe a significant impact on the OEM permitting process with respect
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:35.860]   to offer win the the permitting process I mean when when we meet with with phone the
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:42.380]   OEM you know the the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management you know that people are active
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:48.860]   we're actively working we're actively having you know Zoom meetings or teams calls or whatever
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:58.880]   the video capabilities are that we're using but you know we're actively working that and
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:06.340]   I can assure you that the people in the agencies are working full speed regardless of you know
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:12.140]   who's you know president or what the election results are but certainly it would be good
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:20.620]   to have you know the results of the election I think we've all as a country you know that
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:25.460]   the election results are something that we've all targeted out there and wherever you fall
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:31.500]   on the political spectrum it's good to have certainty as opposed uncertainty so I think
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:37.100]   we're all looking forward to what the final outcome is there so we can we can move forward
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:43.620]   okay let's just so it just for my clarity the process of the BOEM is pretty much the
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:48.740]   agency that the sort of bureaucratic process that's going on really you don't see a significant
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:53.740]   change one way or the other it regardless of the outcome of the presidential election
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:48:00.300]   is that the right understanding that yeah I say that the work at the agencies is going
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:07.760]   on you know there you know we've been meeting regularly going through questions we're working
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:15.420]   through the various state agencies so no I say that the work is continuing at the as
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:24.100]   you say the bureaucrat level okay awesome thanks so much you all thanks Paul next question
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:30.720]   is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse good morning Mike Hey good morning Morning
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:37.180]   Phil good morning Mike good hope you're hope you're doing well hey maybe you could just
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:44.700]   give a quick two second update on what you think the outcome at FERC might be for transmission
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:50.420]   ROEs you know considering I don't know if the election outcome may has any effect on
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:59.540]   any of this accelerating an outcome well Mike that's a very big crystal ball that you're
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:07.700]   asking so but again thanks and I hope you're doing well thanks for your question I you
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:15.860]   know it I wish I had a you know a better answer than to say that you know it's working its
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:26.100]   way through we don't really have a specific clarity as to when FERC might you know come
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:33.740]   up with something on the New England the fourth pending New England cases and certainly impact
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:39.180]   of the election one way or the other what what that could have in terms of commissioners
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:45.220]   and that type of thing so you know the only thing I know for certain is where we're looking
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:56.820]   at our 10.57 rates and I'm observing to that level and an 11.74 cap and you know we'll
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:01.740]   just have to wait and see what the final the final outcome we'll we'll look at but I don't
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:08.300]   really have a any answer I know in years past when I try to when I tried to think that one
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:13.860]   was coming or it was going a certain way it really hasn't materialized so I think it's
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:18.500]   best to wait for the final the final order comes out at this point on board or as it
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:26.180]   is it may be right hey and bigger crystal ball question would be you know I know that
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:33.220]   Hydro Quebec has a pretty big long-term construction plan for you know hydro generation up there
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:38.140]   and I know that their long-term plans included lots and lots of northern past type transmission
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:44.900]   lines you know do you think there's ever a time at some point where there might be another
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.200]   of another whack or another go at transmission at some point you know big transmission project
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:55.420]   I think a lot of that is dependent upon what the states want to get right so this these
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:51:01.300]   are going to be processes now that are driven by states clean energy policies and the states
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:14.300]   desire to have either offshore wind or solar or hydro in the mix so you know there are
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:20.500]   certainly there's a lot of activity at the states now I mean the states in our area
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:26.780]   all want aggressive carbon reduction targets so we wouldn't be out of the question to see
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:33.720]   a state you know want to you know contract for more of that but there's nothing there's
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:38.860]   nothing planned on our end there's nothing that I see at this stage on the states agenda
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:45.140]   that would say that but when you say the word ever you know that's a long time so it seems
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:51.100]   like the offshore wind program really is kind of supplanted that at least the time being
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:59.040]   yeah I think that's a good way of looking at it okay great thank you very much okay thanks
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:06.220]   Mike our next question is from insu Kim from Goldman Sachs good morning insu good morning
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:11.340]   guys my only question is and apologies if I miss this but could you give just an update
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:17.620]   on the Connecticut grid mock filings and any updates on expected decisions from the Commission
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:24.040]   and you know timing of investments etc thanks for your question insu and I hope you and
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:31.540]   your family are doing well you didn't miss it I mentioned you know in terms of what items
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:38.020]   could be additive to our five to seven percent core business growth rate I alluded to grid
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:49.940]   mod in Connecticut or New Hampshire or potentially additional AMI dockets in Massachusetts but
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:56.180]   there's really been no change there we all the parties filed comments and plans back
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:01.100]   in in July and certainly you can understand there's been a lot there's been a lot going
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:08.380]   on and I think I may have said East IEIS was in October but we all know that East IEIS
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:14.500]   was in August so since August there's been a lot of you know there's been a lot of focus
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:19.820]   on on storms there's been a lot of dockets and as somebody else mentioned we have dockets
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:27.300]   going on in terms of moratoriums and whatnot so this you know the expectation was there
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:33.940]   was going to be another sort of go round in another process in Connecticut towards the
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:40.820]   end of the year I really haven't seen anything that would indicate specific schedule you
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:46.860]   know on that so I guess our best guess is still you know it's still in the pipeline
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:53.220]   and you may see more activity on grid mod there in Connecticut as we move over the next
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:54:00.620]   several months but in terms of being in our forecast you know I want to be clear that
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:08.460]   there is currently no you know zero there's no grid mod spending in our capital forecast
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:14.740]   for any grid mod programs that haven't been approved like in Connecticut or New Hampshire
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:22.540]   so you know once they are approved and once we see what our role would be in them and
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:27.360]   once we see what that you know looks like then we have more confidence in putting in
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:33.820]   the plan so that could be something we have information on by the time we get to the February
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:40.540]   update so you know we'll have to stay tuned on that.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:44.380]   That makes sense that's all I had thank you guys and stay safe.
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.380]   Thank you.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.380]   All right you do.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:47.380]   Thank you too.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:52.700]   David Arkaro from Morgan Stanley morning David.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:53.700]   Good morning.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.700]   Hi Jeff.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.700]   Hi Phil.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.700]   Thanks so much for taking my questions.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.700]   Thank you.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:03.260]   And a quick follow up on offshore wind you know in light of some of the recent delays
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:07.940]   I was wondering if that changes how you're strategizing around other bids that you're
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:15.160]   putting into future RFPs like baking in more contingency anything that might give a greater
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:19.900]   level of comfort around the economics of future projects that you might win.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:26.380]   Thank you David for your comment and I hope you and me are doing well.
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:33.260]   Certainly every piece of information that you get you know and this isn't just offshore
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:38.720]   wind you know this is you know on all our business but I'll focus on offshore wind since
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:44.540]   that's the question you know every month it goes by every quarter it goes by we gain
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:54.500]   more insight and information about construction, about you know rates about you know lots of
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:00.820]   factors if all of those things all of those things are factored into subsequent bids so
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:06.380]   the information that we have available to us you know as we're moving into a bid recent
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:11.540]   bid in New York is different than we had from bids that we made you know in Rhode Island
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:17.820]   or Connecticut or Massachusetts so every data point is important to us and we factor that
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:25.380]   into the next bid so I'd say that absolutely that schedules and how you make it through
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:34.020]   the citing process and all of that informs you know subsequent bids and so I can assure
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:42.420]   you that all those things get you know up to the minute attention before bid goes in.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:48.260]   Okay got it that's helpful and I just wanted to touch on just ONM costs and the ONM budget
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:54.700]   could you remind us how you see that trajectory just for the overall business going forward
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:00.580]   you've been you've got a great track record of controlling ONM so what are the key levers
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:07.020]   in your tool belt Phil that you would focus on going forward for managing ONM?
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:17.420]   You know we've got people processing technology right so all those things are levers to help
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:23.660]   you know our capital program as well as our operating program so you know we continue
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:33.860]   to implement systems and technology that improves processes that makes it more efficient and
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:43.620]   effective work force so we have you know still a robust I'd say series of technology improvements
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:50.540]   if you if you I'll start off by just setting the stage in the guidance we gave we said
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:56.420]   that we expected ONM costs to be you know down this year and then just for the forecast
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:05.420]   period kind of flat going forward so how are we able to do that it is by some of these
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:11.860]   technology changes and we've been implementing more productivity management tools and tools
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:17.780]   for our you know individual line workers and gas bidders and in the field to get their
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:24.300]   work to update their work that we can then take that and automatically update drawings
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:30.160]   and files we don't need you know to hand it off to somebody and so this still these
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:36.040]   productivity technology changes that are happening some went in last year some going
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:43.500]   in this year and more planned for next so that that will be I say the lever under the
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:50.780]   pending for us to have the ability to continue to improve processes and take a needed cost
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:57.620]   out of it okay great that's helpful thanks so much for the caller you're welcome thank
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:05.340]   you David next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar morning Travis good morning
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:13.140]   thank you quick clarification on the storm cost but 275 million number if I heard you
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:19.860]   correctly how much did you expense in the quarter and how much was either deferred
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:25.380]   or capitalized or you will be pending that the regulatory filing that you mentioned
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:36.420]   so that amount that you repeated was a deferred that's how much of a storm cost that we deferred
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:46.580]   in for tropical storm east ideas and that was across all states but primarily in Connecticut
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:52.540]   so that's our deferral that would be you know once the storm gets to a certain level it
[00:59:52.540 --> 01:00:01.780]   triggers a deferral so we that all is deferred storm cost right now in terms of there are
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:07.860]   other storms certainly we had they had an active quarter for storms in general but there
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:14.380]   are other storms other than east ideas that did impact the quarter I mean our storm costs
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:19.740]   were up you know about 10 million dollars for the quarter that went through you know
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:28.440]   our own app so you know for the quarter it's at that level and then the 274 or 5 you mentioned
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:35.920]   deferred across the system okay great that's that's very helpful thank you and then quick
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.140]   follow-up to the discussion on the Connecticut legislation and there's some language in there
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:47.300]   as I understood it's about the general assembly having some review power there what you're
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:53.980]   thought in terms of the scope of what the general assembly separate from pura could do in terms
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:01:00.360]   of either taking back some earnings or rate changes stuff like that separate from what's
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:09.100]   going on in the pura well certainly the general assembly can enact legislation that it feels
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:18.100]   is appropriate in any matter so you know I do think specifically to the the energy legislation
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:28.080]   that was enacted recently in Connecticut that most you know things all were you know for
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:34.620]   the most part moved to pura you know so the regulator so the I guess I look at it as the
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:40.980]   legislation would provide the intent the framework the direction and then pura is the one who
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.760]   is going to be implementing you know they're going to be the ones who evaluate the performance
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:53.020]   based rates they'll be the ones who initiate the storm you know standards and things like
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:59.680]   that and and and look at you know should there be penalties or should there be food you know
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.680]   penalties and things like that so I think that effectively you know the general assembly
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:14.640]   can certainly enact any and all legislation it feels it should and the way that this legislation
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:23.120]   seems to have turned out was that the implementation of that legislation is in the hands of pura
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:28.160]   okay so the potential for any or the risk for any kind of clawbacks would likely go through
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:34.200]   pura instead of go through the general assembly based on that kind of legislation that you
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:42.920]   talked about right yeah as I say you know the pura the dockets are active in will be
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:49.280]   active over you know there's a certain time date that the legislation has given pura
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:57.320]   so we expect that pure will have have the pen on this but again as I say you know legislation
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:07.040]   can always be enacted in any in any area yep yep okay great appreciate all right thank
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.960]   you Travis our next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia good morning Andrew
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:22.920]   hey good morning thanks for squeezing me in first question is with the two rate cases
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.880]   now completed can you remind us which subsidiaries might be next to file general rate cases you
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:32.760]   have plenty of regulatory items of course with grid mod and other initiatives but for general
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:43.320]   rate cases well according to the requirements in Connecticut Connecticut could be an area
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:51.560]   that is required to file by the existing framework that's there and that would be something
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:58.800]   that would be sort of a you know next year sort of event but other than that we're pretty
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:08.520]   much out of the regulatory arena okay great then on offshore winds can you just thinking
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.960]   sorry can you share your latest thinking on how big you're willing to let that business
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.400]   get you talked a lot about the opportunities that you're pursuing beyond the three existing
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:24.120]   projects any thinking as far as from an earnings mix perspective if there's a limitation or
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:29.720]   would you will you plan to just bid bid bid and get as many projects as your leases will
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:37.360]   support well I want to be clear on this because I think it's a very important point that bid
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:44.120]   bid bid isn't our strategy our strategy is to have a financial discipline about growing
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:50.720]   that business in a way that provides appropriate levels of returns that benefit our shareholders
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:57.940]   so just by winning a bid you know doesn't do it it has to be we have to and we continue
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:03.600]   to maintain financial discipline in terms of the amounts that we bid and the returns
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:12.480]   that we're looking for so as long as the returns are at an appropriate level but for that business
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:21.400]   it makes sense to make the bid win the bid and expand the business there the what we've
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:28.280]   said is we are trapped so what we own off the coast of what we have access to in terms
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:34.560]   of lease area you know we could do above 4000 at least 4000 megawatts of offshore wind
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:42.440]   so there's kind of a you know that's the maximum capability that we have so it's not an infinite
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:50.760]   growth type of thing and we had indicated that when these were available that are not
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:56.520]   in our region that we were not interested in them so this is in our region like the ones
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:01.720]   who are involved in are good but other lease areas you know that's not for us in other
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:08.880]   parts of the of the mid Atlantic etc so it's a we're constrained by the lease area and where
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   we're guided by the financial discipline to on our bids and our returns
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:22.200]   got it that's really helpful I guess I should have said bid bid bid responsibly okay
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:31.320]   I hope you say what I'm just saying alright Andrew thank you very much that sort of wraps
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:38.160]   up today if you have any follow-up questions please give us a call or send us an email
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:44.000]   and we look forward to speaking and seeing many of you during the virtual EEI conference

[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.780]   As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.780]   Thank you.
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.500]   I would like to turn the conference over to your house.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.620]   Mr. Brendan Frey, please go ahead.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.620]   Thank you, Grace.
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.040]   Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review SAG's 3rd Quarter 2020 financial
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.040]   results.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.700]   On the call today, we have Krista Herm, Chief Executive Officer and Taylor Smith, Chief
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.700]   Financial Officer.
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.980]   Following Chris and Taylor's prepared comments, we will open the call for a question and answer
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.980]   session.
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.760]   Our 3rd Quarter Earnings Press Release was issued today after the market closed at approximately
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.380]   4.05 pm Eastern Time.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.740]   As a follow-on to the earnings release, we published a supplemental financial information

[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.660]   We also furnished this document to the SEC Enformer.
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.340]   You can find all our earnings documents on our Investor Relations website at SAG.com in
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.700]   the quarterly results section under the Financials tab.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.340]   We are recording this call and a broadcast of the conference call will be archived at
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.120]   the SAG Investor Relations webpage under the Events tab for one year.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.340]   Before we begin, we would like to remind everyone that the prepared remarks contain forward-looking
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.860]   statements and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.860]   your questions.
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.100]   These statements include but are not limited to our outlook for the company and statements
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.920]   that estimate or project future results of operations for the performance of the company.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.100]   These statements do not guarantee future performance and speak as of the date hereof.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.700]   For more detailed discussion on the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.020]   from those projected any forward-looking statements, we refer all of you to the risk factors contained
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.420]   in SAG's annual report on Form 10(k) and quarterly reports on Form 10(q) by the Securities and
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.380]   Exchange Commission.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.620]   SAG assumes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements that may be made in today's release
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.620]   or call.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.660]   Please note that on today's call, in addition to discussing the GAAP financial results,
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.260]   we will discuss adjusted EBITDA on non-GAAP financial measure.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.060]   Explanation of SAG's use of this non-GAAP financial measure in this call, and reconciliation
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.860]   between GAAP and non-GAAP measures required by SEC Regulation G, is included in SAG's
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.980]   press release today, which again can be found on the Investor Relations website.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420]   The non-GAAP information is not a substitute for any performance measure derived in accordance
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.420]   with GAAP.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.580]   And the use of such non-GAAP measures has limitations, which are detailed in the company's press release.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.180]   And now I'd like you to turn the call over to Chris Taverna.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.180]   Chris.
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.380]   Thanks, Brendan, and thank you to everyone on today's call.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.860]   We hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.780]   Firstly, let me start by thanking our entire SAG team across the globe.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.820]   I'm extremely ploughed to see how our teams reacted through the quarter and never last
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.020]   side of serving our consumers and partners with quality products that protect and enhance
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.300]   their devices.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.380]   Over the course of the third quarter, it was pleasing to see our results improve significantly
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.980]   compared with the second quarter and exceed our expectations.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.500]   We are encouraged by our recent performance given the challenges we continue to face from
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.540]   the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.060]   Our work over the past several months, which has included reducing expenses, adapting our
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.340]   operations to the current retail environment, and aggressively managing inventories has put
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.020]   the company in a much stronger financial position and provided a business with good momentum
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.260]   as we head into our busiest selling season.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.020]   Looking at our third quarter in more detail, as we discussed on our Q2 call in August,
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.720]   we saw a significant sequential uptick in sales through in June for both our protection
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.100]   and power categories as several of our larger customers reopened our doors and resumed more
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.700]   normalized store operations, with some sales through weeks even exceeding last year's levels.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.500]   This trend continued into July and consistently improved throughout August and September.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.060]   While our online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced earlier in
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.000]   the pandemic, when much of the brick and mortar was closed, it was still up nicely from a
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.980]   year ago and expanding this channel continues to be a priority for us.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.500]   With respect to our overall performance, Q3 revenue came in at $150 million compared
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.660]   to $147 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 21%.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.780]   This represents a nice improvement from the 28% year-over-year decrease in revenue we
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.980]   reported in the second quarter.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.940]   Despite the roughly $32 million drop in revenue compared with the third quarter last year
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.000]   combined with some gross margin headwinds from higher freight expenses, we delivered
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.040]   adjusted EBITDA up $15 million.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.460]   Thanks to cost saving measures we enacted early in the pandemic.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.540]   Taylor will go through in greater detail on the balance sheet but I wanted to share a
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.660]   few highlights.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.420]   Despite significant market pressure from COVID-19, our account receivable, DSO has improved
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.420]   compared to last year, inventory decline compared to where we ended Q2, we generated positive
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.940]   operating cash flow and we continue to reduce our quarter in net debt balance on a year-over-year
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.500]   and sequential basis.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.460]   By taking quick decisive action back in April and more recently working closely with our
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.140]   retail partners under store reopening efforts, we have been able to successfully navigate
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.100]   through incredibly challenging market conditions, ensuring the financial viability of the company
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.660]   and position ourselves exit this difficult period as a stronger, more nimble organization.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.980]   I now provide some additional color to our categories, starting with protection.
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.820]   We continue to build on our overall digital wellness strategy.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.940]   For a few years now our HERO screen protector has been vision guard, a product that reduces
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.140]   exposure to high-energy visible blue lights that can have damaging effects without changing
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.980]   the screen colors or the peak resolution.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.900]   We have now sold over 10 million units with this technology.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.540]   In addition, all invisible sheen screen protectors produced this year and beyond now also include
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.380]   antimicrobial technology.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.100]   This includes our entire lineup for the new iPhone 12, which is now available in stores.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.600]   Earlier this year we introduced our newest product geared towards our digital wellness
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.580]   strategy, a UV phone sanitizer, which works with all mobile devices and kills up to 99.9
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.020]   percent of staff in E. coli surface bacteria.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.820]   Our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retailers and our
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.460]   consumers and has led to increasing self-serve and greater shelf space with many of our accounts.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.340]   We've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to protect cases with good success,
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.520]   starting with the Samsung Galaxy S20 launch earlier this year and right through to the
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.540]   recent iPhone 12 launch.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.740]   All Gear 4 protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.760]   The combination of disenhancement benefit and Gear 4's differential D3O impact technology
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.980]   is driving excitement amongst consumers, especially as awareness of the brand and product scroll
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.580]   from our efforts to expand distribution.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.580]   With the new iPhone 12, Gear 4 is now available and growing across all of our carrier partners.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.600]   This expanded distribution accelerates the momentum of Gear 4 brand and I'm excited to
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.040]   see it continue to grow through 2021.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.220]   In our power category, Morphe launched many exciting new products during Q3, including
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.820]   the introduction of a new line of wireless charging solutions.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.300]   These innovations are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.820]   devices in one central location.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.420]   In addition, last month we launched the new Morphe Juice Pack Connect.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.640]   This new product represents an evolution of our popular Juice Pack, allowing users to
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.060]   easily charge their phone on demand using a detachable battery feature that is not device
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.540]   specific and is used with or without the consumer's normal phone case.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.500]   Our Halo brand continues to perform well on QVC, which has been a productive partnership
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.380]   and channel, particularly given the number of consumers spending more time at home.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.340]   Q4 is a busy time for our brand with QVC and HSN with a number of earrings planned
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.820]   during the holiday period.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.540]   Looking ahead with the majority of our U.S. partner doors now open and weekly sales will
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.900]   continue to improve, combined with solid direct-to-consumer trends, we feel optimistic about our prospects
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.980]   for remainder of the year.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.260]   While there is still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact shopping behavior
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.420]   this holiday season, including the effect on several countries in Europe that have recently
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.980]   implemented lockdowns, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on demand regardless
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.140]   of which channel our consumers choose to engage with the brands.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.540]   We are currently planning 4/4 revenue to increase from third-quarter levels and continue improving
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.060]   on the year-over-year declines we have experienced the past two quarters, even as we are facing
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.380]   tough comparisons to last year's record Q4 sales.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.340]   I am confident in the long-term course we have set for the company.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:44.060]   Our efforts around antimicrobial UV sanitization and blue light protection are driven by our
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:49.140]   belief that consumers will increasingly look for solutions that will hinder digital wellness.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.540]   We also believe another consumer priority will be increased productivity and comfort
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.540]   from home.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:59.300]   We will continue our focus on enhancing technology in our lives to accomplish these growing needs.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.500]   While it remains difficult to know when conditions will fully normalize and what impact COVID-19
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.260]   will have on the global economy and our industry, I am confident that we have taken the right
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.780]   steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.660]   This includes our decision to discontinue certain lower-margin product and categories and simplify
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:21.020]   our core lines of business as a more nimble company that can better serve its retail partners
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.660]   and core consumers, capitalize on detailed wins from the multi-year rollout of 5G with
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.900]   the margin of benefits from our branding category consolidation and generate increased value
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.900]   for our shareholders.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.320]   I will now hand the call over to Taylor.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.820]   Thanks Chris.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.420]   Since many details of our quarterly financial performance were included in the supplemental
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.260]   financial information issued earlier today, I would just like to take a few minutes to
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.780]   add some additional comments on our third quarter financial performance.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:53.300]   Q3 net sales decreased year over year by approximately 21% to $115 million.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.580]   After exiting a very difficult second quarter, we saw good momentum throughout the third
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:03.780]   quarter as retail outlets continued to reopen and allow a more normal in-store shopping experience.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.660]   That being said, the residual effects of COVID-19 combined with the delay of the launch of the
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:13.460]   new Apple devices, which pushed some orders into Q4, made it a difficult year-over-year
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.460]   compare.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.180]   Overall, we're pleased with the momentum and sell-through improvements we saw at retail,
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.940]   which enabled us to increase sales by almost 50% on a consecutive quarter basis from $77
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.260]   million to $115 million.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.340]   Q3 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased year over year to 33%.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.100]   There were a number of puts and takes that impacted gross profit during the quarter, including
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.140]   a benefit from net lower duty rates and expected duty refunds, which I'll discuss in more detail
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.340]   in a second.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:47.380]   This benefit was offset by higher expedited air freight and increased air freight rates,
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.180]   along with the sale of excess inventory at margins that were lower than our historical
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.500]   averages.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.020]   On the subject of duty refunds, in early August, we received an exclusion notice that duties
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:02.660]   paid on certain products imported from China starting in late 2018 may be subject to refund.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.420]   We worked closely with our customs broker to begin submitting refund documentation to
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.660]   U.S. customs.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.460]   This work is ongoing and given the volume of imports from China since late 2018, we'll
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.560]   continue throughout the fourth quarter.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.180]   Based on the work completed to date, we recorded a refund receivable at quarter end of approximately
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.620]   $5.4 million for duties paid that we expect to be refunded.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.580]   The income statement impacted this receivable offset by the balance sheet reduction from
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.300]   duties previously capitalized in inventory and then sold in Q3 2020 was a net income statement
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:39.420]   benefit of $1.7 million or approximately 140 basis points to gross profit margin during
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.580]   the quarter.
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.980]   As I mentioned, there is still quite a bit of work left to do during the fourth quarter
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.020]   to complete our remaining refund submissions and we'll provide an update on any additional
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.340]   refund upside on our next call.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:57.300]   Q3 operating expenses decreased 29% or approximately $12 million compared to last year.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.380]   The decrease was due primarily to the various cost-cutting measures we implemented as a
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.700]   result of the expected COVID-19 impacts on demand.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.020]   Over the last several months, we've made the conscious decision to bring some individuals
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.820]   back from furlough to support fourth quarter product launches and customer care, but we
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.940]   continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.940]   time.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.040]   Q3 adjusted EBITDABUS $15 million vs. $21 million in the prior year period.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.260]   The decline vs. last year is linked to decrease sales and reduction in overall gross profit
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.220]   margin for the reasons I mentioned.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.020]   These items were offset by the decreases in operating expenses that I just discussed.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.900]   Turning to the balance sheet, compared to a year ago accounts receivable decreased 33%
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.540]   to $91 million due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.980]   However, our DSOs improved significantly from 87 days to 73 days.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.180]   The quality of our receivables remains very good.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.300]   There was $80 million compared to $94 million at the end of the first quarter, a reduction
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.020]   of approximately $14 million.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.000]   During the third quarter, we took a conservative approach to inventory as we closely monitored
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.300]   retail sell-through, customer forecasts and customer inventory levels to ensure we didn't
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.900]   overextend on inventory purchasing.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.300]   As a result, we did incur some incremental expedited air freight charges due to increased
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.660]   demand at the end of the third quarter as retail sell-through improved.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.280]   At this point, we will continue to closely monitor the factors that influence our purchasing
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.380]   forecasts, but we will continue to plan conservatively due to the continued uncertainties related
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.140]   to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.940]   Despite the continued headwinds from COVID-19 during the quarter, we generated a third quarter
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.620]   operating cash flow of approximately $9 million compared to negative $11 million in cash from
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.440]   operations during the prior year period.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.300]   Net debt, which has consolidated debt less cash, decreased to $81 million compared to
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:52.840]   $97 million in Q3 last year and $85 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.020]   As we discussed on the last call, during April, we amended our credit facility to increase
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:03.020]   the total amount available into the line of credit from $125 million to $145 million.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.700]   This expansion combined with the loan received under the CARES Act, the Q2 restructuring
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.820]   and cost-cutting initiatives we've undertaken gives us confidence that we'll successfully
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.220]   navigate the headwinds that COVID-19 has put on the business.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.140]   With capital allocation focused throughout the remainder of 2020, we remain on funding
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.980]   working capital needs and continuing to service our line of credit.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.660]   As we look to the fourth quarter of 2020, we definitely have better visibility now than
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.660]   we did when we last spoke in August.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:34.580]   However, COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty around worldwide retail demand.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.380]   Given this market uncertainty, we will not be providing annual guidance at this time.
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:43.220]   However, given our current view of customer orders and positive retail sell-through trends,
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.740]   we expect strong sequential net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth over the third quarter.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.980]   We expect 2020 year-to-date gross margins to improve during the fourth quarter, though
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.380]   as I mentioned, we'll see some pressure over the next few quarters compared to historical
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.820]   averages of mid-30s as we sell through our excess inventory.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.700]   We expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high 20s to low 30 million
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.580]   dollars for the fourth quarter.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.780]   No different than from many other companies, COVID-19 has been extremely disruptive to
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.780]   our business.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.700]   However, with the steps we've taken to restructure the business, reduce fixed costs and ensure
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.140]   adequate liquidity, I'm confident the likes of this period impacted by COVID-19 is a much
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.700]   stronger company than when we entered.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.860]   With that, we will now open up the call for questions.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.780]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.620]   If you have a question at this time, please press start in the number one key on your
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.620]   touchtone telephone.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.700]   Again, that is starting the number one key on your touchtone telephone.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.460]   Your first question comes from Delinas Elliot Alper from DA Davidson.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.980]   Your line is open.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:44.980]   Great.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:45.980]   Thank you.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:51.220]   So thanks for the info on just the sequential sales in the fourth quarter, I guess.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:56.980]   Could you talk about any trends quarter-to-date specifically and specifically geographic sales
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.980]   mix?
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.100]   Are you seeing any material changes with sales and geographies that have lost restrictions
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.460]   compared to those that have more?
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:10.700]   Yeah, just a couple of notes, you know, with Apple launch happening a little bit later
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:16.460]   than we had experienced previously, there was maybe $5 million of sales that shifted
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:24.020]   from Q3 into Q4, which obviously benefit kind of the sequential look at revenue.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:29.780]   Overall, though, we're seeing really good sell-through of the phones that seem to be
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.580]   doing very successful in market and obviously we're benefiting from that.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.260]   So Q4 starting off really, really well.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:44.980]   In terms of Geos, no material change in Geo expansion, Chris mentioned or Geo mix, Chris
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.820]   mentioned on his prepared remarks that we are definitely seeing some headwinds, at least
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.660]   in terms of shutdowns in some of our international locations.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:58.980]   However, the wireless dealers in those locations have been deemed as essential and so those
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.980]   have remained open.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:05.940]   And so kind of remains to be seen as to how that's going to impact demand, but I think
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.540]   overall we're definitely seeing some strong signs that we're kind of getting back to
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:17.180]   a more normal Q4 experience though obviously COVID remains, you know, a bit of a cloud
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.100]   over everything.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.900]   Okay, great.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.980]   And then aside from the Apple launch shifting into the fourth quarter, can you talk about
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.820]   the holiday season and kind of what may be different this year versus historically and
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.580]   kind of any implications that may have on the December quarter?
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.820]   Yeah, the one thing that we are starting to see is obviously the Black Friday seems to
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.940]   be more some retailers are taking strategy which are spreading us out over a number of
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.660]   days, over the month, so that's something that's going to be different.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:52.660]   I think we're still going to see a pretty strong online attachment from both side.com
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:59.780]   and obviously through Amazon, but we're very I would say optimistic about the sales show,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.820]   the early sales show on our screen protection and cases are quite strong and that's given
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.740]   that we still have a number of other devices to take the market actually this week.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:16.220]   So overall I think we have some good runway for the holiday season out here.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.500]   Okay, great.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.500]   Thank you.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   Thank you.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.780]   Thanks, Elliot.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.540]   And once again, in order to ask the question, please press start then the number one on
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.100]   your touch down telephone.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.820]   Your next question comes from the line of Matt Dain from Titan Capital Management.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.900]   Your line is open.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.900]   Great.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   Thank you.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.660]   I was hoping you could put a number on the expediting shipping cost that you incurred
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:46.940]   in the third quarter just to give us some better idea how significant those were.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:52.460]   Yeah, it was between two and three million dollars and as I mentioned in my prepared
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.740]   remarks, we really, it was a bit of a balancing act with inventory where we're trying to run
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:03.260]   it down and self through picked up at the end, we did have to move quickly and unfortunately
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.060]   resulted in some expedited air freight charges.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:14.060]   And for the fourth quarter, are you expecting that to reoccur or is it heavy cut up and
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.020]   do you feel like you're in a better place now?
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.340]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.860]   I think we're still probably chasing a little bit of demand.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.780]   The one thing that's also impacted us no different than every other company that's importing
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:34.340]   from overseas is just generally freight rates have increased globally and so that's also
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.340]   impacted it.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.460]   But I think there's probably going to be a little bit of that, as I mentioned, it's
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:44.980]   a bit of a balancing act, we definitely wanted to be careful given the pandemic and how much
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.620]   inventory we were planning and fortunately or unfortunately we've seen some upsides which
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.060]   is great, but we've had to chase those and so I think we're probably still chasing a
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:59.780]   little bit which will impact some of our Q4 sales and then also obviously the spend on
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.780]   freight.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.780]   Great.
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:06.780]   I also wanted to ask if I could really quickly about the tariff situation and now with
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:14.420]   the Biden presidency, I know you've been moving some production out of China, does that change
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:22.740]   your view on moving production out of China or how are you thinking about this new regime?
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.580]   Yeah I think that it doesn't change our strategy.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:31.020]   Ultimately we're looking to diversify across our CM base and make sure that we're setting
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.900]   the company up for continued business.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.700]   So we're still following the strategy and we've had a very good quarter where we've
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:44.380]   now successfully piloted both screen protection and wireless power outside of China.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:50.020]   So it gives us that ability to be able to shift our supply chain when needed.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.620]   Obviously China is still a big part of our strategy but what I like is we're not just
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.500]   looking at it from a tariff perspective now, we're really looking at it from a business
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.380]   continuity perspective.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.380]   Great.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.380]   Thank you both.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.380]   Thanks Matt.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.380]   Thanks Matt.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.380]   Thank you.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.820]   Once again, in order to pass the question, please press start in the number one on your
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.300]   touchstone telephone.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:25.460]   Gentlemen, I'm showing you for the question at this time.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:30.940]   I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Chris and Harry for any closing remarks.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.940]   Thank you.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.780]   Thank you everybody for joining our Q3 earnings report.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.060]   We look forward to updating you again on Q4.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.260]   Have a great evening everyone and stay safe.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.940]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.940]   Thank you all for joining.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.540]   We're now all disconnect.
