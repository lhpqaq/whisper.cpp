[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Monroe Inc.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.920]   Earnings Conference Call for the third quarter fiscal 2020.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.600]   At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.960]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960]   time.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.600]   If anyone should require assistance during the call, please press star zero on your touch
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600]   tone phone.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.480]   As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded and may not be reproduced in
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.720]   whole or in part without permission from the company.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.480]   I would now like to introduce Ms. Maureen Mahauland, Senior Vice President, General
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.560]   Council, and Secretary Monroe.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.560]   Thank you.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   Please go ahead.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.560]   Thank you.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.280]   Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning's call.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.240]   Before we get started, please note that as part of the call this morning, we will be referencing
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:01:02.120]   a presentation that is available on the Investors section of our website at corporate.monroe.com/investors/investor-resources.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.320]   If I could draw your attention to the Safe Harbor Statement on slide two of the presentation,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.640]   I'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.320]   statements about Monroe's future performance.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.240]   Federal results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.000]   The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monroe's filings
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.920]   with the SEC and in our earnings release.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.440]   The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.520]   whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   law.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.800]   Additionally, on today's call, management statements include a discussion of certain non-GAP financial
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.880]   measures which are intended to supplement and not be substituted for comparable GAP measures.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.200]   Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable GAP measures will be included
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.600]   as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.320]   With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.600]   Brett Thornton.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.960]   Thank you, Maureen, and good morning, everyone.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.400]   I'll get started today with a brief overview of our third quarter results, followed by an
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.480]   update on the progress we've made on our Monroe forward strategy.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.800]   As illustrated on slide three, we reported comps down 0.9 percent in the third quarter
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.360]   as higher year-over-year ticket was offset by negative traffic.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.960]   In October and the beginning of November, we performed well against difficult comparisons
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.840]   in the prior year.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.400]   Mild weather conditions towards the end of November and in December caused a slowdown
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.760]   across our core northern markets.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.720]   These conditions have continued into January, with our comparable store sales down 4 percent
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.640]   during the month.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.080]   We do not like talking about the weather, however, it is impossible to ignore the impact it has
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   on our business.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.400]   While we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter, we are executing well
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.320]   against the areas within our control.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.720]   In particular, we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and are confident
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.800]   we are on the right path.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.200]   We are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to deliver
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.040]   strong results, no matter the external circumstances.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.640]   To lead on to our performance by category in the third quarter, we were down 1 percent
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.920]   year-over-year in the entire comparable store sales, as higher ticket year-over-year was
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.080]   offset by a decline in tire volume.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.560]   We experienced more normalized retail pricing this quarter and are focused on further refining
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.960]   our tire strategy to drive strength in our largest category.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.120]   Importantly, we are on track to roll out our tire category management and pricing system
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.120]   beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.600]   approach to real-time pricing.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.000]   I'll provide more details on this shortly.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.480]   Turning to our service and repair categories, we saw a 3 percent decline in brakes year-over-year,
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   falling short of a difficult comparison in the third quarter last year.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.720]   In maintenance, we were flat while front-end shocks were down 1 percent and alignments
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.480]   decline 3 percent year-over-year.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.640]   Overall, our southern markets outperformed our northern markets, as expected, given the
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.840]   mild winter weather conditions we faced in this region.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.560]   New stores added $22.7 million in revenue during the quarter, including $20.7 million from
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.880]   recent acquisitions.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.960]   Regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter, we saw a decline of 20 basis
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.720]   points compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.120]   sales, which resulted in higher fixed costs at the percentage of sales.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.280]   Our variable margin, on the other hand, expanded due to lower year-over-year material costs
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.200]   as a percentage of sales, while slightly higher than the prior year quarter technician labor
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.320]   as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.880]   This is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.000]   We identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.120]   action to drive improved results.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.280]   We will have additional opportunities to continue to improve results in this area as we implement
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.760]   our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.160]   which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust the changes in demand dynamics without
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.800]   sacrifice and sales.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.280]   I now like to turn to the progress we've made in our Monroe Forward Strategy, beginning
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.920]   with our store rebrand and reimage initiative on slide 4.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.720]   This initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing standardized
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.960]   in-store operating procedures, which we call our Monroe Playbook.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.120]   Additionally, we are rebranding select stores to a tire-oriented spanner where targeted
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.720]   demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.080]   service revenues.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.480]   During the first half of fiscal 2020, we finalized the transformations of our first group of stores,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.880]   which includes 44 locations in Rochester, New York, and Mid-Atlantic, as well as the second
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.200]   group, which includes 43 stores in our southern market.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.760]   During the third quarter, we continued to scale this initiative across our base and moved
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.120]   forward with the transformation of 74 stores in four markets and 42 of our recently acquired
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.400]   California stores.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.000]   We have completed the transformation of the 74 stores and have substantially completed our
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.960]   California stores, which are being rebranded under our Tire Choice Auto Service Center
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.040]   spanner to drive higher awareness for tires.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.480]   Turning to slide 5, I'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.200]   rationale as we transform our store base.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.560]   As many of you know, we operate in two store formats.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.800]   Our service brand stores, which generate approximately $600,000 per store in annualized sales, and our
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.080]   tire brand stores, which generate approximately $1.2 million per store in annualized sales.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.400]   Prior to any rebrand activity, we operated 555 service brand stores and 734 tire brand
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   stores.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.240]   As we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores, we are prioritizing
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.040]   the higher volume tire brand.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.920]   Throughout this process, we will be consolidating our regional brands, focusing on shifting
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.600]   our service brands over the tire brands.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.760]   The lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.320]   When we speak to re-imaging stores, this primarily means modernizing the appearance of our stores
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.920]   with no associated brand change.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.040]   As we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re-imaging stores, we are leveraging
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.240]   our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   Looking at the bottom left of the slide, you can see here the progress we have made so far.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.400]   We are very much in the early innings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.080]   completed out of our portfolio.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.440]   We separated these stores out between comp stores and non comp stores, which helps us to evaluate
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.960]   their performance post refresh.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   Of our approximately 900 comp stores that we set out to transform, we've completed 134
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:49.280]   stores, and of our approximately 150 non comp stores, we've substantially completed 69.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.080]   As we move forward with expanding this program across our base, we will continue to prioritize
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.760]   markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and our approach
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.680]   will be measured in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.720]   Through the end of this fiscal year, we are focusing on finalizing the transformation of
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.920]   our recently acquired California stores, while starting the transformation of approximately
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.480]   80 more stores that will be completed in Q1 of FY21.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.400]   Moving on to the performance of the stores we've completed so far, to help provide some
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.840]   additional granularity, we separated out how rebranded stores have performed versus the
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.600]   stores that have just been re-imaged.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.200]   Importantly, this data only includes comp stores that have had a full quarter of performance
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.240]   following the completion of their transformation.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:48.800]   This is how we will speak to this performance of our transformed stores moving forward.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.560]   As you can see, and in line with our expectations, we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.560]   stores.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.720]   This shift optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sales without sacrificing
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.840]   our service revenues.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.720]   The stores that have been re-imaged were slightly down, as these are located in our northern
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.040]   markets, which were impacted by the mild weather conditions I mentioned earlier.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.160]   We believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.520]   to come with a streamlined brand portfolio.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.840]   The 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation, given
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:34.400]   they have not had a full quarter post transformation yet, but we are seeing early signs of strength
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.600]   to these stores and are pleased with the results.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.920]   While we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base, the sustained
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.720]   performance we've seen at the stores that have completed the transformation today underscores
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.160]   the impact of this important initiative.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.840]   Turning to slide six and the remainder of our Monroe Forward initiatives, I'd like to focus
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.200]   my discussion on the initiatives that are top priority, which we believe will be critical
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.720]   to supporting our broader strategy.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:10.760]   In the third quarter, we began modernizing our store IT infrastructure at all of our approximately
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.240]   1300 locations.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.560]   This new infrastructure enables state-of-the-art technology, including our new digital phone
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.000]   and texting system, which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.320]   This system will allow us to better track customer execution, driving a more consistent phone
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.720]   strategy, and improved conversion.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.440]   Our store infrastructure modernization will be completed by the end of the first quarter
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.800]   of fiscal 2021, allowing us to leverage our new phone system, which will be critical to
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.000]   driving traffic to our stores.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.360]   Another priority for us is the optimization of our entire category of management.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.600]   We are on track, and by the end of this fiscal year, we expect our new pricing software will
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.240]   be operational.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   We believe this will be critical to driving long-term margin expansion by providing improved visibility
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.560]   into demand dynamics, allowing us to better refine our assortments, and execute our strategy
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.920]   to become the number one destination for tires at any price point.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.240]   Finally, we are right on track to roll out our cloud-based or scheduling model pilot
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   by year-end.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.600]   Gaining real-time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.320]   and strategic, ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales or overstaffed when there
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.360]   is a lack of demand.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.360]   Regarding our other teammate initiatives, we have rolled out the Monroe University program
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.720]   to all of our teammates, and are continuing to expand and enhance the course content.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.600]   We've also implemented mandatory onboard training to ensure that everyone who joins our team
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:52.920]   is trained on our Monroe playbook operating procedures in order to provide a quality five-star experience
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.000]   to our customers.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.960]   Moving on to slide seven, while we are very focused on the rollout of Monroe Forward, acquisitions
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.200]   remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.760]   During the quarter, we closed the previously announced acquisitions of three companies,
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.080]   one with 14 locations in Las Vegas, Nevada, and four in Boise, Idaho, as well as two companies
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.280]   that include nine stores in Northern California, further solidifying our growing position in
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.480]   the Western United States.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.960]   Our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts, as well as benefit
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:31.040]   from the high concentration of vehicles in this market, and a potential long-term consumer
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.080]   shift to ride sharing.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.920]   The acquisition in Nevada and Idaho, which are new states to Monroe, is expected to add
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.960]   approximately 20 million in annualized sales, represented sales mix of 75 percent service
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.120]   and 25 percent tires.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.560]   The acquisitions in California are expected to add approximately 25 million in annualized
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.400]   sales, represented sales mix of 55 percent service and 45 percent tires.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:02.680]   These acquisitions are expected to be diluted to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:09.120]   Overall, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.560]   120 million in annualized sales.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:19.080]   We operate in a very fragmented industry, with significant opportunities for further consolidation,
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:25.160]   and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.760]   M&A targets.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.320]   We currently have over 10 NDA signed with opportunities ranging from five to 40 stores,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.740]   which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:42.720]   while continuing to expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.080]   Further, by continuing to execute our Monroe Forward initiatives, including our new brand
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.720]   standards and operating procedures, we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.200]   and efficiently.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:00.560]   Lastly, we open one greenfield location during third quarter, bringing our total greenfield
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.320]   store openings to seven in fiscal 2020.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.600]   In conclusion, we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in our
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.680]   business.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.720]   We are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.480]   a platform capable of delivering sustainable, long-term growth.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.880]   We are not there yet, nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.880]   transformation.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.040]   But we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business, making the
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.880]   appropriate course corrections when necessary, and executing well against the areas within
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880]   our control.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.920]   I'd like to thank the entire team at Monroe for their exceptional work as we execute
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.760]   this strategy, as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.880]   With that, I'll turn the call over to our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.000]   and Treasurer, Brian Deembrosia, who will provide additional detail on our third quarter financial
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.440]   performance and fiscal 2020 outlook.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.800]   Thank you, Brett, and good morning, everyone.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:07.040]   Turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter, sales increased 6.2 percent
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:15.960]   year over year to $329.3 million, driven by sales from new stores of $22.7 million, including
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:22.880]   $20.7 million from recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.040]   of approximately $0.8 million.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.080]   Home store sales in the quarter were down 0.9 percent year over year.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:37.600]   The third quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days, in line with the previous year period.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:44.480]   Rose margin decreased 20 basis points to 37.8 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2020
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.000]   from 38 percent in the prior year period.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.600]   This decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.640]   of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:04.240]   However, as Brett mentioned, we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.160]   costs as a percentage of sales.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:14.520]   Operating expenses for the quarter increased $5.5 million to $92.8 million, or 28.2 percent
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:22.680]   of sales, is compared with $87.3 million, or 28.1 percent of sales for the prior year period.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.920]   The year over year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net new stores.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:36.280]   Our operating income for the third quarter was $31.6 million, which increased by 2.8 percent
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:42.520]   as compared to operating income of $30.7 million for the same quarter last year, and decreased
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:48.000]   as a percentage of sales from 9.9 percent to 9.6 percent.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.200]   Net interest expense for the third quarter increased $0.2 million to $7 million as compared
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.920]   to $6.8 million in the same period last year.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.160]   The weighted average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.240]   approximately $112 million as compared to the prior year period.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.600]   The increase is primarily related to an increase in financing leased debt recorded in connection
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.200]   with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions and greenfield expansion, as well as an increase in debt
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.440]   outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisition.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.400]   The weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.040]   140 basis points year over year due to lower LIBOR and prime interest rates, as well as
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.960]   lower borrowing rates associated with new leases.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.640]   Our effective tax rate was 24.1 percent for the third quarter compared to 15.3 percent
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   for the same period last year.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:51.960]   The year over year increase is primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit adjustment
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.280]   we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change, which
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.920]   was related to certain deductions that the IRS accepted during the examination of our
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.320]   fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 tax returns.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:13.760]   That income for the third quarter was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the prior
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.300]   year period.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:21.400]   Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 56 cents compared to diluted
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.360]   earnings per share of 61 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.520]   Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is a non-gap measure, for the third quarter
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.880]   of fiscal 2020 was 60 cents, which excludes from diluted earnings per share, 3 cents of
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.840]   costs related to Monroe Forward Initiatives, and 1 cent of costs related to acquisition due
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.040]   diligence and integration.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.760]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 57 cents in the third quarter
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:56.200]   of fiscal 2019, which excluded 1 cent of costs related to Monroe Forward Initiatives, 1 cent
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.680]   of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs, and 6 cents benefits from
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.320]   the one-time income tax adjustment.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.560]   For more information on this non-gap measure, please see the reconciliation of adjusted
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.600]   diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.080]   Lastly, we opened one Greenfield location during the third quarter.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.720]   As a reminder, Greenfield stores include new construction, as well as the acquisition
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.640]   of one-to-four store operations.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:32.000]   Gold locations on average are expected to add approximately $1 million each in annual sales.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.040]   As of December 28, 2019, the company had 1,289 company-operated stores and 99 franchise locations,
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:48.000]   as compared with 1,186 company-operated stores and 99 franchise locations, as of December
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.520]   29, 2018.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:57.200]   During the third quarter, we added 27 company-operated stores and closed none.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.400]   Turning to slide 9, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.960]   as we execute our growth strategy.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.280]   Our capital expenditures were $42.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, of
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:17.440]   which approximately $18 million was related to investments in our Monroe Forward Initiative.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.840]   We are pleased with the progress of our Monroe Forward strategy, and we continue to expect
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.880]   an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years to
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.680]   support investments in story image and technology.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:38.760]   Additionally, accretive acquisitions support our growth strategy.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:45.320]   During the first nine months of the year, we spent approximately $104 million on acquisitions,
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.880]   including one-to-four store acquisitions completed as part of our Greenfield expansion strategy.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.640]   As Brett mentioned, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.560]   an expected $120 million in annualized sales.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.680]   I'd like to provide some additional clarity here.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.960]   The $120 million in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:15.160]   fully integrated, which, as we've stated in the past, is usually in year three post-acquisition.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.480]   During years one and two following the acquisition, we typically see a step down in sales, given
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.240]   the process of onboarding new stores to our model.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.000]   Moving on, we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.400]   program and paid approximately $22 million in dividends in the first nine months of fiscal
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   2020.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.520]   Finally, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.120]   to support our strategic growth initiatives.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.880]   We entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.120]   covenants.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.440]   We generated approximately $125 million of cash flow from operating activities during
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:00.240]   the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and debt under our revolving credit facility increased
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.040]   by approximately $59 million.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:10.480]   Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide 10, we have updated our fiscal 2020
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:16.320]   comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of 1% to flat to reflect the impact
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.640]   of our year to day performance.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   Based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:31.400]   closed acquisition, we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1,275 million
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:40.280]   to $1,290 million, an increase of 6.2% to 7.5% as compared to fiscal 2019 sales.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:49.480]   This compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1,295 million to $1,315 million.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.160]   Our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.720]   2020.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.520]   Given the impact of our year to day performance, we expect fiscal 2020 earnings for diluted
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:11.200]   share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 representing a decline of 5.1% to 0.8% year
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.120]   over year compared to $2.37 in fiscal 2019.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:23.420]   This compares to the previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.55.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.760]   On an adjusted basis, which is a non-gap measure, the company expects diluted earnings for share
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:39.120]   to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 representing a decline of 1.7% to growth of 2.5% which excludes
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.240]   from diluted earnings per share Monroe forward initiative costs and acquisition due diligence
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.200]   and integration costs.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:53.240]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.39 in fiscal 2019 which excluded
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   Monroe forward initiative costs, non-recurring corporate and field management realignment
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.720]   costs, acquisition due diligence and integration costs, and the benefit from the one-time income
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.160]   tax adjustment.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.280]   Acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be diluted to earnings
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.920]   per diluted share during the year.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.720]   At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect an operating margin of approximately
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:24.800]   10.2% interest expense to be approximately $29 million, depreciation and amortization to
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.480]   be approximately $65 million, and EBITDA to be approximately $196 million.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.040]   We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million this year.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:42.160]   This guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and is based on 34 million
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.040]   diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.080]   As always, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or Greenfield store opening.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.800]   I'll now turn the call over to Brott to provide some closing remarks before we move to Q&A.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.880]   Thanks Brian.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.240]   We are making solid strides in the execution of our Monroe forward strategy, in particular
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.400]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.480]   The strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore our
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.440]   confidence in this initiative.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.000]   The store rebrand and reimage program is further supported by our technological investment
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.920]   which we believe will help drive long-term margin expansion.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.680]   In summary, we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.040]   making the appropriate course corrections when necessary, and executing well against the areas
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.520]   within our control.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.400]   We are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   ahead.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.240]   With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   Thank you.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.200]   At this time we will be conducting a question and answer session.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.600]   If you would like to ask a question please press star 1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.520]   A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.400]   You may press star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.600]   For participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.520]   pressing the star keys.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.280]   Once again that is star 1 to register questions at this time.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.360]   Our first question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer, please go ahead.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.080]   Good morning.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:22.320]   I apologize for focusing on the weather here, but I want to dive deeper into sales trends
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   in the quarter.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:33.400]   You made some comments suggesting that to the degree to which weather impacted the business.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.160]   I was wondering if you could drill down a little further and say what that negative .9 comp would
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:44.680]   have been had the weather cooperated, and some of the other metrics you are seeing that really
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.800]   suggest the underlying business is trending better than what we saw in the weather affected
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   physical queue 3.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.080]   I will take the first part and I will let Brian take the second part of the question Brian.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:02.920]   When we look at the performance in the quarter, as we talked about our northern markets certainly
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.240]   underperform the southern markets and give you a little more granularity on that, certainly
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:15.280]   our stores up in the northeast and the midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:20.040]   to weather conditions like you have in the northeast certainly underperform.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.560]   I think it is difficult to say what we would have done.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.040]   Certainly I think we were expecting positive comps in the quarter.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:36.880]   Our internal expectations would have been closer to +1 to +1.5, assuming normalized weather
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.160]   conditions that we have seen in the past.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.440]   We felt really good coming out of October and November given the strength of last year's
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:50.840]   performance that we were topping against and did not get the cooperation from the weather
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.120]   in December that we were certainly expecting.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.600]   As I made the comments in my prepared remarks, we certainly do not like talking about the
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:05.840]   weather Brian, but we cannot ignore the fact that when 50% of our business has tires and
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.120]   we have a high concentration of stores in the northeast and midwest, we are going to have
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.320]   outsized exposure to our comp performance.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:21.520]   Brian, would you mind restating the second part of your question?
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.480]   Well I think you covered, Brian, maybe I will just follow the question if I could.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:32.720]   So the guide, the adjusted guidance that you mentioned, so in January you did a negative
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.720]   four.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.280]   Now if I am doing the math, it looks as though the adjusted guidance would suggest some type
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   of pickup then in business, and in February and March, I guess the first question is that
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.880]   assumption correct.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.200]   And then the following question is, I know we have seen this before with your business,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:55.680]   but at what point does the clue we have potentially a long time in the winter, the weather could
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.800]   still come, but is there a point at which in the quarter where the weather just comes too
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   late?
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:09.960]   Yeah, so Brian, your assumption is correct regarding the implied comp.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:17.040]   So if you think about Q4 at the midpoint of let's say down point five, for the full year
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:23.840]   down point five, that implies Q4 of down two, which would be about February and March being
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.120]   down one in order to get to that down two.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.320]   So that is the dynamic at the midpoint, so there is an expectation of a pickup in February
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   and March.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:39.880]   And Brian, maybe just to comment on the second part, as we get deeper into the fourth quarter,
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.720]   our fourth quarter, the second half of the quarter in particular, I think we become less sensitive
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   to the weather as you transition out of say, pure winter conditions into spring.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.560]   Certainly I think the later in the quarter you get snowfall certainly doesn't have the
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:04.680]   same impact on tire demands like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in October
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.560]   or November.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.480]   Consumers are pretty frifty with their money and I believe you get snowfall late in the
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   season.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.400]   They have a tendency to forego that purchase and push it out till next season in particular.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.680]   The other thing to call out as well is if you look at our historic performance at the company,
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   December and January have always been the most volatile months that we had to contend with.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:36.960]   And I think what we've seen in past performance here, trends coming out of December, January
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.240]   don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring months.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:48.920]   So given the mild December, January heading into the balance of the quarter, we feel pretty
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.880]   good about the guidance range we provided.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.760]   As Brian said, our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our comp sales guidance it assumes
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.040]   run rate coming out of January, which we certainly believe we're going to be better than that
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.360]   as we roll into FY21.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.360]   I appreciate all the color.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.360]   Thank you.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360]   Thank you.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.800]   Our next question is coming from Jonathan Lamers of BMO Capital Markets.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.200]   Please go ahead.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   Thanks.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:26.000]   Brett, looking at your slide on the store rebranding, the 18% performance of the rebranded
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.720]   stores I think is good.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.760]   I'm curious from your analytic model, how many years should it take a rebranded store to
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.720]   reach projected run rate sales?
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:48.600]   If you look at the top quadrant of that slide, Jonathan, we've shared with investors the fact
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.200]   that our service stores do roughly $600,000 in revenue and our tire stores do $1,000,000
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   too.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.240]   In the case where we're rebranding a service store, you're working off a base on average
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:06.720]   of $600,000 and if we've seen a double digit comp improvement off of that base, you can
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:13.520]   get to implied numbers certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp to the full
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.000]   maturity equally in the average sales performance of our tire brand stores.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.440]   That's one of the things that's encouraging about the strategy for us is not that it's
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.520]   just the one-time step up in sales.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:34.240]   This creates the opportunity to create multiple years of sustainable growth as our brand and
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:39.080]   our positioning, our brand related to tires, starts to mature.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:44.320]   Keep in mind that tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.280]   If we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires, we won't be relevant
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.040]   necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.880]   To put that on a timeline, if you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:04.160]   out to average sales performance of the tire brand store.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:09.240]   Just a circle up on that for the stores where you're rebranding.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.200]   There's nothing about their market.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:19.000]   You would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.360]   stores of the $1.2 million, is that correct?
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.560]   Yeah, as a general statement, that's correct.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.920]   I think certainly you're going to have markets that will exceed the average and you'll have
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:35.120]   some markets that will be lower than that, and that's part of the choices that we may
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:41.520]   use in the analytic model, but on average, as we look across our, I'll say the opportunity
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:47.440]   stores that be in the 555, I think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.040]   the full potential of the 1.2 over time as they mature.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:35:02.000]   Thanks, switching gears, Brian, how much of a headwind to that revenue from acquisition
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.440]   were the conversions of the 42 California stores this quarter?
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:13.000]   Yeah, I mean, we had some disruption there.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.920]   I would say we haven't really quantified that from a sales standpoint, but that's a great
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.680]   point, Jonathan, in that.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.160]   We have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the Monroe Playbook, and then
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:34.420]   shortly thereafter, in this case, about six months, get the reimage in-store brand standards
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.920]   in place.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:42.920]   So those, in Q3, the 42 California stores went through that, and they're substantially through
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:50.000]   that as of the end of Q3, but we haven't quantified it, but it certainly had some impact on their
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.560]   sales performance in the quarter.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:00.000]   Okay, and that $1.8 million charge for Monroe Forward Initiative this quarter, what was
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   that for?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.560]   Yeah, it was all related to the store rebrand and reimage, and it falls into three primary
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.840]   buckets related to that.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:19.880]   The first is non-capital items that we send to the stores, so as we think about updated
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:26.400]   safety chains, updated bay banners, updated point-to-sale marketing materials, all of these
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:34.520]   things to get the store initially to the standard that are not capital in terms of the actual
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.840]   work and construction done on the store, that's the first bucket.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   The second bucket is non-capital work that's actually done.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:51.960]   We get into these stores and we identify non-capital repairs, demolition, as well as some of the
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:58.600]   fixed versus replace items, for example, stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   a new floor.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.480]   Those are things that make sense economically, but you get different treatment from expense
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.760]   versus capital for, so that's the second bucket.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:14.240]   The third is just right off of existing leaseholds in the stores, anything from counters to maybe
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.480]   some existing signage that was put off as part of an acquisition when we initially branded
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.040]   the stores over to a Monroe brand.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:27.960]   Those are the three primary buckets that the Monroe Forward Initiative costs consist of.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.880]   Okay, thanks for your comment.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   Thank you.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.000]   Excuse me, our next question is coming from Brett Jordan of Jeffries.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Please go ahead.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Hey, good morning guys.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Morning Brett.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.120]   Hey, back to slide five, I guess if we look at the 18% growth in rebranded stores, if we
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.480]   really sort of look at the comparable growth there, X, the new product lines you're adding,
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.360]   how's the service comp against the service comp in those stores?
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.600]   Are you seeing a pickup as you change the brand?
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:05.040]   Yeah, maybe just to clarify though, Brett, I think we're actually not adding any new
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.880]   products to the service menu.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.120]   Right, but you're adding tires to the store, right?
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:15.320]   Yeah, it's just mixed, right, so even our service stores today sell tires.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:21.760]   It's only 15% of their mix, so we're certainly seeing growth, more outsized growth in their
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:28.200]   tire sales, and we've had success in maintaining the rate of growth that we've seen on the
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:34.840]   service side, which has been part of our thesis is hold on to the service business that we've
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:40.200]   enjoyed, that's high margin, and then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.520]   tires and drive the growth through the tire category.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.840]   We're seeing growth on both sides.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:52.600]   Okay, and I guess we look at the reimage, how does that compare to comparable service
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.080]   stores in the network that hadn't been re-imaged?
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   I guess sort of looking at it again, sort of apples to apples against the old stores.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.600]   Yeah, I think if you can figure out which stores we're talking about there, the 30 stores are
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:12.480]   Rochester, and I think the Rochester stores certainly have been performing quite well relative
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.920]   to what our expectations were on re-image.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.520]   We certainly didn't expect to see double-digit growth rates out of our re-image store when
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:25.040]   we set out to do this initiative, but we were seeing more positive growth out of the store
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.240]   as up until the last quarter, given the exposure that we've had to the weather in the north.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:35.360]   But compared to other stores, we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a customer
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:41.040]   service point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers, facing
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.280]   similar, I would say, market backdrop from a weather point of view.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.280]   Okay.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.840]   Could you give us, I guess, sort of the spread between the Southern Store Cop and the Northern
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.840]   Store Cop?
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.160]   Yeah, I guess Delta was it.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:00.400]   I mean, it was a couple hundred basis points of performance.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   Okay.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.880]   And I guess for housekeeping, could you give us the monthly?
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:10.680]   Yeah, so we were -- one second here, Brett.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:18.560]   We were down 1.2 in October, down 1.7 in November, and up 0.4 in December.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.560]   Okay.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.480]   And then one -- just this is -- sorry, I had the questions.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.640]   On the supply chain side, I mean, just to throw the virus into it, since that's popular
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:32.360]   these days, you guys do a lot of direct sourcing, you know, the White Box product out of China.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.960]   Do you see any impact on supply chain from what's going on?
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.880]   We haven't seen any to this point, Brett.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:46.320]   We're obviously working through contingency plans, which we have had to develop actually
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.680]   related to the tariff issues.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.240]   So we feel pretty confident that through the network of, you know, multiple supply points
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.240]   that we'll be able to overcome any particular issues coming from the virus.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.240]   And so --
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.520]   I had to get my first virus question in there.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.960]   Yeah, I'm sorry, Brett.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   Go ahead.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960]   I said no.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.960]   It's joking.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   I said I had to get my first virus question in there.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.960]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   All right.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   Thanks a lot, guys.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   Keep on.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.960]   Okay.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   Thanks, Brett.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.440]   Thank you.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.040]   Our next question is coming from Rick Nelson of Stevens.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.040]   Please go ahead.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.040]   Thanks.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.040]   Good morning.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   Good morning.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.840]   Follow up on the weather.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:34.640]   Last year, I think, December, January, you also pointed to mild winter weather.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:41.760]   Do you think this year was incrementally worse than the prior year?
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:48.120]   I think if you look at, you know, analyst reports that we've seen talking about, I guess,
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:54.680]   the impact that the mild winter has had on not only our category but other retail, like
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:42:00.720]   the data would indicate that this has been more mild, certainly, versus last year.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.560]   And I think if we look at precipitation, which is very important for us as a form of
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:11.480]   snow with our tire business, certainly, it's been a much, I think, more mild winter of
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.720]   this year relative to last year.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   Thanks.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:23.520]   And Brett, any updates on your partnership with Amazon, what you're seeing there on the
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:35.040]   install side, and how you think your tire prices compared to theirs, and the tire category
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:42.720]   overall, I'm curious about what happened with units in the period and market share?
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   Yes.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.960]   So, let's start with units.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:56.400]   Our units were down to, average selling price was up one for the quarter.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   How that compares.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.760]   We don't have a lot of syndicated data, of course, we can look to and give you definitive
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.760]   on that.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:08.320]   We can lean on, I guess, our channel checks and information from our tire manufacturers
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:14.000]   that have good visibility across multiple brands, and it feels like similar to other companies
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.120]   that have exposure to the North, in particular Northeast, to the degree that we do, we feel
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:27.400]   like we are probably in line with what we picked up through suppliers and others.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.200]   As it relates to Amazon, I think we're still pleased with our relationship with them as
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:37.000]   well as other online tire retailers.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.280]   We will eventually expand the relationship in FY21 to include all stores.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:50.200]   We talked about last quarter, our priority has been what I mentioned on today's call, completing
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.520]   the tire category management pricing tool, as well as the labor scheduling tool that are
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:01.160]   just for our organization, I think, higher priority at this stage than expanding, but we are committed
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.160]   to expanding that relationship going forward.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.840]   Related to tire pricing, as you know, Rick, the tire category is very complicated.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:15.440]   You have over 30,000 SKUs that you need to manage effectively across multiple markets.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.040]   One of the reasons why we've invested in the tire category management tool is to do a
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   couple of things.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:27.720]   One is to give us much better visibility into demand dynamics, defined by elasticity, down
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.400]   to a SKU level.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.880]   By having that visibility, it's going to create a much more granular approach that we're going
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.520]   to use for pricing.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:43.440]   It will allow us to price at the SKU level in our industry, with the intent being strike
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.560]   that right balance between driving the right price to drive unit volume while preserving
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.640]   and expanding our tire margins through a right mix at right price.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.200]   I'm encouraged we're in pilot form of that now.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.640]   We will be operational by Q1 of next year, fully operational.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.720]   The rollout of that is pretty small in scale because we control our pricing centrally, so
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.520]   a small team of people will be trained up on using that system.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.680]   Between now and Q1, we'll be testing in parallel and make certain we're confident with the
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.840]   results that we're seeing from the system.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.840]   That makes sense.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.840]   Thanks for the color.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.840]   Good luck.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.840]   Thanks, Rick.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:26.840]   Thank you.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:33.160]   Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.040]   one on your telephone keypad.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.760]   Our next question is coming from Stephanie Benjamin of Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   Please go ahead.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   Hi.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   Good morning.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   Thank you for the question.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   Morning.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.880]   I wanted to go back.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.600]   I know in the prior quarters, when you started rolling out some of these store refreshes,
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:56.320]   you called out a hit or headwind to comp during that quarter, really just from distraction.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.640]   You know, it makes sense as you're in there kind of reworking and revamping the stores.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   I believe you said it was about a 70 basis point hit last quarter.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.440]   Did you quantify that this quarter or is there a way for you to kind of break that out or
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.280]   just whether overshadow that?
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:18.520]   Yeah, I think we said last quarter, Stephanie, that we walked everyone kind of through the
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:25.680]   seven step process and talked about how we were retooling it to take a lot of that work
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.080]   or almost all that work off of the store team.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.840]   So, we were able to effectively do that in Q3.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.040]   We didn't expect that we were going to have to talk about a headwind and we really don't
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.680]   have to in terms of from disruption related to the store reimage.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:47.000]   I think the California stores on the West Coast maybe saw a little bit more disruption just
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.760]   because we did put a little bit more on them based on their lack of proximity to our core
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:59.280]   resources that are doing the reimage, but for the 74 comp stores, those were largely, I would
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   say, undisrupted.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.280]   Great.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.920]   And then just as a follow-up, when we look at the Tire category in general, what are you
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.560]   staying from this over in an inflationary environment?
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:15.400]   I know it was inflationary earlier this year kind of reviewing how you saw during the quarter
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.000]   and your expectations going forward as well.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.480]   Yes, Stephanie.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:27.280]   When you look at, go back to Q2, one of the things we commented on was just we saw some
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:34.880]   inflationary pricing on the top end of the product category with more premium brands.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:41.120]   And the first part of the second quarter, we didn't see a lot of movement on the low-end
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.360]   brands, if you will, opening price point brands.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.800]   We saw that change exiting Q2 and into Q3, and I think as you saw, we made the comments
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:56.880]   in our prepared remarks, we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across all price
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.880]   points.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:06.080]   Relative to that point in Q3, I think our expectation for Q4 is pretty stable environment around pricing.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.560]   We don't expect meaningful material changes in the next quarter.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:19.400]   I think we're very focused now on now optimizing our internal pricing relative to the market
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:24.680]   leveraging the category management pricing until we talk to them.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.680]   Great.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:30.400]   And then just lastly for me, kind of a more high level, as we think through the strategy
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:37.480]   to expand just your tire services, some of the mix changes that your service stores, does
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:43.300]   that just by nature put you a little bit more susceptible to changes in weather on an annual
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.300]   basis?
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:49.620]   To your point, you said on this call that it is the tire category that if it's a more mild
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:54.360]   weather where you don't really see the volume during that period.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:59.200]   So does this mean that in these conversations going forward, weather could have a larger
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.760]   impact or similar to what we saw this year that may be in prior years?
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.840]   So maybe your thoughts on that at this high level would be great.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.840]   Thanks so much.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.640]   Yeah, thanks, Stephanie.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:14.560]   I think strategically, I would start with this, they are strategy and rose.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:20.440]   We like the business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that's focused on tires
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.600]   and full service.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:26.880]   I think you're not going to see us migrate to a tire only category as a broad sweeping
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.560]   strategy for all the reasons you just mentioned.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.200]   We like diversification in the services.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.440]   We like being very relevant on frequently purchased items.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:42.000]   Like scheduled maintenance for cars and certainly brakes and other undercar services.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.680]   I think as we increase our total business, certainly we're going to pick up a little more
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:54.000]   exposure to tires as we convert more stores in the north, I think, to that.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   However, I think our broader company strategy is diversifier store footprint.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.920]   More into the south and out west, and certainly in those regions of the country, you don't
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.640]   see, I think, a level of volatility that comes with the tire business like you would find
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:15.000]   in the northeast and midwestern markets.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.200]   Great, that's everything for me.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   Appreciate it.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.200]   Okay.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   Thanks, Stephanie.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   Thank you.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.240]   Our next question is coming from Scott Stumber of CL King.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   Please go ahead.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:34.600]   Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.600]   Where's Scott?
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:42.200]   Following up on that last question about high level, about weather, and I know the goal here
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.280]   was with all this heavy lifting that you're doing right now on all these new processes
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:52.320]   to get to the point where, I guess, we're not talking about weather having worked.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.720]   Weather does not really deliver all the quarter from a comprehensive.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.720]   Could you talk about, I mean, just broadly speaking about how long do you think that will
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:05.360]   take for us to get to that point where weather could be a headwind, but it's not going to
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.960]   be a determinant, whether you're positive or negative from a conscious standpoint?
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:17.600]   Yeah, I think, given our exposure to the northeast, as long as our store concentration is heavy
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:23.640]   in the Midwest and northeast, inherent in that, is we pick up exposure, I think, to weather.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.200]   Obviously, we don't like to talk about this guy, as you said.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:32.120]   Our strategy is diversify the footprint, keep continuing to grow down south, and that's reflected
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.120]   by our acquisitions.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:40.520]   We continue to build out Florida and have expanded now into Louisiana and Tennessee, and certainly
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:46.640]   out west is reflected of that desire to create more or less volatility in our business due
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.640]   to this store footprint.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:56.240]   Now in our core store markets, we don't accept internally the volatility in our business
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:03.840]   and we're invested in technology, as we talked about, to help us better execute in stores
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:10.400]   through better trained people, executing better on the phones with our phone upgrade that we're
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.400]   currently doing.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:16.000]   All of the initiatives under Monroe Forward are designed to drive performance in our stores
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.600]   regardless of weather, so I think we'll help neutralize some of the impact that we see from
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.420]   the volatility that comes with snow and colder temperatures.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:31.580]   Got it, and just a last question.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:36.640]   I know that there are certain things like tires that we'll see an immediate impact from weather,
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:45.160]   but more on the side of mechanical parts, typically you could see an impact from warmer weather
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:49.640]   or colder weather, a few quarters down the road.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.240]   Is there a chance that we could see an extended negative impact on the mechanical part side
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   in the next couple of quarters?
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   And that's all I have.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   Thanks.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.240]   Thanks, Scott.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:05.400]   I think as we commented in the quarter, our brakes were down three percent in the quarter.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.160]   Certainly we're up against a strong comp from last year, but also I would say we do sell
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:14.600]   a fair share of brake services through tires, because if you take the consumers' tires
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.920]   off their vehicle, it gives you the chance to inspect their wheels, their brakes.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:25.400]   We do see some nice demand for conversion from tires into brakes as a result of that.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:32.880]   As it relates to the downstream effect, I think certainly more harsh winners have a tendency
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.160]   to tear up things on the vehicles.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:41.480]   However, I will say one benefit of having a more mild winner is usually that it leads
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.200]   to spring coming sooner.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:50.400]   It opens up a window, I think, for an extended spring selling season.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:55.240]   We feel like we're well positioned, I think, coming out of the winter, given our strengths
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:54:00.040]   and how we perform historically in the service categories, and given the emphasis that we
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:06.280]   placed on good, better, best packages in store, I think we feel confident that we'll be well
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.880]   positioned going into the spring selling season.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.880]   Got it.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:11.880]   That's all I have.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.880]   Thanks.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.880]   Thank you.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.880]   Thank you.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:21.320]   At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:25.120]   Thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest and support of Monroe.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.960]   We believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy and drive long-term value for
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.960]   our shareholders.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:32.920]   We look forward updating you on our progress next quarter.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.320]   Have a great day.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:38.960]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.240]   This concludes today's event, you may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:43.400]   day.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620]   Good morning and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 General Electric Company Earnings Conference
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.620]   Call.
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.180]   My name is Brandon and I'll be your operator for today.
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.380]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.140]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session during which you can dial star one
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.780]   if you have a question.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.380]   Please note this conference is being recorded and I will now turn it over to Steve Winiker,
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.780]   Vice President of Investor Communications, you may begin sir.
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.780]   Thanks Brandon.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.540]   Good morning and welcome to GE's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.540]   I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO Larry Kulp and CFO, Carolina DiDicapa.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.860]   Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.860]   on our website.
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.060]   Note that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and are based on our best
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.380]   view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.220]   As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.100]   With that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.940]   Steve, thanks.
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.200]   Good morning everyone.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.620]   We hope you and your families are healthy and safe, our thoughts are with all of those affected
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.660]   by this global pandemic.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.500]   We recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.160]   On behalf of GE, I want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.620]   community, many of whom were privileged to call our customers, working tirelessly to protect
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.380]   all of us.
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.380]   Thank you.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.980]   When we last spoke during our Outlook call in March, we were encouraged by the continued
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.700]   strength and aviation and healthcare and the progress made in power and renewables.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.700]   In the eight weeks since, the world has fundamentally changed.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.500]   As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly, hitting hard and hitting fast.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.580]   While this is an earnings call, our goal today is to provide you with the most current and
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.860]   relevant information we have, and as always, to be as open and transparent as we possibly
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.860]   can.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.780]   So, forgive us if we've run a little long today.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.780]   The COVID-19 dynamics at GE, like the economy at large, are fluid and still evolving, but
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.740]   clearly challenging in the near term.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.380]   With that, I'll start with our response to COVID-19.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.660]   Carolina, who is joining our earnings call for the first time, will cover the financials,
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.460]   then I'll wrap with a more in-depth view of our current operations.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.820]   Moving to slide two, during this unprecedented time, we're focused on three areas.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.340]   First, the health and safety of our employees and our communities.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.740]   We established a COVID-19 task force that is working to ensure we're doing everything
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.100]   in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with the various government directives
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.340]   and medical advisories in real time.
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.620]   To that end, we've encouraged those employees who are not directly performing customer-facing
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.740]   essential jobs to work from home wherever possible.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.420]   But given the mission-critical work we do at GE, not everyone can stay home.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.660]   I'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.300]   unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers, supporting essential services
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.100]   like hospitals, power generation, airlines, and national defense.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.620]   We're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.220]   This includes temperature screenings, face coverings, and gloves as necessary, and physical
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.940]   distancing, all keeping with national, state, and local guidelines.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.740]   I'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.380]   We recently established an employee relief fund, and more than 75 senior leaders across GE have
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.940]   contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.340]   Our second priority is continuing to serve our customers.
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.060]   In healthcare, we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.660]   and treat COVID-19 patients, including respiratory CT monitoring solutions, X-ray anesthesia,
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.100]   and point of care ultrasound product lines.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.980]   Already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.340]   end of June.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.180]   Healthcare's digital and AI solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.940]   at once and automate wrote tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.820]   on life-saving work.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.100]   Across all of our businesses, we're in constant communication with employees, customers, suppliers,
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.580]   and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.620]   Our third priority is preserving our strength.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.580]   First and foremost, sound liquidity is crucial, and solidifying our balance sheet remains a
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.460]   key focus.
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.860]   With the recent closing of the Biopharma transaction, we've received $20 billion of
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.220]   net proceeds.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.900]   This provides GE with optionality to protect our company and remain flexible.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.300]   And importantly, we've retained a $17 billion leading healthcare business at the center of
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.220]   an ecosystem striving for precision health.
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.460]   Preserving our strength in a time like this also requires a different operating model.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.140]   Here I draw on my experience as a CEO managing through 9/11 and the global financial crisis.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.860]   There are three steps in this model.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.020]   Embrace reality, redefine winning, and execute the plan.
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.260]   Easy to say, hard to do.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.140]   Starting with embrace reality, this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.780]   and remains uncertain.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.420]   For us, it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation, and we
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.620]   may be for a while.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.100]   We wish it were otherwise, but that's not our reality.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.100]   Next, redefine winning.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.820]   We came into 2020 with a plan that defined winning as profitable growth, margin expansion,
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.700]   and cash generation.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.340]   Now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.260]   Let me share some ways we're doing this.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:21.340]   While safety has always been a top priority for GE, COVID-19 has reshaped our safety agenda.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.820]   In terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and decriminal margins
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.980]   in the second half, our key focus areas, and in healthcare, we clearly didn't come into
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:37.060]   the year expecting to increase our ventilator production fourfold, but we will.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.140]   And finally, execute the plan.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.900]   We're moving with speed, discipline, and intensity to improve our cost structure targeting more
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.420]   than $2 billion of cost actions and more than $3 billion of cash actions.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.020]   And this is where lean is particularly relevant, from daily management to traditional Kanban
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.300]   systems which help reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools we're rolling out
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.420]   across GE.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.820]   Let me share a recent example from gas power.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.060]   In our Greenville facility, the team used lean to cut the distance that a single part travels
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:16.300]   during production from three miles, yes, three miles, to a mere 165 feet, flashing the time
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.860]   it took to make that part by 42%.
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.740]   These are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.540]   environment.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.100]   So that's our approach here.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:34.420]   We're facing the pandemic head on while continuing to execute our long term strategy for GE.
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.740]   Moving to slide three, you'll find a snapshot of our first quarter results, and Carolina
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.580]   will take you through this in detail, but first a few top line thoughts.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.820]   As I noted, we entered the year with momentum.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:51.820]   However, as COVID-19 continued to spread globally, and I'm not going to sugarcoat this, we got
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:57.460]   hit hard in some of our highest margin parts of our best performing businesses.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.620]   This is especially true at aviation services, where COVID-19 caused a rapid decline in commercial
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:09.220]   aviation demand, and even essential travel became difficult in the second half of March.
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.140]   A similar situation also transpired at power services, where travel restrictions caused
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.100]   by COVID-19 impacted our field personnel.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.380]   Then across all of our businesses, we started to see some project fulfillment and execution
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.380]   issues.
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.420]   At the same time, healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.580]   in the fight against COVID-19.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.380]   Taking a step back, about 80% of our roughly $400 billion backlog is in services, which
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.940]   have a long time horizon, and while services have been hurt in the near term, those capabilities
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.060]   remain one of our greatest strengths.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.220]   They keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships, especially through
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.180]   periods of volatility.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.100]   So in the spirit of embracing reality, let me frame for you what we're seeing right now
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.940]   at a high level, and then I'll do a deeper dive after Carolina reviews the first quarter.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.500]   In aviation and at G-Cast, airlines are conserving cash, not flying the planes they have, limiting
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.460]   maintenance spare, spend where they can, and all the while deferring orders in many places.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.780]   No one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume, but the reality
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.540]   is likely it's not soon.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.020]   So we're redefining winning.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:30.820]   From margin expansion in 2020 to improving our decriminal margins this year, which requires
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.540]   we aggressively adjust our cost structure.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.900]   That's what winning looks like for aviation, and they're moving forward with a comprehensive
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.900]   plan.
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:44.180]   To be clear, we'll get back to targeting those 20% operating margins post pandemic.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.940]   In healthcare, we've been on the front lines, combating COVID-19 since the early days in
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.820]   Wuhan.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.660]   This is fundamental to our mission.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.060]   While we've seen demand surge for certain products, other products, including those in our high
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:04.040]   margin pharmaceutical diagnostics business, have been negatively impacted as multiple
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.060]   procedures are deferred.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:12.260]   Healthcare is likely to rebound faster than aviation, but we're still fast tracking additional
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:18.820]   cost out actions targeting an incremental $700 million since Karen and the team spoke with
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.540]   you in December.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.060]   Empower and renewable energy, the impact of COVID-19, has been more limited to date.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.860]   Specifically at power, we're experiencing outage delays and restrictions in field service
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.540]   travel, and we're monitoring new unit orders and services.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.260]   To offset this, we're further right sizing the cost structure, and in power, we already
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.380]   reduced headcount by 700 in the first quarter.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.060]   Clearly, across GE, there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point, including
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:57.660]   the full duration, magnitude, and pace of recovery across our end markets, operations, and supply
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.660]   chains.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.820]   We're also monitoring how the resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.820]   and our runoff insurance business.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.700]   Let me tell you what we do know.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.580]   The second quarter will be the first full quarter with pressure from COVID-19, and we expect
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:20.780]   that our financial results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:26.060]   The bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead, but this too shall pass.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:32.340]   I'm confident the underlying reset we took over the last 18 months to focus GE's portfolio
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.420]   and instill a greater focus on customers and lead give us a running start for what we face
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.820]   today.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:45.900]   Moreover, I see in our response to COVID-19 signs of how we're moving faster to change
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:51.620]   GE for the good, more to re-work to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:57.140]   in aviation, travel restrictions spurring on the use of remote digital technology to complete
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:02.900]   fieldwork and renewables, and more capital discipline across the board, with new leaders
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:08.580]   assimilating faster and with real impact, health care comes to mind.
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.940]   So all of this in combination with the planned actions we'll discuss later are accelerating
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.660]   our transformation of GE.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.980]   With that, I'll turn it over to Carolina, but before I do, let me say how pleased I am
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.500]   to have her on board.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:26.100]   In two short months, it's clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.820]   operational bias for action and executing with speed.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.600]   Thank you, Larry.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:41.340]   I am proud to join my first earnings call at CFO of GE and help lead this company forward.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.260]   As you noted, we're operating in unprecedented times.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:50.980]   I'll be focused on first keeping our financial position strong and safe with a keen eye on
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.700]   leverage and liquidity as well as cash flow and capital discipline.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.860]   While GE's actions over the last couple of years have put us on stronger footing ahead
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.620]   of this situation, we will do more.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.800]   Second, working with our businesses to take the right action, not only to help mitigate
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:14.180]   the impact of COVID-19, but to serve customers better, operate smarter and more efficiently
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.620]   and integrate lean more holistically.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.460]   While Larry and I are focused on the near term, we're also managing for the long term.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:26.540]   We're working together to reduce complexity at GE and build a lean culture that delivers
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.020]   sustainable earning and cash flow generation.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.460]   Today, my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.100]   help you see what I see across the businesses.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.140]   With that, let's turn to slide four.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:47.540]   This was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated, taking
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.300]   it from the top.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.620]   First quarter orders were down 3% organically or down four ex biopharma.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:00.220]   Equipment in power and healthcare was affected by double digit decline in aviation and renewables.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.380]   Both equipment and service orders were down low single digits.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.740]   I'll cover this by business shortly.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.300]   Industrial revenue was down 5% organically or down six ex biopharma, with equipment revenue
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.740]   flat and services down 9%.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:22.300]   Both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID-19.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.260]   But industrial profit margins were down 450 basis points organically.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.460]   Most of the dilution came from aviation and renewables, with the aviation impact mostly
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.460]   driven by COVID-19.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:40.820]   Now let's discuss the EPS work, starting at continuing EPS of 72 cents.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:47.100]   There was a 75 cents gain primarily related to the 11.5 billion of tax gain from the biopharma
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.740]   sale, which also included one cent of tax benefit in geotapidol.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.860]   This was partially offset by a 4.6 billion after tax loss on our remaining Baker-Huge
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.300]   stake, which we measure at fair value edge quarter.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.700]   On restructuring and other items, we incurred two cents of charges.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.660]   This is principally related to the reduction of aviation's US workforce.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:17.060]   Lastly, non-operating pension and other benefit plans were a six cents headwind in the quarter.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.700]   Including these items, adjusted EPS was 5 cents.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.060]   As described earlier, our earnings performance was materially impacted by COVID-19 and other
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.060]   market dynamics.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:32.500]   This was primarily in aviation and geocapture, with negative marks and impairments in both
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.900]   g-cash and insurance, as well as higher credit costs.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:43.980]   We estimate the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from COVID-19 roughly 700 million.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.100]   This included lower aftermarket sales, project delays, and supply chain constraints.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:55.500]   This impact is higher than anticipated at the March outlook call, reflecting the rapid global
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.380]   progression of the pandemic, while our prior forecasts largely reflected the slowdown
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.380]   in China.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.980]   Our focus on addressing this pandemic is global.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.220]   We're targeting more than 2 billion of costs out this year, while this may not affect
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.180]   the full impact, we're rapidly addressing both cost and cash, and making our businesses more
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.980]   agile and customer focused over time.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:22.820]   I can tell you from my experience that as these programs build momentum, and the company leaders
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:28.020]   begin to see how powerful results can be, they tend to extend beyond their stated goals.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:33.220]   With just what I have seen so far, I'm encouraged that we can have some of that failed experience
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.220]   achieved.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:41.140]   Moving to cash, as many of you know, the first quarter is typically low for our free cash
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.140]   flow.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:48.460]   This year, we're impacted by our usual seasonality, but also COVID-19, especially in aviation.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.740]   Industrial free cash flow was a use of 2.2 billion, one billion worse than prior year.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:59.220]   But notably excluding aviation, each industrial business improved free cash flow versus last
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.220]   year.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:06.140]   Turning to the key drivers in the quarter, starting with net earnings.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:11.980]   If you exclude the biopharm again and the market on our Bakehubes investment, income depreciation
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:17.940]   and amortization total 700 million, that's down 900 million versus prior year.
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:24.940]   Next, working capital, negative 2.6 billion, with a significant use of cash, down 1.1 billion.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.580]   Let me take it through the main factors.
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:33.620]   First, we had the net inflow in accounts receivable, driven by seasonally lower volume in gas power
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.620]   and renewables.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:40.500]   Second, we had an outflow in accounts cable, driven by lower volume in aviation and higher
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.620]   disbursements related to prior year material buys in renewables.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:50.300]   Third, we increased inventory to support an expected second and third quarter volume
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.780]   ramp in onshore wind and shop output declined in aviation.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:18:00.300]   Fourth, progress collections, they were a use of cash as new orders and milestone payments
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.220]   were more than effected by burn down of prior progress payments in power and renewables.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.940]   Lastly, we also spent about 600 million in gross capital.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:15.700]   We don't track now to reduce 25 percent of our capital spend this year.
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:21.540]   For cash flow in total, we estimate the first quarter impact from COVID-19 of around 1 billion,
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.020]   the majority of which was felt in aviation.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.700]   As we look forward, we expect continued free cash flow pressure.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.620]   We're targeting more than 3 billion in cash action.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.200]   However, over time, we know that each business can be a better cash generator as we improve
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.460]   execution.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.740]   Moving to slide six, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.700]   Largest milestone in the quarter was closing by a pharma.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:55.300]   With 20 billion of proceed, we ended the quarter with 33.8 billion of industry cash up approximately
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.380]   16 billion sequentially.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:04.700]   TA capital ended with 13.5 billion of cash down approximately 5.3 billion sequentially driven
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.220]   by contractual majorities.
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.700]   We continue to hold a liquidity balance covering 12 months of G debt majorities.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:18.780]   We've recently taken actions to enhance and extend our liquidity and pay down debt.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:24.700]   On April 17, GE entered into a three-year 15 billion syndicated revolving credit facility.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:32.020]   This was a planned refinancing of GE's prior 20 billion syndicated revolver credit facility,
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.020]   including bilateral agreements.
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:39.420]   We expect to have in the range of 20 billion in total credit lines accessed going forward.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.100]   Following the sale of biopharma, we also improved our liquidity profile in April.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:50.420]   We reduced our near-term debt majorities by issuing 6 billion in GE debt in April, and subsequently
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.100]   tendering for 4.2 billion of debt.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.780]   We plan to use the remaining 1.8 billion of proceeds to further debt reduction, and the
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.420]   combination of transaction will therefore be leveraged neutral.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:10.580]   GE industrial has no debt majorities in 2021, 1.9 billion of majorities in 2022, and 900
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.500]   billion in 2023.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.300]   At GE industrial, we reduced debts by approximately 7 billion.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.140]   We reduced commercial paper used by 1.1 billion in the quarter, and we paid 6 billion of the
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:29.460]   intercompany loan from GE to GE capital in April, using proceeds from biopharma.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:35.060]   At GE capital, we reduced debt by 4 billion, so we reduced external debt by 10 billion
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:41.580]   yesterday, including 4.7 billion of majorities in the quarter, and an additional 5.4 billion
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:48.420]   of 2020 majorities tended in April, offset by GE's 6 billion repayment from the intercompany
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.420]   loan.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:58.060]   Our financial policy goals remain, maintaining a high cash balance, achieving less than 2.5
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:05.500]   times net debt to EBDA at GE industrial, and less than 4 times debt to equity at GE capital.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:11.220]   Accredit rating in the single A range, and reinstating a dividend in line with peers over
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.220]   time.
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.660]   We remain committed to achieving our leveraged targets, but we now expect to achieve those
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:23.340]   targets over a longer period than previously and not due to the impact of COVID-19.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:28.500]   Next on slide 7, we'll discuss industrial segment results.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.500]   Starting with aviation.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.140]   As you've noted, our first quarter results were materially impacted.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.780]   Orders were down 13 percent organically, with both equipment and service orders down.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.740]   Equipment orders were down 27 percent, primarily driven by commercial engines business, due
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.580]   to the max grounding and the COVID impact.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:54.020]   Services orders were down 4 percent, primarily driven by commercial services, partially offset
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:59.900]   by military, which one new fighter and helicopter service orders from the U.S. DOD.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.900]   Service orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders, which were up 60
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.380]   percent year-over-year.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:13.580]   Backlog of 273 billion was flat sequentially, and up 22 percent versus prior years, primarily
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.500]   driven by long-term service agreements.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:22.340]   This included roughly 200 litre 1B unit order cancellations in the quarter.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.540]   Revenue was down 11 percent organically.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:31.580]   Equipment revenue was down 17 percent, we shipped 472 commercial install and spare engine units
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.620]   this quarter, down 37 versus prior years.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:44.980]   Sales of 272 litre 1A and 1B units were down 152, and CFM 56 units were down 98 units.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:51.780]   Service revenue was down 8 percent, due to commercial services down 11 percent.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:57.620]   This was driven by lower spare parts shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of COVID-19.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:04.180]   30 military revenue was down 7 percent, with 146 engine unit shipments down 9 percent.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:09.940]   And this was driven by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound material aid, partly
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:16.980]   assessed by the advanced programs growth, operating profit was down 39 percent organically, primarily
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.820]   on lower volume and negative mix pressure in commercial services from the impact of COVID-19
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.260]   and lower spare engine units.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:32.820]   Segment margin contracted 650 basis points organically, and this was primarily due to COVID-19, impacting
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:40.500]   our commercial businesses in both engines and services, the continued 737 MAX grounding,
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:46.100]   the nonrepeat of prior year favorable contract adjustments, and the first full quarter of revenue
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.940]   from our aerodrivetive business, now that we have deconsolidated Baker Fuze.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:56.180]   To add a bit more color, COVID-19 represents just over half of the year-over-year margin
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.180]   difference.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:02.420]   737 MAX timing, considering install and spare engine volume, and supply chain excess
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:08.020]   costs represent additional 20 percent of the value.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.980]   Moving to healthcare, which performed well.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:16.340]   Orders were up 9 percent organically, equipment orders were up 14 percent, and services were
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.340]   up 1.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:22.100]   Healthcare orders, excluding biopharma, were up 6 percent, driven by a surge demand related
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.100]   to COVID-19.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.660]   This was partially assessed by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.660]   to COVID-19.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:35.260]   Examples like MR and interventional in healthcare systems, as well as contrast media and nuclear
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:42.180]   traces from pharmaceutical diagnostics, life sciences orders were up 10 percent.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:48.580]   Backlog was 17.4 billion, down 6 percent sequentially, and down 3 versus prior year, due to the sale
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.580]   of biopharma.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:55.460]   So excluding biopharma, backlog was up 1 percent sequentially, and 4 versus prior year.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:01.140]   Revenue was up 2 percent organically, and 1 percent excluding biopharma.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.700]   Healthcare systems revenue was up 2 percent, with services, and 3 percent with equipment
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.780]   flat.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.660]   Life sciences was up 4 percent.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.900]   Operating profit was up 10 percent organically.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:18.380]   Segments margin expanded 140 basis points organically, or 30 basis points excluding biopharma.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:24.060]   This was driven by volume and cost productivity, or fed by price and logistics pressures from
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.540]   COVID-19.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:31.900]   Next, on power, we had mixed results, with equipment, top line strengths, or fed by challenges
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.260]   in services.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.100]   Orders were up 14 percent organically.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.860]   Gas power orders were up 8 percent, with equipment orders up 37 percent, largely due to one-term
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.860]   key orders.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:49.100]   We booked 2.2 gigawatt of orders for nine gas turbines.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.040]   Gas power service orders were down 3 percent, with contractual services down, and transaction
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.460]   and upgrades roughly flat.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.460]   Powered portfolio orders were up 27 percent, with strong equipment, and services orders
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.460]   in student and power conversion.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:09.260]   Backlog closed at 85 billion, flat sequentially, and down 1 percent versus prior year.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.380]   Gas backlog was 71 billion, flat sequentially.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:18.100]   Revenue was down 12 percent organically, largely driven by services.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:24.260]   And gas power revenue was down 12 percent, gas power equipment revenue was up 4 percent
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:31.980]   organically, on higher H-Turbine mix, we shipped seven gas turbines versus nine gas turbines
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.100]   in the first quarter of 19.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:39.180]   We helped our customers achieve commercial operations on over 32 units, translating almost
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:44.020]   4.7 gigawatts of new power added to the grid.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:50.660]   Gas power services revenue was down 19 percent, as outages, this and transaction sales pushed
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:55.980]   out of the quarter due to COVID-19, and we had lower revenue on higher margin upgrades.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.980]   Despite this, services would still have been down in the quarter.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:04.580]   This was driven by supply-based constraints on hot gas, part parts, and outage costs
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.580]   overall, pressuring our CSA margin rate.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.580]   Power portfolio revenue was down 12 percent.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.460]   This was driven by lower volumes across the subsegment.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.820]   And still, we had lower services, back low convertibility, in nuclear, the decline was
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.740]   driven by outage timing, and in power conversion, we refined our sales parameter, focused on
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.140]   higher margin market segments.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:36.300]   Operating profit was down 239 million, and segment margin contracted 570 basis points organically.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:41.500]   While gas power fixed costs were down 9 percent sequentially and 16 versus prior year, this
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:48.780]   was more than offset by lower service volume and additional costs from COVID-19 disruption.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.100]   Next are renewables.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.980]   Continue revenue growth was more than offset by fulfillment and execution issues impacting
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.980]   profitability.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:02.740]   Orders were down 11 percent organically, equipment were down 11, as we cycle a stronger
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.620]   U.S. PTC, and services were down 23 percent.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:12.660]   A positive spot in the quarter was international orders, which were up 11 percent.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:20.740]   Backlog of 26.5 billion was down 4 percent sequentially, but up 5 percent versus prior year.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.900]   Revenue was up 28 percent organically.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.020]   This was mainly driven by onshore wind, up 60 percent.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:34.220]   Onshore equipment revenue was up 81 percent, with the new unit turbine delivery of 731 more
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:40.940]   than double prior year, and repower kit delivery of 219, up 40 percent.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:46.260]   Onshore services revenue excluding repower kits was up 15 percent.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:52.340]   Onshore order pricing index continues to stabilize at 1 percent in line with recent trends.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.940]   Grid revenue was down 8 percent, mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones driven
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.620]   by COVID-19.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.820]   Operating loss was down 115 million.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:07.780]   This was driven by the supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, fulfillment delays, and
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.420]   the non-recurrence of a non-cash gain from an offshore wind contract termination in the
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.920]   prior year.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.420]   This was partially offset by higher onshore wind volume.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.100]   Segment margin contracted 210 basis points, mainly driven by the same items mentioned
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:30.660]   above, and the range of execution issues we're fixing at grid and hydro.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.820]   Moving to slide 8, starting with GA Capital.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:40.220]   In the quarter, adjusted continue operations generated a net loss of 118 million.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:45.620]   This excludes the impact of the capital loss tax benefit utilized against biopharm again
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.460]   resulting in 88 million earnings.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:55.020]   Back to prior year, which excludes the U.S. tax reform benefit, continuing net earnings
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.420]   was unfavorable by 154 million.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:03.700]   This was due to negative marks and impairments at GCAS and insurance, lower gains and lower
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.140]   earnings from a smaller asset base.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.660]   This was partially offset by lower excess interest costs and SG&A.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.700]   We ended the quarter with 101 billion of assets, excluding liquidity.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.780]   This was done 1 billion sequentially, primarily driven by GCAS due to asset sales, depreciation
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.740]   and collections, partially offset by new volume.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:29.820]   Insurance assets were flat sequentially as the decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:36.660]   by higher market rates was offset by the annual insurance capital contribution.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.060]   Supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continued to migrate to MUFG.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:48.220]   As noted earlier, capital ended the quarter with 13.5 billion of liquidity.
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:54.540]   Capital also ended with 54.5 billion of debt, which was down 4.5 billion sequentially, driven
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.420]   by debt maturity.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:02.780]   This continued operation generated a net loss of 164 million, which was unfavorable versus
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.980]   prior year by 200 million.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.860]   We still plan to provide the required support to GE Capital in line with insurance tax
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.220]   or funding.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:18.100]   Next, just like our businesses, corporate needs to adjust to our new reality and we are continuing
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:24.500]   to take additional structural actions to rationalize costs and reduce the size at corporate.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:31.220]   Looking at the quarter, adjusted corporate costs were 374 million, 8% higher, but that's primarily
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:35.700]   due to higher inter-company profit eliminations, which were partially offset by better digital
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.740]   performance from continued cost reduction actions.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:46.100]   Actions and operations were 25% lower, primarily driven by GE Digital's improvement.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.140]   You can see from Digital's performance that the focused cost reduction programs are gaining
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.140]   traction.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:56.940]   We continue to right-size our functional costs across GE and push more accountability into
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.460]   the divisions.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.300]   Larry and I are conducting cost and cash reviews of each of the businesses with fresh
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:08.140]   eyes in the current environment, so you can expect that there will be more to come.
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.680]   Stay tuned.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:15.980]   I have spent most of my career in leadership at lean decentralized companies.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:21.460]   Fundamentally, I believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers businesses
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.580]   to take the right actions quickly.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:29.860]   This type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with COVID-19,
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.100]   but also to be prepared to pivot to growth.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.740]   We're working toward this goal and there will be more to come.
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:41.780]   With that, back to you Larry.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:46.620]   Carolina, thank you.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:51.580]   There's no question that COVID-19 is putting real pressure on our businesses.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:55.860]   Given that so much has changed and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:01.620]   from COVID-19, I'd like to spend some time here discussing second quarter trending based
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.220]   on what we're seeing through the month of April.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.340]   So starting with aviation on slide nine.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:13.180]   Of all of our industrial segments, this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.660]   severely.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.500]   The rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.580]   airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:29.060]   We'll cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail, but on the
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.980]   other end of the spectrum, demand for our military business remains strong.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:38.660]   To that end, we rebalanced some of our capacity to meet this increased demand.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:44.540]   To offset some pressure in the commercial business, we're taking several steps that while painful
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.140]   preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:55.580]   We've previously announced $500 to $1 billion in costs and cash actions and we've now increased
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:34:02.900]   this targeting more than $1 billion in cost actions and more than $2 billion in cash actions.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:08.060]   This will be achieved through different initiatives, some of which have been completed others in
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.060]   flight as we speak.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:15.100]   These include a 10% reduction in aviation's total U.S. workforce and furloughs impacting
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:22.620]   50% of its U.S. maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufacturing will
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.940]   continue to monitor and potentially extend as required.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:35.500]   We're also focused on reducing the discretionary and cap expense and optimizing working capital.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.780]   I know aviation's decremental margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.620]   and Carolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.060]   While we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the second
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:53.420]   quarter, our expectations are that the cost actions we're undertaking will improve decremental
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.660]   margins in the back half of the year.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.500]   While there are many uncertainties, I expect that we will exit the year with a much lower
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.940]   decremental margin than what you saw in the first quarter, so make no mistake, driving
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.820]   improvement here is our number one focus.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.660]   As we think about the full year, we're tracking travel restrictions, carrier and passenger
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:19.020]   behavior, disease countermeasures and freight demand, all of which will impact aircraft
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.740]   departures and revenue passenger kilometers.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:27.780]   While we're seeing an unprecedented decline in 2020, we're taking action and David and
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:34.780]   the team are working proactively with our customers to navigate through this crisis.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.900]   So spending a little more time on commercial services, which represented $3.3 billion of
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.700]   revenue in the first quarter, let's go to slide 10.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.420]   As you can see on the left side, departures across the full industry were strong in the
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.220]   first quarter before rapidly declining in mid-March.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:54.980]   As we look at it this week, focused on the GE and CFM fleet, global departures are down
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.140]   approximately 75%.
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.860]   Roughly 60% of the CFM fleet is parked today.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.140]   In line with this, we're also seeing significant headwinds in global shop visits, which were
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.100]   down low double digits in the first quarter as airlines defer short-term maintenance and
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:17.060]   we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better, with some potential to moderate in
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.740]   the latter half of the year, depending on the variables just outlined.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.220]   Based on what we're seeing through the month of April in the second quarter, we're seeing
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:31.540]   shop visits down roughly 60% and CSA billings down roughly 50%.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:37.540]   Additionally, we expect this significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.140]   our CSA margins.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:45.700]   That said, when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time, GE is well
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:51.420]   positioned with the largest and youngest installed base of all engine manufacturers.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:59.460]   Additionally, roughly 62% of our GE CFM fleet has seen one shop visit or the last and this
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.220]   will generate demand upon recovery.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.980]   We have more narrow bodies that are 10 years or younger than the narrow body installed
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.540]   base of the rest of the industry.
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.340]   And when we see a pickup and air travel demand, we expect narrow bodies will recover most
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.340]   quickly.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:21.260]   Overall, it was a challenging quarter and we're expecting additional pressure here in the
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:26.500]   second, but our cost actions will alleviate some of the pressure in the second half of
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.500]   2020.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:34.860]   Moving to commercial engines, which represented $1.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter,
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.140]   in light of COVID-19, airframeers are producing at a lower rate.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:43.140]   Based on what we're seeing through the month of April, in the second quarter, we see installed
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:49.460]   engines down roughly 45% and spare engines down roughly 60% year-on-year, attributable
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:54.140]   to the delivery deferrals in addition to the already planned lower production rate on
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.460]   the 737 MAX.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:02.860]   In the near term, we're rightsizing production capacity and actively managing the supply base.
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.860]   We have very strong relationships with the air framers and an attractive value proposition
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.660]   is evidenced by a multiyear backlog.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:14.100]   As you'll see on the right, we have strong positions, sole source on two of the biggest
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.220]   new engine entrants, and a 65% win rate on the other.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.380]   While we acknowledge there's pressure on near term demand for new aircraft, these stats
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:29.060]   demonstrate that customers see the value of GE technology.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:35.020]   We're taking the right actions to be well positioned for the post pandemic world.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.900]   We're seeing healthcare, which consists of healthcare systems and PDX.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:44.220]   In the second quarter to date, we're seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.500]   in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 within healthcare systems.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:53.540]   Now, these product orders, including ventilators, have increased one and a half to two times
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:59.140]   versus pre-pandemic levels, but at the same time, we're seeing reduced demand for other
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:04.700]   diagnostic products as certain procedures are deferred or canceled around the world.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:09.100]   To be clear, these other diagnostics are still essential and often associated with saving
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:15.420]   lives in areas including oncology and cardiology, but are currently deprioritized.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.780]   PDX is a similar story.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.180]   This is a high margin this is made of contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.300]   procedures that are being deferred or canceled right now.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:35.140]   HPCS product lines and most of PDX is down as much as 50% versus pre-pandemic levels.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.380]   While these dynamics vary by country, there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.140]   experience different stages of the virus.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:48.100]   Taking China, for example, as hospitals come back online, we're seeing a ramp in previously
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:53.740]   deferred procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:59.300]   Here is accelerating its planned transformation to expand margins post-biopharma by reducing
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:06.460]   headcount, fixed costs, discretionary spend and marketing spend, prioritizing R&D, deferring
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:11.020]   CAPX, and optimizing working capital.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.940]   Looking forward, we're most focused on the following indicators for healthcare, hospital
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:20.700]   admission and occupancy rates, an increase in non-COVID-19 procedures, changes in hospital
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:26.980]   CAPX budgets, government spending on healthcare broadly, and development of COVID-19 test treatments
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.780]   and vaccines.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.300]   Based on our experience in China and the market in April, we expect to be down in the second
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.620]   quarter with potential recovery afterwards.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:45.260]   COVID-19 has highlighted the need to build and truly invest and scale a new digitized infrastructure
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.260]   and quickly.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:51.420]   We're committed to our investment in our digital Edison platform and solutions like Neural
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:57.100]   Virtual Care Solution, which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous ventilated patients
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:05.220]   simultaneously, helping to expand their capacity while reducing their risk of exposure.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.460]   As our digital healthcare journey continues, we're at the center of an ecosystem striving
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.740]   for precision health.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:17.980]   I'm very proud of the work our team is doing to combat COVID-19.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:23.820]   Moving to power on slide 13, we'll talk to the current trending in the second quarter
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:29.180]   to date in dynamics of gas power and power portfolio.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.540]   Starting with gas power equipment, while we're monitoring and managing supply chain disruptions,
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:39.940]   as of today, we still see a path to 45 to 50 gas turbine deliveries this year.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.940]   But our orders profile, and therefore cash down payments worth several hundred million
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:50.260]   dollars are likely weaker due to IPP pressures in the U.S. and Mexico, as we expect that deal
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.940]   financing will become harder through the year.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:42:00.540]   Additionally, with oil price pressure impacting Middle East and SSA investment, including
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:06.020]   demand for new LNG, we are expecting a longer road to normalization.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:13.340]   Ultimately, we're sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin accreted backlog
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.980]   with disciplined execution.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.460]   In services, approximately 20 percent of planned outages are shifting from the first half of
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.020]   this year due to COVID-19 field labor constraints.
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:28.700]   We're also seeing pressure on upgrades, primarily in the Middle East, where low oil prices are
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.180]   impacting customer budgets.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:36.660]   We are seeing GE gas turbine utilization in the U.S. up mid-single digits due to low gas
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:42.940]   prices and the shift from coal, but utilization globally is down low double digits due to lower
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.900]   electricity demand.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.940]   Within power portfolio, our steam business is most impacted.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.700]   Factory closures pressured our steam operations, including one facility in Wuhan, which was
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.860]   closed for approximately eight weeks in the first quarter.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.720]   Today, we're back up to more than 70 percent of capacity.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.340]   The global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in India driven by government
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.340]   restrictions.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:13.460]   Overall, we're seeing about 30 percent of outages shift from the first half of this year to
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:19.540]   the second half, with another 10 to 15 percent pushing into next year.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.540]   Our power businesses are taking several measures to offset these pressures.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:30.620]   In the first quarter, we reduced headcount by 700, notified approximately 1,300 contractors,
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:35.740]   implemented a hiring freeze, and in line with the demand profile, we are taking even further
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.460]   actions.
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:44.580]   This will serve to reduce fixed costs in 2020 and drive benefits in 2021.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.780]   Looking forward, we're tracking a number of items, including timing of our gas turbine
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:53.860]   new order closure, service outages and volume, leak utilization as the energy mix, and fuel
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:59.820]   prices are impacting each region differently, supplier impacts, and project execution, billing
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.500]   milestones, and customer collections.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:09.260]   We're targeting to have our accelerated cost-out measures drive organic margin expansion despite
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.020]   these demand changes.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:17.740]   Moving to slide 14 on renewables, there was a limited impact of COVID-19 in the first
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:23.700]   quarter, and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:28.300]   As we've said, we think about renewables in three distinct operating pools.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:33.700]   Starting with onshore wind, while we continue to deliver at record levels in the Americas,
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:38.580]   we are seeing supply chain disruption at our LM wind facilities, and we're monitoring
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:43.540]   key commercial milestones such as permitting and financing, which could potentially cause
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.980]   timing delays.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:52.900]   In offshore wind, certification for our industry-leading turbine, the Holleyot X, remains on track.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:59.460]   We're also on plan to start delivering on our 80-unit 6 megawatt commitments to EDF.
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:03.740]   After completion of this project in 2021, we expect to start shifting production to the
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.740]   Holleyot X.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:10.500]   We're also monitoring financial closure of 2020 deals.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.940]   Grid and Hydro, our two turnarounds, are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.820]   of our grid facilities now operating below full capacity.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:26.260]   At grid automation, we're also impacted by lower book-to-bill order conversion.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.620]   Across all three of these pools, we're increasing cost down and restructuring, and we've identified
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:34.420]   several hundred million dollars of additional actions.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:39.060]   Longer term, a lower cost structure will benefit renewables.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:43.340]   Relating to the global supply chain, we're focused on the safe reopening of our plants
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:48.780]   globally, and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.940]   Looking forward, we're expecting a larger impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter,
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:57.900]   and by business, we're tracking 20 and 21 demand impact on progress collections and potential
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:04.940]   site delays in onshore wind, the risk of financing delays associated with deals at offshore, project
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:11.900]   site delays at grid and hydro, and the backlog at grid.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.060]   On slide 15, within GE Capital, our GCAS and insurance businesses are where we are feeling
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:20.420]   the largest impacts, so I'll keep my comments focused there.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:26.660]   First, GCAS is better positioned today than in previous downturns, with better asset quality,
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:31.460]   less customer concentration, and more geographic diversity.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:37.140]   That said, we're preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments, as well as lease restructurings,
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:42.460]   and we've had approximately 80% of our customers seek short term deferrals.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:47.820]   As you may have seen, we've agreed with Boeing on a rebalancing of our 737 match order book.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:54.740]   Second, at insurance, market and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.940]   portfolio and reinvestment yields.
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:03.620]   Therefore, we're deploying capital to capture market dislocation investment opportunities.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:08.880]   We're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.500]   And similar to the industrial segments, we're implementing incremental cost and cash actions.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:18.540]   Looking forward, we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales at GCAS and
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.620]   insurance.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:25.340]   Our seasoned teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period.
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:29.300]   So, to close, our priorities are clear.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.800]   We rapidly mobilized our team in the face of COVID-19, with our top priority being the
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.540]   health and safety of our employees.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:44.620]   And overall, the priorities we reviewed with you at the outlet call remain intact.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.860]   We're facing into our near term realities while continuing to manage GE for the long term.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:55.220]   When the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century, our team is rising to the challenge
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:48:00.260]   with humility, transparency and focus.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:05.620]   We continue to deliver value for our customers, enabling air carriers to transport essential
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:11.540]   goods, supplying vital health care equipment and keeping the lights on.
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:15.300]   And while there are many unknowns, there will be another side.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.220]   Planes will fly again.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:20.820]   Health care will normalize and modernize.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.300]   And the world still needs more efficient, resilient energy.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.380]   At the same time, we're embracing this new reality.
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.940]   We're redefining winning and we're executing our plan.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:38.660]   The costs and cash that we've taken you through this morning are a major result.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:43.700]   These moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multi-year transformation to make GE a
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.660]   stronger, number and more valuable company.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.380]   And I am confident that GE will emerge stronger.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.500]   With that, Steve, let's go to questions.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.500]   Great.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:01.740]   Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:07.460]   again and ask one question and a follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.740]   Brandon, can you please open the line?
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:11.020]   Yes, thank you, sir.
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:13.180]   We'll now begin the question and answer session.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.340]   If you have a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.300]   If you'd like to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hashtag
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   key.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.780]   If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up your handset first before dialing.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:30.380]   Once again, if you have a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.660]   And from vertical research, we have Jeff Sprague.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.940]   Please go ahead.
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:35.940]   Thank you.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:36.940]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.940]   Help everyone as well.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.380]   Thanks for all the great details.
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.380]   Good morning, Jeff.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.380]   Good morning.
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:51.140]   I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on how you kind of view the asset
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:56.540]   quality of the contractual service agreements and the like, like there's a lot of assets
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:57.540]   there.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.860]   Obviously, there's at least a temporary impairment of cash flows.
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.020]   How does that test work?
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.380]   Have you done it yet?
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:10.780]   And are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should be thinking about?
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:27.060]   Jeff, I think if we look at the service backlog, broadly, just under $325 billion for the company,
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:31.100]   the vast majority of that $234 billion is in aviation.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.860]   I suspect that's where you're most focused.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:44.300]   We go through those backlog reviews and the CSA reviews on a regular basis.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:52.140]   What we've done here over the last, we call it the last seven, eight weeks, is really tighten
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:51:00.340]   and quicken the review process that we do with the businesses, both at aviation and at GCAS.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:08.020]   What we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest, and if you will, most accurate
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:14.420]   information possible with respect to customer risk given everything that's going on.
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.940]   So we do that on a regular basis.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.900]   We did that at the end of the first quarter in closing.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:27.660]   Much as we do every quarter, clearly, we've got a fluid situation.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:34.460]   I think the modest charges that we took, the modest changes in the first quarter, clearly
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.060]   are going to play out as we go through the course of the year.
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.900]   We can't really scope that for you today.
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:47.900]   If you look at the CSA book in aviation, for example, as we went through the mechanics
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:54.500]   of the future billings, the future costs related to those billings, based on the information
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:52:00.740]   at the time, it was really just $100 million adjustment, non-cash of course, which is why
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.740]   you see a little bit of the earnings, cash dynamic.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:11.980]   Certainly as we go forward, we're going to be updating those adjustments, and again,
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:18.340]   we would expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines are doing with
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.340]   their planes.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:24.460]   But I think it's important to keep in mind, again, these are 10 to 15 year agreements
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:32.240]   as you know, and those adjustments are taken in the context of that particularly extended
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.380]   time period.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:39.340]   Great, thanks for that, and just as a follow-up if I could, I know you don't want to get real
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:46.580]   precise on guidance, but you are pointing us to a further decline in cashflow in Q2, which
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:52.460]   isn't surprising quite frankly, but could you bracket that at all for us, what we should
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:53:00.180]   expect for Q2, and any high-level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint?
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:10.020]   Jeff, I think that we took guidance off the table a few weeks back, and didn't want to
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:16.660]   take an attempt at framing formal guidance here today in light of all of this flu, and
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.420]   all of it is still evolving here.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:24.860]   I think the tack we took was really to try to share as much with you as we possibly could
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:31.300]   in terms of the April detail of business by business, and acknowledge that we're going
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:37.740]   to see a more challenging second quarter here given the full impact of COVID and the like.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.140]   But beyond that, I think that's really where we are.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:45.540]   We know we've got to get to work on the cost and the cash actions.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:51.380]   That's why you see us doubling that activity and aviation, stepping it up elsewhere around
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:52.380]   the company.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:54:00.660]   So the $2 billion of cost, the $3 billion of cash will clearly help us later in the year
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:04.940]   as those actions take root.
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:09.500]   But for today, I think that's really what we're -- that's what we know, and that's what we're
[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:10.500]   comfortable sharing.
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.500]   Great.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:12.500]   Thanks.
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:13.500]   Best of luck, Larry.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.500]   Thanks.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:18.820]   For Morgan Stanley, we have Josh Pokers-Witzke.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:27.060]   Please go ahead.
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:31.060]   Josh, your line is open.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:37.420]   Josh, you might be on mute.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.980]   Why don't we -- Brandon, let's move on and come back to Josh.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:43.980]   Okay.
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:44.980]   Thank you for your answer.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:45.980]   Next question we have from Bank of America.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:46.980]   We have Andrew Olden.
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:47.980]   Please go ahead.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:48.980]   Yes.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:49.980]   Good morning.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.980]   Can you hear me?
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:52.980]   Andrew?
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:53.980]   Yep.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:54.980]   Andrew.
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:55.980]   Thank you very much.
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.980]   Yeah, just a question.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:57.980]   I can hear you.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:04.140]   Thank you so much, and good luck to everybody.
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:11.100]   So run rate minus 60 percent in terms of shop visits, 50 percent on CSAs, do you think you
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:16.860]   continue to trend at this level in the second quarter, or is there more downside?
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:25.780]   Andrew, the -- I think you're referring to page nine and the slide deck.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.780]   Yeah, the aviation.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:39.660]   I think this is what we're seeing right now, right, and given what the carriers have said
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:47.060]   publicly, what they're doing, we think these are good, likely, near-end run rates to share
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.060]   with you.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:54.060]   Again, we're not trying to offer up a definitive view as to the next several quarters, but
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:59.420]   this is what we're seeing right now in the second quarter, for sure.
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:06.500]   My follow-up question on spare engine sales, I think, minus 60 percent.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:11.860]   Have we lost these, or will these come back when the situation normalizes?
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:17.380]   Maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.380]   the next couple of years.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:21.180]   Thank you so much.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:34.340]   Andrew, we were ramping spares with both the LEAP 1A and the LEAP 1B as the narrowbody
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:42.700]   market was taking off, typical early in the life of an engine activity.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:50.140]   We are clearly seeing that soften, not necessarily going to zero, as preparations are being made
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:54.620]   for the return to service to the max, right?
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:59.020]   I don't think that opportunity is lost, but I think, like much of what we're seeing in
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:03.820]   aviation broadly, it will be pushed out for a few years.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:09.900]   Again, I don't think we're taking a definitive view as to what year, what quarter things
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:18.460]   get back to, if you will, a normalized 2019 level, but we recognize the discussions out
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:23.620]   there about this being a multi-year recovery, gradual, slow.
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:30.820]   I think we're embracing that reality, and that applies really across the portfolio, both on
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:36.340]   the OE side as well as the aftermarket, spares included.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.340]   Thank you very much.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.500]   Follow the detail and stay safe.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.500]   Thank you.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.500]   Thank you.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.940]   From Belius Research, we have Scott Davis.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:43.940]   Please go ahead.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:44.940]   Hey.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.260]   Good morning, guys, and welcome, Carolina.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.260]   Thank you.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.260]   Good morning, Larry.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:58:02.380]   Any way to think about the cost actions as it relates to kind of structural versus more
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:08.660]   kind of pandemic short term related?
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:09.660]   Sure.
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:17.380]   Well, I would say, Scott, as you well know, that when we're in a mode like this, you're
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:22.780]   moving as quickly as you possibly can almost anywhere that you can.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:28.420]   So if you look at what we've announced at Aviation, the doubling of those activities today, the
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:37.140]   broadening across the company, if you look at the tally today, there is a decidedly short
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:43.980]   term bias there that Carolina and I are going to be working with the CEOs over the coming
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:49.300]   weeks to transition to a more permanent action, right?
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:54.940]   If you look at what we did in Aviation, for example, in terms of the temporary lack of
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:59:00.540]   works, that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure in that business on a variable
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:07.380]   basis to these shockingly fast changes in demand.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.580]   You might categorize that as temporary.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:15.980]   We need to work through the changes on a more permanent basis that are required in light
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:19.260]   of the length of the recovery that we're looking at.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:25.820]   So we have confidence in these numbers that we're sharing today, the two billion of costs,
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.300]   the three billion of cash.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:33.500]   There's a bit of a tactical bias today, just given how fresh this is, but we will be leaning
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:38.420]   in toward making more of them permanent, recognizing that at the end of the day there
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:47.220]   will be a bit of a mix, be it head count related, discretionary spend on the cost side in addition
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:51.860]   to some of the work in capital and certainly the cap X reduction, the Carolina reference,
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:55.300]   the 25% reduction year on year.
[00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:04.580]   So a lot going on and by no means is these headlines today the end.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:06.500]   It's very much a work in progress.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:14.780]   Okay, that's helpful, Larry, and we think the $20 billion came to you pretty much about
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:20.980]   perfect timing, but does that money just have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:24.860]   is for the year, or is it just such a big number?
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:31.060]   You can start to parse some of it out thinking in terms of whittling down some of the debt
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:37.420]   that you can manage.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:44.700]   Well it did come at a good time.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.700]   There's no question.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:53.220]   That's why we put the emphasis in the biopharmist set up on certainty.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:58.260]   We wanted to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the healthcare
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:01.420]   options.
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:06.900]   Carolina, anything you want to add relative to managing liquidity versus leverage right
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:07.900]   here?
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:15.340]   Yeah, I think it's important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared to
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:20.340]   before COVID, and it's very important for us, of course leverage is important, but liquidity
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:27.540]   is very important, and we end the quarter with 47 billion cash, and that's really to cover
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:34.460]   18 billion of DUNJ capital long-term debt maturity is now through 21, and actually after the April
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:40.500]   action we are down to 13 billion of maturity for 2020-21, almost all of that in capital.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:46.340]   And I would also say, you know, we expect to have around 20 billion in total credit line
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:49.260]   going forward, and that's really in line with our risk appetite.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:58.020]   We have the new 15 billion three-year RCF that I mentioned, and five billion on either will
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:59.020]   be 20 billion of credit line.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.940]   And I think we just said that, you know, we really intend to maintain a high level of
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:03.940]   cash.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.220]   I would say to maximize flexibility.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:10.460]   And that's why we're taking these actions also to do risk balance sheet and basically
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:18.100]   prudently manage our liquidity in these very challenging external environmental time.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.100]   That makes sense.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.100]   Thank you, John.
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.100]   Good luck to you, guys.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.100]   Thank you.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.100]   Thanks, Scott.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.100]   Be well.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:30.340]   And let's try Josh Porkers-Winski again from Morgan Stanley.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.340]   Please go ahead, sir.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.340]   Hi, guys.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.340]   Can you hear me this time?
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:34.340]   Yes.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:35.340]   Yes.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.340]   Clearly, Josh.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.340]   Good morning.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.340]   Awesome.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:42.340]   And hope everyone is as well, that got earlier comments.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:47.700]   Larry, can you just give us a sense, and I know you guys have data going back, John, and
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:48.700]   aviation.
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:56.420]   But how the impact of retirements and cannibalizations, you know, kind of make more of a U-shape versus
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.580]   you know, what, you know, the air traffic may look like.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:06.900]   Is there a natural lag between when folks start flying again and when shop visits can happen
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:13.420]   just as a function of kind of using up some of the runtime on otherwise idle assets?
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:20.340]   Well, Josh, you know, certainly we have revisited the history.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:24.980]   The team is well-versed in what we have seen in years past.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:33.620]   I'm not sure we've seen anything kind of on par with this.
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:39.820]   But there's no question that there's going to be a bias on the part of some as some of
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:46.220]   these fleet reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft.
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:52.860]   And that will factor into the aftermarket, much like some of the dynamics around green
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:59.220]   time and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash, carriers try to preserve
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.960]   cash in their business.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:08.900]   So I'm not sure that there is necessarily an exact model that captures what all the carriers
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:13.100]   in Africa are going to do here, a model that offers great precision.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.740]   I think we do know that the combination of these factors is going to create pressure
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:22.340]   for us, for us here in the short term.
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:28.300]   I think what's most important for our business really is cycles, much more so than revenue
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.780]   passenger miles.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:37.620]   And as we see schedules come back as we work our way through the pandemic, that will put
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.280]   us back on, I think, better footing.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.540]   But here in the short term, I think we're acknowledging that we're going to see shop
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:48.740]   visits and CSA buildings take on some real pressure due to the downturn.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:49.740]   Understood.
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.740]   Thanks.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.480]   I'll leave it there.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.140]   From JP Borgen, we have Steve Tusa.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.140]   Thanks, Josh.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.140]   Hey, guys.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.140]   Good morning.
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.140]   Hey, Steve.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.140]   Good morning.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:11.700]   In early March, you guys had that slide that showed two to four billion in free cash flow
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.340]   guidance, which is obviously off the table.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:20.440]   But you also talked about things growing in 21 and 22 and off that kind of $3 billion base.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:29.540]   I think most research and numbers I saw were kind of in that $6 billion range of free cash
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.020]   flows to kind of growth off of that level.
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:40.500]   Are we still-- are the out-year numbers still at all legit, or are you kind of withdrawing
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.780]   that long-term outlook as well?
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:53.700]   Steve, I think we have admittedly been focused on taking the right actions, both the cost,
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:06:00.620]   the cash, the balance sheet actions here in the short term, in the face of this unprecedented
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.620]   pandemic.
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.340]   We've taken guidance off for the year.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:12.180]   We're not putting it back on today, just given the undue uncertainty of it all, right?
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:17.260]   So I don't think we're trying to get out any further than that.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:21.860]   I appreciate the question, but I think for purposes of today, we're really just trying
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:26.200]   to frame for folks what we're seeing.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:31.680]   But that said, however long it takes us to work through this, I think we feel very good
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:39.660]   about our ability to come out stronger and get back on a positive cash flow growth trajectory.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:40.660]   Got it.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:44.780]   Carolina, anything you would add to that?
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:52.380]   Well, no, I think it's important to acknowledge that by taking out costs now, and part of it
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:58.060]   being structural, that gives us sort of-- as well as mitigating the decrementals that
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:04.340]   helps improving the incrementals, the outer years, I mean, that will depend on the recovery
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:10.900]   on the industry as well, so that's, I would say, almost impossible to speak to today.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.900]   Right.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.260]   And I guess how much on that structural raw side?
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.260]   Go ahead.
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:22.380]   No, I'm just-- just one other point I think worth mentioning, and I think what we're acknowledging
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:28.060]   here is that assistance played out in March and what we're seeing already in April, right?
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:33.740]   It really is hitting us from a mixed perspective hard.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.740]   Our highest margin of businesses are really feeling it here.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:44.880]   I would think that on the recovery, we would see it swing the other way, but when we get
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:53.620]   back and come off a bottom, we should have positive mixed effect, really across the board
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:58.100]   particularly in aviation and healthcare.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.420]   Your second question, Steve, is relative to the cost actions and how much are permanent?
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:04.100]   How much?
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.100]   Not permanent?
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.100]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.020]   No, I guess how much is that going to cost you?
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:14.540]   I mean, like to come up with $2 to $3 billion of cost in cash, you know, you've cut your restructuring
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:18.740]   last year pretty significantly and needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:24.260]   I mean, most companies kind of one for one, how much is this stuff going to cost you
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:28.460]   this year on a cash basis?
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:37.580]   Yeah, I think what we have said previously is we were going to be down off of last year
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.300]   from an expense and from a cash perspective.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:45.920]   I think we're probably going to end up more or less in line, right?
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:52.780]   Keep in mind that some of the cost actions like furloughs don't carry restructuring charge
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:57.620]   with that, right, because they aren't permanent, so part of what we're trying to do is squeeze
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.300]   out some of the temporary costs.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:05.780]   But all the while, if we can make more structural moves, we want to make sure we've got room
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.780]   to do that.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:11.500]   But I'd say right now, assume that it'd be relatively flat year on year, but as Carolina
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:17.860]   indicated in her remarks, we want to try to do more if we can.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:18.860]   Great.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:19.860]   All right.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:20.860]   Thanks a lot.
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.860]   Best of luck, guys.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:22.860]   Thanks, Dave.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:23.860]   From UBS.
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:24.860]   We have Marcus Smittermeyer.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.860]   Please go ahead.
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:31.140]   Hi, good morning, Larry, Carolina and Steve.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.220]   Let me maybe follow up on the -- Marcus, good morning.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.500]   Hey, good morning.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:44.060]   Within the year, so in your 10Q, you referenced the YATA numbers of 48 percent RPK reduction.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:49.820]   And I know obviously flight hours and RPKs are two different stories, but is that sort
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:55.060]   of a kind of scenario that you're flying through internally?
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:00.340]   And I'm just trying to get a sense what that would mean if we look at our sort of like 19
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:05.700]   aviation cache as a baseline sort of like where, you know, on that type of scenario,
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:10.980]   we could end up particularly, you know, looking at sort of what you've mentioned in your preparedness
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:17.300]   remarks that you have, I think 62 percent of engines still ahead of shop visit one, which
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:21.540]   arguably are the engines that are on the narrowbodies coming back first because they're probably
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:25.220]   the youngest in the fleet.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.220]   Right.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:31.620]   Just trying to get a sense of within the year how you're thinking about stuff.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:42.260]   Well, I think that given what we highlighted relative to the April experience and the near
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:48.980]   term projection of that, there's no question that we're going to continue to see the pressure
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:53.860]   on cache at aviation that we've seen here of late.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.860]   Right.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:58.980]   And that will be our undoubtedly our biggest headwind.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:10.940]   No, sure, but, you know, shop visit, we heard sort of the numbers that you said, but did
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:19.820]   you do sort of internal stress test around where you could end up or is that just something
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.780]   that you said it's too early to comment?
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:35.420]   No, no, no, there's plenty of planning for, again, an extended slowdown here.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:39.580]   We're embracing this reality to the fullest extent possible.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:45.000]   We are not expecting this to bounce back in the near term.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.500]   So we flag in the queue the IOTA numbers.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.620]   We also reference others.
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:53.220]   You see it in our own departure data here in April, right?
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.740]   We are way down.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:59.900]   That has a direct feed in the shop visits, CSA billings and the like.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:08.820]   So we're adapting to this new environment, confident that it will recover, but we're simply
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:20.060]   not trying to assume the pressure abates any time soon witness the cost and the cash actions
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.060]   that we're taking.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.060]   Sure.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.060]   Okay.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.060]   No, I appreciate that.
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:30.820]   And maybe as a follow up quickly on the capital side, do you anticipate any change in the capital
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:34.060]   support there for insurance in particular?
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:39.280]   You referenced that a little bit in the prepared remarks, I think 2 billion is sort of the current
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.280]   number.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:46.420]   How are you thinking about that at the moment?
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:52.900]   On the parent support to capital and on the insurance, let's take a step back then.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:13:00.380]   So in 19, the capital had an inclusion from DU of 4 billion, right?
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:07.500]   And the estimate for this year is 2 billion on insurance funding.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:13.300]   And those 2 billion, you know, they're significantly lower than the year before.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.820]   We estimate that the parent will need to support rough in mind with this.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.220]   Some variables are still open and that depends on G capital itself, right?
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:27.620]   The G capital earnings, the LR2, the capital ending assets, liquidity level, but basically
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:30.780]   it's about 2 billion as it looks now.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:37.100]   And I would also say going forward, anticipating a follow up, we do continue to anticipate further
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:44.740]   funding and that would be again through a combination of G capital itself, LR2, liquidity
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:52.900]   and the future earnings and on top of that, possible capital contributions from G.
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:56.300]   Thank you.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:15.820]   So at Aviation, it sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up, the spares business, the
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:23.860]   aftermarket, the $15 billion commercial, aftermarket business will lag ASM growth because of a younger
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:30.980]   fleet emerging, you know, a surge of use serviceable material and the like, hard outs, and obviously
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:36.180]   lower spares provisioning as the OE rates come down 30% to 50%.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:43.940]   I guess first question is, when do you anticipate aviation free cash flow getting to break even?
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:50.540]   Is it even possible before calendar 22 in that type of environment?
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:58.380]   And then I have a follow up.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:04.300]   I'm not sure we would buy into the premise per se, right?
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:14.180]   I mean, we are a cycles business, much more so than any other indicator and the cycles
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:20.300]   are going to have to come back before the passengers do.
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:23.420]   As you indicated, the age of the fleet will help us over time.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:30.060]   There could be some short term headwinds, but we'll see how that plays out.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:37.940]   I think what we're acknowledging here is that we've been hit from a free cash perspective
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:50.100]   in our biggest and best cash generator at Aviation, but we're really not getting into much more
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:56.420]   in terms of the free cash forecast on a multiyear basis.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:57.420]   It's just too soon.
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:03.660]   There's just too many moving pieces for us to be that forward leaning at this point.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.660]   We wish we could be.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:08.660]   It's just not where we are.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.340]   And just to follow up, you know, obviously 2020 is a tough year.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:19.700]   We're going to have some cash burn, 2021 unclear, but certainly doesn't seem like an aviation
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:24.020]   we're going to have a strong recovery.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:27.980]   So as we emerge from this, we're going to have, you know, more leverage.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:32.860]   And I guess the question is, you guys have made some asset sales to deleverage.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:41.060]   What else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster?
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:46.980]   Is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore that's
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:51.380]   different than what you've done over the past year?
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:57.180]   Thank you.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:06.820]   Well, I'm not sure I would say that there's a lot that is -- oh, please, Carolina.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:16.580]   Well, I was going to say that to do things that we haven't done in the last couple of years.
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:17.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:27.020]   Well, I would just say at a high level, we are committed to our deleveraging target of less
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.100]   than two and a half times on the industrial side.
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:35.460]   And I think you've seen us make a lot of progress year to date, which I hope underscores the
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.660]   seriousness of that objective, both on the GE side, right?
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:44.700]   I think it's $7 billion of debt reductions in the quarter.
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:50.220]   And that capital hits up to $10 on a year to date basis given some of the things we did
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.220]   in April.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:59.100]   Clearly, it's going to take us a while longer here to hit those targets, like I suspect most
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:00.580]   companies.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:05.020]   But in terms of doing anything new or different, I think we're going to continue to try to run
[01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:12.420]   these businesses as best we can, be as disciplined as we can on the capital front, be smart and
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:19.060]   thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations, like pension as you've seen us, relative to
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:22.020]   the plan design and some of the settlement options.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:28.740]   So I'm not sure there are necessarily new plays per se, but we'll continue to look at every
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:33.060]   option available to continue to strengthen the company, strengthen the balance sheet, bring
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:37.180]   those leverage levels down in the face of COVID-19.
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:43.340]   Caroline, I'm sorry, I jumped in there, anything to add there?
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:48.660]   I would just add to the leverage comment also the liquidity that at times like this, you
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:53.220]   know, you do look at the liquidity and I think it's important to say that we really want
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:58.900]   to maintain a high level of cash to maximize the flexibility, and you have seen the de-risking
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:04.380]   activities that we have made to sort of push out the debt in the further years.
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:08.220]   So we keep optionality.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.220]   Thank you.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:15.060]   Yeah, but I think to that it meant it's just important for us all to remember we ended
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:21.820]   the quarter with 47 billion of liquidity on the back of the biopharma action and some of
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:23.820]   the other things that we have done.
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:31.060]   So we'll continue to be nimble and flexible, mindful of our obligations and our reality.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:37.100]   Okay, from Barclays, we have Julian Mitchell.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:38.260]   Please go ahead.
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.900]   Hi, good morning.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:42.900]   Maybe just a question.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:43.900]   Where are you Julian?
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:44.900]   Good morning.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:51.080]   Maybe just the first question around the working capital dynamics and the free cash flow at
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.080]   aviation.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:58.540]   I guess, you know, there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:05.540]   down draft, you get a working capital cash offset to an extent, and then it reverses whenever
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.820]   the sales come back.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:13.660]   Could you just update us on how you see the working capital cash impact at G Aviation sort
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:19.260]   of in the early stages now in this downturn, what you would expect to happen to working
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:22.580]   capital when things recover?
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:28.980]   If there's any major difference on the cash dynamics of the power by the hour type service
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:34.180]   relative to the ad hoc spares activity in aviation?
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:39.020]   Julian, I would say --
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:52.100]   Yeah, with respect to working capital.
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:58.460]   I think our primary challenge is really inventory at aviation, right?
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:04.700]   We came into this year knowing we were going to have to adjust to a different schedule
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:13.100]   with the MAX, chasing the step up at Airbus with the 320 NEO while dealing with a good
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:20.620]   bit of past due on the commercial side, both OE and aftermarket, while having pretty good
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:23.780]   military demand to contend with.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:31.760]   That all gets reset here, and one of the real pressures we saw from a cash flow perspective
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.740]   was an inventory at aviation in the quarter.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:41.540]   So that's where we're going to be most focused, trying to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies,
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:47.300]   adjust to the reduced production schedules, the lower aftermarket requirements while continuing
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:55.300]   to take care of the military business, that's a complex supply chain undertaking, but the
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:01.900]   team, as you can imagine, is keenly focused on using some of the lean tools, working with
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:08.540]   our supply base to make sure that we not only take the cost out of the business, but bring
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:17.660]   those inventory levels down in light of current demand.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:27.060]   But should we expect, so I guess I understand you're second part of your question, I may
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:28.060]   have missed that.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:37.260]   I guess in aviation you have the drop in EBITDA in the downturn, then the recovery in EBITDA
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.260]   in the early part of the upturn.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:46.180]   I was just trying to understand on working capital, is that cash impact counter cyclical
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:52.980]   or is it pro cyclical, so you're getting a working capital outflow through the downturn
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:23:02.540]   as well as the EBITDA decline?
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:07.660]   I understand the high level dynamic there that you're alluding to.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:13.860]   I think right now the simple reality of aviation given the pressures and the cross currents
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:17.780]   is that it is a negative and we need to work to improve it.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:24.380]   How much of a tailwind could it be, at this point in the cycle, I think it's too early
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:25.380]   to tell.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:32.420]   We've got to get on the improvement path first, Julian, to be able to take that potential
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:37.140]   and deliver it in the financials as a reality.
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.140]   Thank you.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:43.100]   And then my second question was just around the operational issues.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:48.780]   So I think it sounds like the cost out tailwind should build through the year, but in Q1 you
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:55.060]   had some operational issues in power on the service side, steep decrementals even with
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:24:02.260]   the fixed cost down 16%, renewables, the margins were down despite a big revenue increase.
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:08.100]   So I guess what's the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:15.040]   these cost savings over the balance of the year?
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:20.380]   Well I think you have to take it business by business, right?
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:28.340]   If you look at what happened in power, clearly the push out by customers because of their
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:34.660]   own site restrictions and by us on the back of the travel restrictions really pushed a
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:42.260]   lot of high margin revenue out of the quarter and probably out of the first half.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:52.060]   That was on top of some cost pressures of our own making, which we need to improve upon.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:25:01.500]   But I think in power, I believe that the team is doing a very nice job working off the so
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:06.620]   called inheritance taxes, driving real cost improvements, you see that in the head count
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:12.140]   reductions here in the first quarter, and as we get to a more normalized service environment
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:17.500]   I think you'll continue to see that turnaround continue to take flight.
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:24.460]   I think of renewables, Julian, it's a different dynamic, yes we had phenomenal revenue growth
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:31.140]   in the quarter double the onshore turbine deliveries here in the U.S., got a little bit of a better
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:38.020]   price, got about a point of price, which is encouraging to see, but it is by nature a
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:43.380]   very low gross margin business, so the growth isn't high calorie unfortunately.
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:50.100]   We had a few, well we figure one offs, but they're not one offs until they go away permanently
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:53.460]   costs and execution issues.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:59.740]   All the while the turnarounds in Hydro and Grid are I think moving forward, but it's early
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:07.060]   days and they have a number of inheritance taxes that will take a few years to work through.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:12.460]   So I think the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate those turnarounds
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:19.460]   in power and renewables, they're dealing with different dynamics in the respective businesses
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:24.340]   and that's really why I think I have the confidence to say that you should expect the decremental
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:33.020]   margins sequentially to improve the restructuring and the cost actions should present themselves
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:40.060]   and improve decrementals in the back half, but we've got work to do to make that happen.
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:44.660]   Great, thank you.
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:47.220]   From Wolf Research we have Nigel Kohi, please go ahead.
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:48.220]   Thanks Julian.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:55.300]   Thanks, good morning everyone and Karina, great to see you on board, so look, we appreciate
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:27:03.100]   all the color in the slides and the additional color in the queue, so Larry is it now a base
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:07.980]   case that industrial free cash flow will be negative and maybe just address the risk of
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:14.740]   significant cash burn this year, or is there enough on the cost outs and the working capital
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:22.940]   side to maybe mitigate some of that pressure and keep industrial free cash relatively steady?
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:32.500]   I think what we're trying to share this morning Nigel is that probably three things, one we've
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:41.460]   been hit hard and fast here, right, in some of our most important, highest margin businesses,
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:50.180]   be it aviation and services particularly, gas power services, PDX in healthcare.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:56.140]   We think that that gets worse before it gets better, particularly here in the second quarter
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:28:05.220]   with a full effect, it's uncertain as to how things play out from here, we're going to
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:12.340]   acknowledge that uncertainty hence the pulling of the guide, but we're not going to sit back
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:16.580]   and hope that it all passes, we're not going to take the view that we've got a sharp V-Bounce
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:22.860]   coming, hence the two billion of cost actions we've talked about and the three billion of
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:23.860]   cash actions.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:30.780]   We're going to do everything we possibly can to control our destiny here without impairing
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:36.900]   the long-term value and the long-term trajectory of our company, so we're telling you what
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:44.140]   we know today, we wish we knew more, but that is really the state of play right now and the
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:46.540]   approach, the headset that we're taking to it.
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:51.100]   Okay, I appreciate that Larry, thanks, and then I thought one of the real highlights of
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:56.860]   the quarter was the underlying strengths of the healthcare margins, even ex-biopharma,
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.620]   especially given some of the headwinds you face in there.
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:03.300]   We're seeing strengths in small equipment and pressure and big-ine.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.540]   How does that mix look though?
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:10.820]   When you look at the mix on smaller patient monitoring equipment et cetera versus the big-ine,
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:17.900]   how does that equipment mix play out to the margins?
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:28.940]   Well, we certainly, I think the key thing to keep in mind, Nigel, is the big iron certainly
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:41.060]   got hit, the lower ticket, the lower price point, the patient monitors, ventilators and
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:50.100]   the like certainly got quite a boost, but it's a small part of the business.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:53.500]   So there was a little bit of mix there, but not a lot.
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:30:00.100]   It was really more a function, frankly, of the team doing a nice job more broadly recognizing
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:09.220]   that absent biopharma, we needed to tend to the core cost structure in all its form in
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:10.980]   the HCS business.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:14.980]   We've been growing healthcare, biopharma leading the way.
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:18.740]   We got some good margin support from that business the last several years.
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:25.140]   Well, now as we think about the $17 billion core, the teams really, I think, put their
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:31.100]   sights the last couple of quarters on growing that business, growing it with a creative margin,
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:35.260]   and it's really the cumulative effect that I think you see a bit here in the first quarter
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.780]   before we got hit.
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:42.660]   We got hit a little bit later, not as much, you'll see more of that unfortunately here
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:47.540]   in the second quarter, but I think you've got a team who thinks that like many other medtech
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:56.300]   companies, they can load a mid single digits over time and put more digital into the mix.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:31:02.140]   Better cost, that should give us the opportunity to grow with a creative margin along the lines
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:06.540]   of what Kieran laid out in December, and I have no less conviction about their ability
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.380]   to do that today than we did when we made that presentation.
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:15.540]   Again, mindful that we've got some gyrations here in the near term to deal with.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:16.540]   Right.
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:17.540]   Okay.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:18.540]   Thanks Larry.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:19.540]   Good luck.
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.540]   Thanks Nigel.
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:21.540]   Thanks Nigel.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:27.060]   We are at the bottom of the hour, so Brandon, we're at the bottom of the hour, so we could
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:28.860]   just take one more question.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:29.860]   Sure.
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:33.620]   From RBC Capital Markets, we have Dean Dre, please go ahead.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:34.620]   Thank you.
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:40.820]   Good morning everyone, wishing everyone good health, and add my welcome to Carolina.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:41.820]   Thank you.
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:43.940]   Good morning Dean.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:44.940]   Good morning.
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:52.300]   Just two questions, both aviation, a lot of discussion about structural cost out, and Larry
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:32:01.100]   be interested in how have you balanced the structural cost out in aviation with rifts and balancing
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:09.060]   the rifts and furloughs versus how you might be compromising the ability to bounce back when
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:10.820]   it does ramp back up?
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:12.460]   So that's the first question.
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:17.180]   And then the second one, just to make sure I heard it correctly, did you quantify the leap
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:19.580]   cancellations in the quarter?
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.380]   I know there's delivery deferrals.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:28.220]   Our experience in 2008 was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations because
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:31.260]   customers would lose that nonrefundable deposit.
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:34.260]   So what's the expectation here in terms of engine cancellations?
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.740]   That's it for me.
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:38.740]   Thank you.
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:51.860]   Dean, maybe I'll take the first part of that, and perhaps Carolina can take the second.
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:58.100]   I think we are mindful, ever mindful, that there will be a recovery.
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:01.740]   And we want to be well positioned for it because it's going to be a very good business for GE
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:06.340]   for four decades.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:16.300]   But I think we are really trying to, again, embrace our reality and take the cost actions
[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:23.180]   in the aftermarket business, and more broadly at aviation, mindful that we've got a period
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:30.380]   of time here of an unknown duration, but it's not going to be measured in months where that
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:33.340]   business is going to be under considerable pressure.
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:41.420]   So after a period of time is the aftermarket has grown as it has the last decade, this is
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:46.900]   going to give us an opportunity to rethink, to consolidate.
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:53.940]   All the while mindful of our obligations to customers, the nature of how the footprint
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:58.180]   has changed, the changes that are probably still coming.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:01.140]   So there are a number of variables.
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:05.220]   It's very much a work in progress as well, but I think we've got line of sight to build
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:14.340]   on some of the temporary action to take permanent action to make sure that we have a lean cost
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:21.860]   structure with adequate capacity to come out of the downturn here, well positioned to perform
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:24.020]   both for customers and for investors.
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:25.020]   Thank you.
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:30.380]   We'll now turn it back to Steve Whitaker for closing remarks.
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:37.620]   Do you want to answer the question on – yeah, second question.
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:38.620]   Go ahead, Caroline.
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:39.620]   Yes, I will.
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.620]   Yeah.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.620]   Go ahead, Caroline.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:42.620]   Yeah, you were right.
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:49.020]   So I actually mentioned that in my notes there that in our backlog, which was flat sequentially
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:56.140]   and up 22 percent versus per year, that did include roughly 200 loop 1B unit order translations
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:59.180]   in the quarter.
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:05.740]   I would say the progress refunds are very small so far, but on top of that, we also saw G-CAS,
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:06.740]   right?
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:11.500]   So we have G-CAS cancellation of 69 aircrafts in April, so that will be reflected in the
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:16.020]   second quarter revenues and backlog.
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:20.540]   Great.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:21.540]   Thanks everybody.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:26.780]   I know it's a long call and a busy day, so if you need more, just reach out to us, and
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:33.300]   best of luck.
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.300]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:35.300]   This concludes today's conference.
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.740]   Thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star 1 on your telephone.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   If you require any further assistance, please press star 0.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vic Kinney, Head of Investor Relations.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Thank you. Please go ahead.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I'm Vic Kinney, Ingersoll Rand Investor Relations Leader, and with me today are Vicente Randall, Chief Executive Officer, and Emily Weaver, Chief Financial Officer.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Our earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which will be referenced during the call,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   In addition, a replay of this morning's conference call will be available later today.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that certain of the statements on this call are forward-looking in nature
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   For more details on these risks, please refer to our annual report on Form 10(k) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   and our current report on Form 8(k) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2020,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   which are available on our website at www.irco.com.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Additional disclosure regarding forward-looking statements is included on slide 2 of the presentation.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   in our slide presentation and in our release, which are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I will also remind everyone that in both our earnings release and today's presentation,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   we have included both as-reported financials and supplemental financial information to assist with analysis and comparatives.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The as-reported financials only include the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment results from the closing date of the transaction on February 29, 2020,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and the supplemental financial information provides results as the transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2018 to provide a full quarter of comparable results.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Turning to slide 3, on today's call, we will provide an update on the top priorities of the company in the current operating environment,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as review our first quarter total company and segment highlights.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We will conclude today's call with the Q&A session.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   At this time, I will now turn it over to the Santé Renault, Chief Executive Officer.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Thanks, Rick, and good morning to everyone on the call.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I would like to kick off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by COVID-19,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and all the dedicated healthcare workers, providers, and volunteers who are on the front lines all over the world battling this pandemic.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll Rand employees around the world.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The pictures on slide 4 are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   who have adapted to the new realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Every day, I hear of new examples of our businesses providing mission-critical products to our customers,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   one thing I am sure about is that Ingersoll Rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and serving our customers at the center of everything we do,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Moving to slide 5, I would like to grant everyone on the critical priorities we're following during these challenging times.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   When we close the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   that within a matter of weeks we will be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruptions to our customers' supply chain
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   and the day-to-day operations of the company.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us plan, accelerate, and adapt our actions
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers, and the community.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   through these uncertain times.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And finally, continuing to execute on the strategy of the company, as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The strength of Ingersoll Rand team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge from this crisis
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   as a stronger and more unified company.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values, as well as our execution engine that we call IRX,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   are really at the heart of how we operate as a company, especially in these unprecedented times.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   During the integration process, we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   One that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   This purpose, when combined with the four key values that our teams leave on a daily basis, creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll Rand execution excellence process.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll Rand.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Turning to slide seven, I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis, since it has been swift and focused around two major components.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   First is the health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And second, business continuity, not only within operations, but across a larger supply chain.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Starting first with health and safety, we activated our COVID-19 tax force in February
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   and had a full coordinated company approach in early March, just weeks after the creation of the new company.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Our execution approach has served us very well, as we are able to quickly implement enhanced site safety protocols
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and a mandatory work-from-home policy for those employees who can work remotely.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And it is encouraging that our quick actions have been successful, as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   But it's more than just implementing safety protocols. It's also about supporting and engaging the employee base.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   As a result, we have implemented a number of measures, including a global outreach program to facilitate employee feedback.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset, provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Not only did our team volunteers take individual pay cuts, furloughs and forgo vacation time this year,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   they have thoughtful in-depth suggestions, many of which were actively implementing today.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   From a business continuity perspective, starting first with our operations, as we previously communicated,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   we have seen plans largely in China, Italy and India impacted due to COVID-19.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   China was largely impacted in the month of January and February, and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   as things are now largely back to normal.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Italy and India saw about a two month lag to China, with operations being impacted in late March and into April.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And in this time, our sites around the globe are 98% operational,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The supply chain has seen a similar trend, as the impact in China is largely behind us
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   The Americas and India regions are stabilizing, as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   In the past few weeks, we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   which is a very good sign, and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Much like our operations, India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of May, when governmental restrictions begin to ease.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   We are addressing the current environment head on, by actively managing those areas within our control.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Let me tell you about what we're doing here.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Starting with slide eight, through the use of IRX, we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over $350 million,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   with increases across all major savings categories, and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   As a reminder, we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost energies
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   of approximately $250 million by the end of year three after closing.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energies
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   and the associated stand-up of the new company.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters, the facing of synergy delivery
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions, and that is exactly what we have done.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   We have dramatically increased the pace, having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   with approximately $70 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   The majority of these savings are coming from headcount actions, already taking in the past two months,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   In addition, we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative, with RFQs for nearly one third
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   of our historical direct materials fan base already launched, as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   In total, we're now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of 10 to 15% realization.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   We're keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million, over a three-year time frame,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   at this time to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   and I2B given the current environment. It is not only the structural cost that we have taken out,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short-term cost reductions
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   to protect margins. So let's move to slide nine to talk about that.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   In Q1, despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a proper basis,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   we were able to limit adjusted EBITDA incrementals to less than 30%,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   We expect that these additional actions will yield $40 to $50 million of incremental cost savings in the P&L this year,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   We will continue to re-evaluate on a monthly basis, and if the man environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   While we're making some tough decisions to control costs, one area that we are not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Much like we did back in 2015 at Georgia Denver, when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   and new product opportunities, we're following the same playbook today.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as demand generation and our IoT platforms.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   This is all part of the strategy to play often, now especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Moving to slide 10, let me talk about liquidity.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   At the time of the merger, we took the opportunity to reprise our legacy debt while placing the new $1.9 billion dollar term loan to close its transaction.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   All of our debt is a term loan B structure, with very attractive pricing as the U.S. components are LIBOR+175,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   and the Euro component is a EuroBOR+200.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   The term loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective, and there are no maturities until 2027.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   The liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion as we finish the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and over $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   As we look ahead, we continue to see several opportunities to undo cash as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Opportunities exist across working capital and cash taxes,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense in the second half of the year
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by September of 2020.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper, we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   given the attractive rate and covenant environment.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Turning to slide 11, our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   as we're building the culture of Ingersoll-Rand with our employees at the core.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   and at the same time, we will position the company for future growth both organically
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   and through opportunistic targeted bolt-on M&A.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Our business operates in the very fragmented markets, and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And importantly, our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   is taking shape as we launch several of our ESG-oriented initiatives already.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Overall, we have several value creation levers as we look ahead,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain macroeconomic landscape.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   I will now turn it over to Emily to work you through the financials. Emily?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Thanks Vicente. On slide 12, you will see the as reported financials for the company.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   As a reminder, the reported financials include three months of Legacy Gardener Denver
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and one month of the Legacy Ingersoll-Rand industrial segment in Q1 2020,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and only the Legacy Gardener Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   As a result, the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Other than to mention that the as reported net income in the quarter
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   includes $197 million of amortization, acquisition, restructuring, and other adjustments,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Turning to slide 13, to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   as of January 1, 2018. From a total company perspective,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   FX suggested revenue and orders declined 14% and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Regionally, we saw notable declines in Asia Pacific as well as sharp declines
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   in the U.S. and Europe towards the end of the quarter, most notably in the ITNS segment.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   This led book to bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   The company delivered 208 million of adjusted EBITDA as a decline of 24%
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   driven mostly by the volume declines in ITNS and the expected downturn in the HPS segment.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4% down 200 basis points from last year.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   However, our proactive cost controls within the business limited decrementals to 29%.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company, the legacy Gardner Denver business
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   delivered 97 million as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately 100 million,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   The legacy IR businesses delivered 51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March as opposed to a combined 60 million for January and February.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Moving to slide 14, free cash flow for the quarter was $60 million on an as reported basis including $8 million of CapEx.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   The Q1 free cash flow includes $63 million of outflows related to the transaction
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   comprised of 38 million of synergy delivery and standup related costs and another 25 million of transaction fees.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   We also paid $38 million of debt issuance costs in the quarter, which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   bringing our total transaction related outflows in the quarter to $100 million.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.6 times and while we do expect to see some short term increase to leverage,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   we have shown the ability to delever historically.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   As you can see on the right side of the page, we'll remain extremely disciplined on cash
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Specifically, internal reinvestments for growth, prudent debt pay down, and opportunistic bulls on M&A.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   We have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segment. Vicente?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Thanks Emily. Starting first with industrial technologies and services on slide 15,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   the IT&S segment first quarter adjusted order intake was $889 million, down 9% versus per year excluding effects.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Adjusted revenues in the quarter were $796 million, down 17% excluding effects,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and leading to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.12 times.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   From a regional perspective, Asia-Pacific revenues were down in the mid-30s,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   with Europe down 15%, and Americans down 7%, all excluding effects.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   We use this trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   meaning that the APAC decline in Q1 is what we expect to see in America's enemy in the near term.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   but we're staying highly active with the man generation activities and pricing controls,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   but we continue to demonstrate disciplining price, generating over 1% in the quarter.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   While these markets are more opaque than historically,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   we're using our unique data acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   in serving our customers in the current environment.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We break this out into two areas, aftermarket and original equipment.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   For aftermarket, a leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   As we can see, the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   that are connected to our remote monitoring systems.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   In America and Europe, we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   over the last few weeks of March of nearly 30%,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   with some recovery in the past few weeks of April.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   We're now using this as a way to know where our service teams need to focus,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   which is approximately 50% of the compressor business today.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   For original equipment, we're using the man generation leads.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   We said in the past that the man gen was a leading indicator of orders
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   With more than a thousand leads per week, we have a lot of commercial insight in our system.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   What we saw in the later weeks of March was a drop of 30%,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   versus what we saw earlier in the quarter, with similar trends in America and Europe.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   but still approximately 20% to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers, and vacuums,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   where we saw orders down in the mid to high single digits.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   We have spoken about third party industry reports in the past,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   According to a leading third party report, the market in the U.S. was down mid-single digits in dollars in the first quarter.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Garnet Denver branded products were flat, and Ingersoll brand branded product was down high single digits.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   But when you look into the details, you see the power of the two companies.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   As Garnet Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   while Ingersoll brand took share on high horsepower compressors.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   as well as the direct and indirect channels that both companies have.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Power tools and lift, which is part of the segment, had a very tough quarter,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   but the numbers and revenue down both over 20%.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   that online retailers typically make in the first quarter to support first half of the year revenue.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   However, this quarter, in addition to the slowdown of the market,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   many online retailers switch their focus to household essentials.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Moving to non-GAF at Yostaribita,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   IT&S delivered 135 million dollars in the quarter, which was down 25%.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Non-GAF at Yostaribita margin was 17%,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   which was down 150 business points from the prior year.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Other cost mitigation efforts helped limit the incremental to 25%,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   in a segment that typically has basic fundamentals of 35% to 40% before cost actions.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Moving to slide 16, to the precision and science technology segment.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Overall, the segment had solid performance in this economic environment,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   as adjusted orders were 218 million up 2% XFX.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Adjusted revenue was 192 million down 9% XFX.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   On strong prior year comes up 12% XFX growth and shipment delays due to COVID-19.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   In the first quarter, we saw orders growth high single digits
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   in the legacy medical pump business, as we are leading key players
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   in several applications like oxygen concentrators, respirators, and liquid handling.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into at the bottom of the page.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Our teams have been working 24/7,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down 2% XFX,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   with a majority due to COVID lockdowns in January and February in China,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and towards the end of the quarter in India.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in the more industrial end markets.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   PNST delivered 53 million down in the quarter, which is down 6%.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%, up 120 basis points,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   driven by strong cost controls and productivity, leading to incremental margins of only 15%.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Moving to slide 17 and the specialty vehicle technology segment,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   the priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   We see that this segment can expand margins with the use of the same IRX tools we have used across other segments.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And expect to see improvements of this business moving forward.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Adjusted orders were $230 million, and adjusted revenue was $185 million,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   up 8% and 7% respectively, with a boost to bail of 1.15.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Growth was driven by the strength in golf, connectivity, and consumer products.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   The business saw strong double-digit order momentum in early January and February,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   but as the pandemic hit the U.S., we saw sharp decline in the second half of March.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   What there is a lot to be excited about, we're expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple reasons.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   First, last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   where some product was shifted to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And two, the business is not immune to this current environment.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   While April orders were down year-over-year, we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   We feel this is driven by a couple factors.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   First, in the consumer product line, the team people took quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   widely used in the legacy industrial businesses.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   And we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And second, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, specialty vehicles deliver $18 million in the quarter, down 1%.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was 9.9%, which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth, investments, and public mix.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Moving to slide 18 and the high-pressure solution segment, the business performed above our expectations
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   in a tough operating environment, with adjusted orders of $84 million and adjusted revenues of $96 million.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Down 26% and 29% respectively.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   As expected, the revenue base in the business was nearly 90% aftermarket, and the team executed very well commercially,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   with sequential adjusted orders up 6%, and sequential adjusted revenues up 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   We continue to see shared gain opportunities in aftermarket, and specifically consumables where we saw orders
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   and revenue up double-digit sequentially.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $24 million on margins of 24.6%,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   which was down from last year level of 30.8%, but sequentially better by over 400 basis points.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   As we pivot to the second quarter and rest of the year, a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   We can measure that in multiple ways, but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   As a reminder, each fracked fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   With each truck carrying one pump, each pump has a fluid end, and every fluid end utilizes consumables.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   While Q1 and 2020, on average, we saw 318 active fleets, the exit rate in March was 240.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter where we believe 50 active fleets,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   due to the recent dynamics in the market with the oversupply and lower pricing for oil,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   have full impact on revenues within this segment.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Because of that, we're taking very proactive stands to drive proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Moving to slide 19, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of all.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Overall, the total company is down approximately 20% in orders, as the month began very slow, particularly in U.S. and European markets.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   By the order momentum throughout April, we expect total revenue to be low in terms of orders,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   both industrial technology and services, and specialty vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   While precision and science technology is performing considerably better, with positive year over year orders performance thus far,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   as a result of continuous strength in medical pumps.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And not surprisingly, the high-priced solution segment is down approximately 20%.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   As the market resets, for what will likely be a prolonged downturn, that we expect will last for a number of quarters.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   As we look forward, due to the uncertain environment that we find ourselves in, we will not be providing Q2, or total year,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   to best manage our business and ensure we're taking the right steps to manage multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   and the associated impact on cash flows.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Our current model shows that the business will need an annual basis to be cash flow break-even using fairly conservative assumptions
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   around working capital and capital, coupled with the cost of actions we have taken thus far.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   We feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compared to current order trends and coupled with our current liquidity position.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Furnace is like 20 for some concluding remarks.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I want to say that what we manage through what we will know that will be a tough second quarter.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   We feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has not changed.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Inges O'Ran is a premier industrial company of our transformation.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   We have multiple levers for accelerating value creation, but being very focused on the current part of our liquidity.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   With opportunities to increase these by unlocking cash, as well as taking advantage of the current rate environment,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   we will continue to drive a culture of execution, and we continue to pay attention to the opportunity.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Particularly on the current condition is to be strategic on bolt-on acquisition.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   For this, we will turn to Q&A.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Number one on your telephone keypad.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   If you would like to remove yourself from the queue, you may press the pound button.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Enter yourself to one question, and your first question comes from Andy Kapilitz from Citigroup.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Your line is open.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Good morning, guys. How are you?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Good morning, Andy. Good to you.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Vicente, can you give us more color into the April order decline?
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   You're seeing your largest segment in ITNS.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   First of all, how long do you think the change in customer behavior from that power tool business
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   is a smaller option than exposure in ITNS?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So are there discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   given that they're more project versus the industrial compressor business?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Yeah, Andy, let me just give you a little bit of color.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   As you saw, we said roughly April total order is down 20 percent,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   both to build greater than one.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   From a both to build perspective, the industrial technology
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and the precision and science were greater than one, and obviously leading the way.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   In terms of ITNS, in particular, I will categorize it as the short cycle was most impacted in the quarter
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   and continue to see some relatively weakness here moving forward.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   It's mostly correlated to, I guess, maybe the PMI.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   From the down and the mainstream, which is what we consider to be more on the long cycle,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I'll say comparatively a bit more stable in the first quarter,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and we continue to see maybe some of that in the month of April.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Again, typically we tend to get the orders for that long cycle now in the first half of the year
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   in order to get shipments in the second half.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And from a PTO, from a power to perspective, yeah, I mean, rough quarter in Q1.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   As I alluded, I mean, last year, there were seeing some fairly good growth momentum
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   from their expansion into online retailers.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And you saw that in the first quarter, many of these online retailers,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   they moved to having other kind of more household goods or critical needs to fight COVID-19.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   And clearly, this business saw some of the impact.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I'll say April sale is relatively slow.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   So we haven't seen the people with the momentum of the power to business.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   So that's helpful Vicente.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And I'm sure you expect us to ask about decremental margin in some way.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   So let me just ask you like this.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Obviously, good result in Q1, of course, the 30.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   How do I think about decrementals with high pressure solutions?
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   It orders down 80%.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Can you hold decrementals there in the mid-40s?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   At what point does fixed cost become a problem?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   I know you talked about accelerated.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   The rest of the business, can the rest of the business hold 30% decrementals
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall in the rest of the business?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Yeah, so I'll say Andy, I mean, that's kind of what we're targeting for.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And I mean, as you have seen, we have performed well in the down cycles in the past.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   I think we have a good solid playbook that we executed in the 1516
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   that included both not only in the industrial downturn, but also an upstream downturn.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Base decrementals, they tend to be around 40% across the business
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   with slightly higher in businesses like the high pressure, as you mentioned,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   as well as the precision and science, because of the nice high growth margins
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   that those businesses have, and lower on the specialty vehicles.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And the industrial technologies, they tend to play in that kind of 40% range.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   You've seen that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and the short term actions to protect the margin.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   We saw, as you mentioned, some very good first quarter results
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   for the total business under 30%.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   And Q2 will clearly see a bit more pressure from a top line perspective,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   but we will continue to manage the decrementals with the target being closer to that 30% of the EBITDA.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And when you think about the actions, we're clearly taking much more aggressive actions
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   and high pressure around cost actions based on what we see here with a lot of our data points
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Very helpful to send this. Stay well.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Your line is open.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Hi. Good morning.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Good morning, Julian.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Morning. Maybe just a first question on that point on decremental margins.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   So if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the year
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and also about 40 to 50 million of other cost out actions,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   and should those mean that decremental margins narrow or not necessarily
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   depending on your mix and some other things?
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   He maybe break it down into the two buckets as you suggested.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   The 40 to 50 that we spoke about that are kind of more related to discretionary or kind of volume related,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   those are largely second quarter and a third quarter with a good majority,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   I would say more so on the second quarter from the cost synergy perspective.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Million dollars out of the 80 to 90 million dollars of in-year rough account
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   and I would say that is kind of consistent third quarter and fourth quarter
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   while the other roughly 10 to 20 million dollars that comes from procurement
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   it is really more weighted towards that kind of Q3 and Q4.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Then maybe just my second question for you all for Emily around the free cash flow.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   You had a good performance in Q1.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Just wondered you had assumptions around breakeven free cash but assuming play out,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   what kind of sales are down, call it 20, 25% for the year?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   What type of free cash flow conversion should we expect?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   How do you see the working capital moving?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   You had I think in the free cash that $63 million of transaction and separation cash cost in Q1.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   What's the rough assumption for the year?
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Yes, we're very pleased with the Q1 cash performance as you saw there Julian.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   We've been managing cash to put in good processes and strong controls around it given the current prices.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   We expect cash to still be moved forward but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move through.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   We're really managing payments as the collections we're receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   What the future holds, a lot of that's going to depend on time for sure,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   but we know we'll maintain our cash position and our liquidity.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   How about the costs?
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Any very rough guide post for the year in light of that $63 million in Q1?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   It will be some incremental cash.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   I don't have the figure at my fingertips at the moment, Julian, but I can get back to you on that.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Your next question comes from Michael Hollerang from Baird.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   More than everyone. Hope everyone's doing well.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Could we just talk about the synergy funnel you referenced?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   What are some of the incremental sources that you originally identified $250 million?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Maybe talk about the difference you're seeing, the longer term some of the revenue synergy opportunities you're seeing.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   As you recall, we always said that we were going for, as we were 60 days into the transaction,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   we have all these visibility as to what that funnel could potentially be.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Roughly $100 million comes from a combination of structural savings and rationalization,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   kind of non-manufacturing, alluded to on the investor's side.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   We have now a pretty good database of all the locations across the world,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and that is giving us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Not so much demand coming year two, year three,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   but more the other kind of perspective.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   So second part of the question, liquidity is in a strong position.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Some of the one off things is operation and some of the extra things I'm only just referenced.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   What would it take you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the cash-off flow?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And then second day earlier today to do that, that we're going into some sort of recession here.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Who knows how long the opportunity is going to accelerate you to play capital more toward the M&A side of things
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   over the next couple of years, and are you positioned for that today?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   What kind of thoughts and how you're thinking similarly about that capital side over the next six, nine plus months?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Yeah, no, absolutely, Mike.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   I think clearly over the next couple of years continue to be a really hard part of our strategy.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   We see it's a very unique environment right now.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   We still see at this point in time some very good funnel also very good funnel around industrial technologies,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   but there are really more relatable buttons.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Your next question comes from Nigel Koh from Wolf Research.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Your line is open.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Good morning. How are you guys?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Good to you.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Yeah, good thanks.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   We'll take performance.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   So a little bit of performance, and it seems like most of that came from the legacy IR businesses.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Can you maybe just kind of spell out in a bit more detail how much of that can be explained by the jobs of the industrial, of the IR?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Also, what happens with service during the quarter?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Nigel, what happened to what?
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Yeah, what happened to?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   I would say this.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   I think China was definitely impacted largely in January and February.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   The legacy IR business, they have a pretty sizable China exposure.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   In terms of the service, we saw service better.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Typically, we saw roughly about two times from a percentage perspective, better performance than the original equipment.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   And just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here, particularly the ways of comparing some of the...
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   You know, industrial technology is composed of multiple technologies, compressors, backing, and blowers.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   And our compressor business is clearly within the...
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   When we specifically compare to some of the competitors, there's a couple of data points that we look at, so the third party report.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   At the same time, you know, just to give you a further perspective, the legacy Gardner Denver business in Q1,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   the orders were down in the low single, so in the market.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   And, you know, since we didn't own the legacy IR for the full quarter,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   we just tend to not comment on what we saw specifically, you know,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   in February that they saw from an order perspective.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   But that hopefully gives you a good perspective as to how you form even on the legacy GD.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Great. Thanks.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   It doesn't become so small now that there's so much involvement.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   But if it is down 8% in the quarter, that implies, you know...
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   I mean, is it possible to break...
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   Given that you're clearly expecting this business to be kind of like weaker for longer,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   would you expect revenue to kind of like just bounce along the trough here for the next several quarters?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   I mean, any kind of that would be helpful.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Yeah, and, you know, so for sure, you know, that's what we're targeting to be, you know, the break-even and even positive.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   I mean, we're taking some pretty aggressive actions, 100% after market and consumable.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   So that kind of carries a much better margin profile too as well.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And, you know, those factories that are kind of not needed based on volume,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   I mean, we're basically keeping them close or very, very low exposure.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   So yeah, a good playbook on how to not be...
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Have gone extensive work.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   And, you know, I think we see that we can definitely overcome these kind of long-term requirements.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Our plan is that it's going to be down for a while.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And to the second question, you know, I mean, clearly it's a market that, as you saw,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   we just invested in new fluid and technology so, you know, we can be ready for capturing.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Great. Thank you very much.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Our next question comes from Jeff Sprott from Vertical Research Partners.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Good morning, Jeff.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   So why don't we just come back to service for a moment to send a interesting comment about the utilization down from 30%.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   But how do we actually interpret and apply that to a forward market?
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Sales are going to be down 30% of the service, as I don't believe.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   I don't know if you have enough data historically to kind of piece that together,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   but what does that down 30% tell you?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Yeah, Jeff, great question.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   So in terms of the historical data, we don't have a lot of historical because, as you can imagine,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   a lot of these remote monitoring systems and connectivity with IoT platforms that we both companies have now is fairly new.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   But we have enough data to then break it down by the specific end market.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   The indication here is that it's telling us where are those markets that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   So it's helping us to redirect the teams.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   It is also helping us to really better serve our customers and making sure that we're still more resilient from that perspective.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   You know, in terms of being down 30%, I mean, I think we just see that as a bit of indication as to what could happen here.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   But as you gave us a great correlation, we don't have a lot of historical data to --
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   so what we're doing is just taking that data point to keep focusing them on those areas, regions, and markets
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   that we're still seeing some very good utilization of the compressors.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   And any answers?
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   You noted IPS obviously includes more than compressors back.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Are you suggesting that those other products areas outside of vaccines and blowers were substantial?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Yeah, so for sure, yes.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   I mean, for sure, the Power Tools and the Listing Business was one that was worse than that.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   I mean, the Power Tools is -- they have two main programs.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   That tool business, but also they have a lifting business that is kind of more related to factory consumption or factory rationalization.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   So I think, you know, that was impacted more so.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   And then China as a region was definitely heavily impacted.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And, you know, from the other product lines in terms of the longer cycle, which these are kind of brands like Nash,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Garo, Liquor Green Ponds, and Liquor Green Vacuums, those are more longer cycle and those were, I'll say, more stable and resilient.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Great, thank you.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Your next question comes from David Rosso from Evercore ISI.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Your line is open.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Good morning.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   My question is about, in the ITF's inventory in the channel, and you think about some of the recent improvement you've seen,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   can you give us some sense on any sequential improvement, sort of a lead lag,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   and also the mix of your businesses being short cycle versus long cycle?
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Can you just give us some sense of the inventory in those channels, the lag you would need to see, or that you would experience if, say, the PMIs got better, for example?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Yeah, David, I mean, I think, you know, when we look at the inventory in those channels, I mean, there's just not quite this from a compressor perspective,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   which is obviously the one that has the biggest size of the distribution network, and it is also more particularly towards the Garner Denver branded products.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   You know, we don't tend to have a lot of inventory because these are particularly smaller distributors, more sub-regionalized, more localized.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   They don't tend to put a lot of cash up front to have compressors on the shelf, so to speak.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   I mean, maybe on the smaller compressors, they may, but not on the medium to high level compressors.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   And the inventory will come in more on consumables after market, and really move fairly well.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   I mean, they turn fairly quickly.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   You've seen, just home clear, is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in ITS?
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   Or have you seen some, you know, little improvement in order sequentially?
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   And I'd be curious, is that more short cycle or long cycle?
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Yeah, no, yeah, great question.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   It is out categorized as the stabilization initially, and then obviously when you look at it within the month, I mean, at the month of April,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   you know, there's some slight improvement on the second half of every program.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   But again, was that more short cycle improvement?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Short cycle, yeah.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Short cycle.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Short cycle.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   All right.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Appreciate it.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Sure.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Your next question comes from Josh Polkalinski from IsOpen.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Hi.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Good morning, all.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Morning, Josh.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   So this afternoon, I guess, you know, everyone here on the call kind of had the same list of questions.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   So we covered a lot of ground already.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   But I guess, you know, just with some of the commentary around utilization and with the comments you made around supply chain and eruption,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   how much of the decline you're seeing, and I guess this comment is mostly an IT and S comment, is related to, you know, customer shutdowns or supply chain and eruption in some form,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   like, you know, the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Because I think to some of these points on, you know, service or utilization that maybe that's not the steady state, you know, state of the world there.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   Yeah, Josh, I'll say more so in China.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   If you want to think about it, kind of that disruption completely.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Also in the first quarter, maybe some disruption from the perspective of in Europe, particularly in Italy.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   I mean, we do have some very good manufacturing base in Italy.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   And we, although we stayed operationally, I mean, most of our suppliers had to shut down.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   I would say that now, as kind of the comment that I made before, we see kind of days lower demand level kind of getting more stabilized.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   But, you know, still, you know, not seeing that kind of recovery.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   And we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will play out.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Okay, and then switching over to the synergy funnel. I mean, it sounds like the year three pipeline of activity, you know, kind of has to stay there as you have to act on other things first since we're manufacturing centric.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Fair to say that the incremental step up in synergies then in the year two is smaller.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   I guess, you know, is this more of a pull forward from year two or are you kind of implicitly saying, hey, we think there's more than 250 here.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   We're just, you know, we're working on this as fast as we can and we'll update you as we know more.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Yeah, I think that's exactly the case.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   We think we want to keep it at 250 just because we think it's prudent.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   And we think it's prudent because we're, I mean, clearly focused on a lot of the internal funnel and execution.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   You see how we accelerate it and we execute it. I mean, this is not just talking about the execute it.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   There's a component around procurement and an I2V savings innovative value that is volume dependent.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   And when we did the $250 million cost synergy funnel, it was done based on 2019 kind of runway level, so to speak, on spend levels.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   So we just want to be prudent from kind of going out there and saying that the 250 will increase.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   You know, once we're ready, we'll definitely, and when we see kind of more stability or normalization in the markets, maybe we come back with that.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   But at this point in time, we're accelerating what we can control.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   And we know that we can control that structural headcount out and that's exactly what we executed.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   We know we can control a lot of the quickings in procurement because commodities are lower and we are executing that.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   And we know we can control a lot of discretionary spend and that's exactly what we also executed.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   So we're very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Great. Appreciate the call.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Steeple.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Your line is open.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   Good morning, thanks.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   See, you know, revenue down 8.6 to XFX, margins up 120 basis points.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   So clearly some very good control lag on what drove the very good decrementals there.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   How you see the decrementals going forward and maybe any color you can give us on what you think the long-term margin opportunity is in that business.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Nathan, this is, you know, I'll say some very good cost control but also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical business.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   If you remember last year when we talked about the medical business, we were seeing upwards of 200 basis points margin improvement
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   and the medical business finishing last year at roughly, you know, 30, 31 percent EBITDA margin.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   So again, very good momentum from that business and clearly as we saw some suffering in the market,
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   the team continued to execute those targets that they needed to get done.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   You know, I think when you look at this business that, I mean, has some very nice gross margins
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   and, you know, the decrementals, the basic decrementals are typically, you know, 45 or so.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   I mean, pretty good job that the team did here in order to get the decrementals down to the 15 percent.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   And I'll say, you know, from a long-term perspective, we'll definitely come back with giving some kind of medium to long-term perspective.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   I'll just do a quick comparison and you can see that medical, we were able to, you know, not only, you know, just a few years ago,
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   that medical business was in the 25, 26 percent EBITDA margin and we finished, you know, last year in the 31 percent EBITDA margin.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   And there's just a lot of good commonalities between the medical and the legacy, you know, PFS and ARO business that are within this segment.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Okay, maybe just one on receivables.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   When you look through that, do you see any customer credit risk, any collection risk there?
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   I guess it's particularly an upstream comment given the way that market's going.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   But anywhere else you see any potential issues in receivables, how you're going about managing customer credit, those kinds of things?
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   I mean, I'll say no necessarily, Nathan.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   I mean, I think it's one that we live by day by day.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   I mean, clearly on the high-precious solution, which is, as you mentioned, the most exposed, I mean, customers are still paying.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   They take longer to pay, but they still pay.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   You know, they also realize that, you know, from an upstream perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   So we have been pretty strict in many cases that we need to see the payments or we will stop shipment and then we cease to provide any type of output of products either now or later in the future.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   So I think we're really executing a good label here on collections with the teams.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   Excellent.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Thank you.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   Thank you.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Your next question comes from Nicole DeBles from Deutsche Bank.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   Your line is open.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   Yeah, thanks.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   Good morning, guys.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   Good morning, Nicole.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   So a lot of this has been answered.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   We've covered a lot of ground so far, but I just wanted to ask one.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Into next year, as we think about, you know, approaching our recovery, there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   We've got, you know, more structural cost savings coming through, presumably.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   You have temporary costs probably coming back to the business.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   And then just kind of dovetailing all of that with typical incremental margins.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   I'm not sure, you know, how best you can do this the same day, but it would be really, you know, helpful to kind of characterize the way you see incrementals coming out, you know, on the other side of this downturn.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Yeah, I know, Nicole.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   I mean, I think, you know, we typically see kind of the base, what I call the base level of incremental to be, you know, for the total business between 35% to 40%.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Again, you know, when you look at precision and science, maybe higher than that, specialty vehicles lower than that with maybe industrial technologies about that level.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   You know, definitely, we'll see a little bit of a headwind as we see a lot of these structural activities that we're doing to come to the provision.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   We also see a lot of, you know, tailwinds.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   I'm sorry, we see tailwinds as a lot of these kind of structural costs come out.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   We see some of the headwinds, but, you know, as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we kind of work with the teams,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   we'll definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin, obviously, to be at a minimum of that, days or more.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Okay.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   Your line is open.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   Your next question is from Marcus Nitmeyer from UBS.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Your line is open.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   Hi, good morning, everybody.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   One more on this.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Hi, good morning.
[00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   On synergies, I do appreciate that, obviously, procurement is volume dependent, but you flag here 10 to 20 million savings realized in 2020.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   What do you currently assume are sort of full run rate savings out of that weight one of the spend, which I think is a third of your overall spend?
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   And how should we think about more medium term for the other two thirds?
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   If you assume that a company in a normalized world gets back to about 2019 levels, let's start here.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   Yeah, I think if you think about it, 10 to 20, you know, coming in this year, as you go into 2021, assuming maybe kind of current volume levels,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   it'll be 20 to 40 million.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   So that's maybe at least that what you can see here coming from weight one on an analyzed level at current volumes.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   And that always is only covering, you know, a portion of the total spend with weights two and weight three coming up here in the second half of the year.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   Right.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   Is there sort of an estimate you can give us what that would have been at 19 volume levels, that sort of, you know, 20 to 40?
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   I mean, it would definitely be a much, a little bit higher than that.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   I mean, I wouldn't, you know, I think at this point in time, you could say, you know, 40 to 50 could be upwards of 16.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Okay. And then the second question on capital allocation, you flagged in the slides with what's interesting, those bolt-ons in PST.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   It's obviously pretty fragmented market.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   You probably have a share of, call it 15 percent in that space.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   How do you think about this?
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   How does that segment look like in a few years?
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   I mean, it's, you know, from an aftermarket perspective, I know it's a design win and replacement business.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   So the aftermarket dollars per se or share is relatively small compared to your company average.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   But how do you think about this sort of, it just struck me that it was flagged specifically in the slides?
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   Yeah. I mean, I think this is a segment we like a lot by the way that these businesses are kind of so niche and very solid market positions.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   And it has just a lot of great descriptors such as, you know, kind of high gross margins and very specialized pumps that are kind of really solidly mission critical in the processes where they apply.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   You know, we continue to see that there's a lot of potential, not only in organic, but also organically.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   And we're doing a lot of work on that, whether you take technologies like the ARO and combine that with the, like a, either a Haskell branded product or a Milton Roy product.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   And then you can actually create some uniqueness in terms of applications and then enter some new markets.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   And that's what a lot of the team are doing.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   And it's, you know, how do we are being thoughtful and mindful on some of those vertical markets and kind of new niche adjacent areas that we want to play in.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   And not only do that organically, but then see what other technologies from a Bolton perspective we can acquire.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   So a lot of really great work strategically going on in this segment to really picture these and how do we kind of double it.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Thanks a lot. Good luck.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   Hi, good morning. Sorry about that. I had some technical difficulties earlier. I'm glad to hear everyone's doing well.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   You know, maybe just one question here. You alluded on the call to share gains on kind of both the legacy GDI and IR businesses.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   I wanted to know if you could put a little more color around what's driving those. Is it something on the product side?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   Is it, you know, some of the end market strategies you were doing previously around, you know, more niche markets like paper and pulp?
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Maybe some competitive pressures from smaller guys? Just any kind of color you could provide there would be helpful.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   Sure, John. And I categorize it, what I said on the call is that it is on specific horsepower and what we saw that we liked is that this is in the U.S. based on the third party report.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   And we liked it because it was very complementary. So if you look at the legacy Garner Denver, we saw some share takes in the low to medium horsepower while we saw on the Ingersoll run some share take on the high kind of larger horsepower compressors.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   I will categorize that as, you know, Ingersoll run has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the larger horsepower.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   Well, as you know, you know, from a Garner Denver perspective, we have been more focused on the medium to small compressor.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   And I think, you know, this is what I mentioned on the call that this is a great hypothesis that we had on this great merge and combining the two companies.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   Because now we have great new complementary products and spectrum of technologies that, you know, a lot of these that I mentioned is on the oil lubricated, which is very good solid kind of core product line.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   But as we spoke about during the April call, now also the oil free product line spectrum.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   So again, it's new technology, new products, and be able to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the products of the teams at luncheon.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   Great. Appreciate taking the question.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   Thank you, John.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the company.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   Thank you. I just want to close out by saying thanks to everyone for your interest in Ingersoll run.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   I just want to do another shootout and thank you to our employees that are always doing a lot of work here to stay health, stay safe to safety.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   And at the same time, you know, provide to our customers the mission critical pros that are needed in this kind of current market condition.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   So hopefully everyone stays safe and healthy and we'll look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks. Thank you.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Constellion's second quarter
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.020]   2020 results call.
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.600]   At this time, all participants are in a least and only mode.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.200]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   time.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.480]   If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.320]   touchstone telephone.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.920]   As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.640]   I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Ryan Bentley, Director
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640]   of Investor Relations.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.760]   Sir, please go ahead.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.760]   Thank you, Operator.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.960]   I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2020 earnings call.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.600]   On the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Jean-Marc Germain, and our Chief Financial Officer,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   Peter Mett.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.080]   After the presentation, we will have a Q&A session.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.880]   A copy of the slide presentation for today's call is available on our website at constellion.com
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.640]   and today's call is being recorded.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.680]   Before we begin, I would like to encourage everyone to visit the company's website and take a look
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080]   at our recent filings.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.800]   Today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Security
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.760]   Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such statements include statements regarding the company's

[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   known and unknown risks and uncertainties.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.080]   Under a summary of specific risk factors that could cause results differ materially from those
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.680]   expressed in the forward-looking statement, please refer to the factors presented under
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.440]   the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual report on Form 20F.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.120]   All information in this presentation is as of the date of the presentation.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.280]   We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.080]   of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.000]   In addition, today's presentation includes information regarding certain non-gap financial
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.160]   measures.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.800]   Please see the reconciliations of non-gap financial measures attached in today's slide presentation
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.640]   would supplement our IFRS disclosures.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.600]   I would now like to hand the call over to Jean-Marc.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   Thanks Ryan.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.240]   Good morning, good afternoon everyone, and thank you for your interest in Constellium.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.880]   Let's turn to slide 5.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.920]   At Constellium, the health and safety of our employees is our first priority.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.000]   We have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.120]   We have provided our personnel with personal protective equipment, increased cleaning and
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.760]   sanitation, allowed for and enforced social distancing, and worked to raise awareness
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   with our employees.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.280]   I want to personally thank our employees for taking this seriously and following the precautions
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.480]   we have put into place.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.280]   As of last Friday, approximately one-half of one percent of our employees have tested positive
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.240]   for COVID-19, and all of whom have recovered or are recovering.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.920]   Needless to say, we must remain vigilant.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.360]   During the second quarter, our plans operated well, despite the significant disruptions to
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.160]   customer demand from lockdowns in both Europe and the US.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.880]   As I'm speaking, all our plans are running now and well.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.960]   We are carefully monitoring COVID-19 hotspots, both for the health of our employees and any
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.600]   potential impacts on supply chains.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.640]   The demand for our products gradually increased during the course of the second quarter, and
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.520]   this trend has continued into July.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.040]   However, both levels of demand and visibility from our customers remain below historical
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.360]   level.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.640]   We took strong actions to combat the effects of the pandemic on our business.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.600]   We aggressively reduced our costs, including flexing variable costs to match production
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   levels, reducing fixed costs, and lowering our targeted capital expenditures.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.840]   Over 40 percent of our workforce were on subtype of partial unemployment, or temporary
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.040]   lay of scheme, during the quarter.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.880]   Where appropriate, we have also implemented permanent headcount reduction.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.960]   Our ability to flex costs was slightly better than the scenario we provided last quarter.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.840]   This was a great achievement by the entire constadium team and demonstrated our flexibility
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.960]   and resilience.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.520]   Our liquidity at the end of the quarter was 949 million euros, an increase of over 300
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.800]   million euros, compared to the end of the first quarter.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.080]   We added an additional 50 million euros of liquidity in July through credit facilities supported
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.320]   by the German state, bringing our pro forma liquidity to approximately 1 billion euros.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.880]   In June, we accessed the debt markets to refinance our 2021 bonds.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.320]   This transaction removed our only near term bond maturity at a very attractive coupon.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.280]   In conclusion, with the significant actions we have taken, I am very confident in our
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.760]   ability to navigate through this crisis.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.400]   On slide 6, you will see some of our highlights from the second quarter of 2020.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.920]   Shipments were 310,000 metric tons, a decrease of 25 percent compared to the second quarter
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.480]   of 2019.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.720]   Revenue decreased 33 percent to 1 billion euros.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   Of the roughly 500 million euro decline in revenue compared to the second quarter of last
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.800]   year, two-thirds was related to lower shipments and one-third was related to lower metal prices.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.320]   I remind you that while our revenues are affected by changes in metal prices, we operate a pass-through
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.640]   business model to minimize metal risk.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.680]   Net loss of 32 million euros compared to net income of 17 million euros in the second quarter
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.160]   of 2019.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.520]   Adjusted EBITDA of 81 million euros decreased 51 percent compared to the second quarter
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   of 2019.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.160]   With a strong focus on cost control, we are able to offset a significant part of the volume
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.720]   of EDWIN to adjust EBITDA across each of our business units.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.920]   I am proud of what the team was able to achieve in a challenging environment.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.000]   Costadium generated 228 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first half, a decline of 24 percent
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.240]   compared to the first six months of last year.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.840]   Our free cash flow was negative 33 million euros in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.520]   This result would not have been possible without our strong actions to reduce costs and capital
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.000]   expenditures and cash expenditures of all sorts.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.680]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was 54 million euros.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.600]   Based on our current view of market conditions, we expect to generate positive free cash flow
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   in 2020.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.280]   I will now hand over to Peter to discuss our financial performance in more detail.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   Peter?
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.480]   Thank you Jean-Marc and thank you everyone for joining the call today.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.680]   Turning now to slide 8, you will find the change in adjusted EBITDA by segment for the second
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   quarter in the first half of 2020 compared to the same periods of last year.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.840]   For the second quarter of 2020, Costadium achieved 81 million euros of adjusted EBITDA,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.680]   a decrease of 86 million euros or 51 percent year over year.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:55.240]   Our adjusted EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased by 21 million euros or 27 percent compared
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.720]   to last year.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:05.280]   A&T adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased by 33 million euros or 51 percent compared
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:15.240]   AS&I adjusted EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31 million euros compared
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   to last year.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.920]   Currently, holdings and corporate costs of 7 million euros were 1 million euros higher
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.120]   than last year.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:32.820]   In the first 6 months of 2020, Costadium achieved 228 million euros of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.920]   of 74 million euros or 24 percent year over year.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:45.080]   Part of adjusted EBITDA of 124 million euros decreased by 14 million euros or 11 percent
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.440]   compared to last year.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:56.400]   A&T adjusted EBITDA of 83 million euros decreased by 33 million euros or 28 percent compared
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.920]   to the first 6 months of 2019.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:08.360]   AS&I adjusted EBITDA of 33 million euros decreased by 26 million euros or 44 percent compared to
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.080]   last year.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.760]   Lastly, holdings and corporate costs of 12 million euros were 1 million euros higher
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.300]   than last year.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:23.600]   We expect agency costs of approximately 20 million euros in 2020.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.720]   Now turn to slide 9 and let's focus on the PARP segment.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:35.320]   Adjusted EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased 27 percent compared to the second quarter
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   of last year.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.920]   Volume was a headwind of 41 million euros in the quarter.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.400]   Packaging shipments fell by 12 percent primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in March
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.320]   of our Nuffer-Zach plant in France due to COVID-19.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:59.600]   Shipments to the North American canned sheet market increased slightly year over year.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.400]   Automotive shipments declined 54 percent compared to last year as many of our automotive OEM
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.800]   customers curtailed production for April and most of May.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.080]   Price and mix was a headwind of 2 million euros.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:23.120]   Costs were a tailwind of 21 million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with labor
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.320]   and maintenance as important contributors.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.840]   Metal costs were neutral in the quarter as we faced difficult year over year comps, UBC
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.280]   supply chain challenges and lower metal prices.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.640]   Next translation was a tailwind of 1 million euros.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.680]   Now turn to slide 10 and let's focus on the ANT segment.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:53.400]   Adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased by 51 percent compared to last year.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:11:01.760]   Volume was a headwind of 46 million euros on lower aerospace and TID shipments.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.920]   Aerospace shipments fell 37 percent compared to last year as aerospace OEM and distributors
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.360]   began to reduce orders.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:18.200]   TID shipments declined by 20 percent due to lower industrial activity in both Europe and
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.400]   the U.S.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.880]   Price and mix was a 3 million euro headwind due to lower aerospace shipments.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:33.960]   Costs were a tailwind of 15 million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.840]   labor, metal and maintenance as important contributors.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:46.200]   Lastly, FX translation was a 1 million euro tailwind in the quarter.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.080]   Now turn to slide 11 and let's focus on the AS&I segment.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.840]   EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31 million euros compared to the second
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.080]   quarter of 2019.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.040]   Volume was a 31 million euro headwind.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.920]   Automotive shipments declined 52 percent compared to last year due to customer shutdowns for a
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.160]   significant portion of the quarter.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.600]   Industry shipments declined 16 percent due to lower industrial activity in Europe.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.960]   Price and mix was a 9 million euro headwind partially due to price and mix as a consequence
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.080]   of weaker market conditions.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:37.480]   Costs were a 9 million euro tailwind on strong cost control with labor, energy and fixed costs
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.280]   as important contributors.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:45.800]   Lastly, FX translation was a 1 million euro headwind in the quarter.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:51.680]   Now turning to slide 12, I want to highlight our very strong cost performance during the
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.320]   second quarter.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.480]   In the second quarter we managed to flex our cost by 83 percent.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.960]   Cost flex represents the change of cost over the change of revenues for the second quarter
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.120]   of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:16.400]   Effectively, for every dollar change in revenue, we were able to flex our cost by 83 cents.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:23.120]   This compares favorably to the 75 percent variable cost estimate we provided last quarter.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:28.280]   At the bottom of the page, you can see that each of our businesses demonstrated strong
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:37.320]   cost control with PARP at 92 percent cost flex and ANT and AS&I at 75 percent.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:44.280]   To put this in context, excluding metal and depreciation, we reduced cost by approximately
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.760]   100 million euros compared to the second quarter of last year.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:56.400]   These cost savings were driven by strong cost control across the businesses including labor,
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.120]   maintenance, professional fees, subcontractors and energy.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:08.320]   I will note that our second quarter 2020 figures include approximately a 15 million euro benefit
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:14.440]   from European state employment aid related to COVID-19.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.520]   I want to congratulate the team for the aggressive actions taken on cost.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   We will continue to maintain our strong focus on cost control, particularly given the uncertain
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.080]   demand environment.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.080]   Now let's turn to slide 13 and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:40.760]   At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was 4.4 times and our net debt was 2.2 billion
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.480]   euros, slightly lower than our net debt position at the end of 2019.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.960]   We remain very committed to capital discipline.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:58.320]   We reduced our 2020 CAPEX target to approximately 175 million euros, a 96 million Euro reduction
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   from 2019.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.720]   Through the first half of 2020, we spent 32 million euros less in CAPEX than in the same
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.240]   period of last year.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.840]   Our free cash flow for the second quarter was negative 33 million euros.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.320]   During the quarter, as a consequence of lower activity, our factored receivables were lower
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.200]   than the levels that we have maintained in recent quarters and negatively impacted our
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.320]   free cash flow by 73 million euros.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.160]   We would expect the reverse to occur as activity levels increase.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.320]   Excluding the impact of factoring, the company actually generated positive free cash flow
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.880]   in the second quarter, which is a very impressive outcome in my view.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.360]   Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was 54 million euros.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:58.240]   As Jean-Marc noted earlier, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 based on our
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.240]   current view of market conditions.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.800]   Generating free cash flow is a firm priority and we remain committed to deleveraging.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.840]   As you can see in our death summary on the bottom left hand side of the page, we have no
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.800]   bond maturities until 2024.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:21.880]   During the quarter, we refinanced the remaining 200 million of our four and five eighths percent
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:33.360]   notes due 2021 with $325 million of five and five eighths percent notes due 2028.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.680]   While we initially planned to repay the 21s with free cash flow, we felt it was prudent
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.760]   to remove this near-term maturity given the favorable debt market conditions.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:52.000]   Notably, this was the lowest coupon dollar bond that Constellium has ever priced, a considerable
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.840]   achievement in the midst of a pandemic.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.640]   As a result of our financing activities thus far in 2020, we now expect cash interest of
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.600]   150 to 160 million euros.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:12.280]   Our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was 949 million euros at the end
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.840]   of the second quarter.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:20.240]   As Jean-Marc noted, we added 50 million euros to this balance in July and we remain very
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.760]   comfortable in our liquidity position.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.320]   I will now hand the call back to Jean-Marc.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   Thank you Peter.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.800]   Let's turn to site 15.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.840]   I want to highlight something that is core to our business, sustainability.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:40.040]   In early July, we published our 2019 Business and Sustainability Report which you can find
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   on our website.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   I'd like to point out a few highlights from 2019.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.120]   Safety is our first priority.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:54.280]   Our target is to reduce our recordable case rates by 10% year after year.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:02.400]   In 2016 and 2019, our recordable case rate decreased by 27% and we are trending very well
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   this year.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:09.720]   This means that more of our colleagues are returning home injury free every day.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:17.200]   We also improved our energy efficiency by 6.4% compared to a 2015 baseline.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.240]   That is the equivalent of 100,000 metric tons of CO2 savings every year.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:32.320]   Further, we introduced a 2025 target to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 25% against
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:40.200]   the 2015 baseline and we have a detailed plan to achieve this target.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.720]   As many of you know, recycling is a core competency at Constellium.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:52.240]   Aluminum is infinitely recyclable, with 75% of all aluminum ever produced still in use
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.640]   today.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:59.160]   Muscle Shoals is one of the largest recyclers of aluminum cans globally, with the capacity
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.040]   to recycle over 20 billion cans every year.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:10.520]   At Novprezac, we also recycle the equivalent of 12 billion beverage cans every year.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:18.560]   As a company, Constellium recycled over 560,000 metric tons of externally sourced aluminum
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.800]   scrap in 2019.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.160]   I am also proud that third parties are recognizing Constellium for our sustainability achievements.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:34.920]   The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, or ASI, is an industry led initiative to drive sustainability
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.000]   across the entire aluminum value chain from producers to customers.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.160]   In 2019, we received ASI certifications for Zingen's casting and rolling operations and
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.960]   we began producing ASI certified coils for our customers from Zingen in 2020.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:01.840]   We also received ASI certification of our Novprezac facility under provisional COVID conditions
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.000]   in 2020.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.080]   We achieved the Ecovattis Platinum rating, which is awarded to the top 1% of companies
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:19.480]   assessed worldwide, and we received an ESG rating of AA from MSCI, placing us in the top
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   5% of our sector.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:27.840]   Overall, we had a very successful year on our sustainability objectives in 2019 and I look
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:34.320]   forward to continuing our progress on these very important initiatives.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.840]   Now let's turn to slide 16 and discuss our end markets.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.960]   To believe our balanced portfolio of products across end markets, geographies and customers
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.120]   is a competitive advantage during challenging times like these.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.400]   I'll start with the packaging market.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.640]   Packaging is a core market for Constellium and we presented 38% of our LTM revenue.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:05.080]   We continue to see strong demand in North America and stable demand in Europe.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:11.880]   Another evidence that this market is both recession resilient and secular growth.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.800]   We believe the packaging market has long-term secular growth tailwinds driven by customer
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.400]   preference for aluminum cans.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.480]   Our customers continue to invest in new can lines with several additional investments in
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.160]   North America just announced in the last week.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:35.560]   These additional lines should drive incremental demand for canned sheet in the years to come.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:41.400]   The consumer preference trend is only one of tailwinds for canned sheet.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.800]   In Europe, the demand for canned sheet continues to grow based on substitution of aluminum
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   for steel.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:54.520]   In the US, we continue to expect the growth of auto body sheet demand to tighten supply
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:00.500]   to the packaging market over the medium to long term.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.960]   Now let's move to automotive.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.240]   Over the long term automotive remains a secular growth market for aluminum.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.760]   Customers continue to prefer larger vehicles.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.440]   With regulations aimed at increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions, the automotive
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.960]   market will need to continue to lightweight.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.640]   In addition, we expect hybrid and electric vehicles to continue to gain share of the fleet.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.680]   These vehicles are aluminum intensive due to the importance of lightweighting to achieve
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.160]   their range objectives.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.840]   Constellium is well positioned to realize the benefits of this secular shift to aluminum
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.120]   in automotive and the electrification of the fleet.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:49.560]   Moving to more recent trends, automotive OEMs began curtailing production in March and largely
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   resumed production in May.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:59.160]   While demand from our customers increased significantly in June, we have experienced uneven demand
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:06.040]   for our products as a result of supply chain challenges and COVID-19 hotspots.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:11.560]   While we are optimistic about automotive demand in the back half of 2020, the demand for our
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.200]   products will be dependent on the level of production at the OEM.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.080]   Let's turn now to aerospace.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.680]   Aerospace represented 15% of our LTM revenues.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:30.440]   The near-term outlook for aerospace remains uncertain due to the effects from COVID-19
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.360]   and the 737 MAX.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.640]   Aerospace OEMs have reduced build rates and it is unclear how long build rates will remain
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.440]   at these levels.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.760]   We expect aerospace shipments in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 will be lower than
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.800]   the level in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:56.760]   In TID, we expect to continue to expand in each product in a diversified range of markets
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.440]   over the long term.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:05.000]   In the near-term, the defense and rail markets remain strong, but most industrial and transportation
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.400]   markets remain weak.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.200]   These markets are dependent upon the health of the industrial economy in Europe and North
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   America.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.920]   It is unclear when and to what extent these markets will rebound.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:24.920]   In closing, I again want to thank the Constellium team for their tireless efforts during this
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.920]   trying time.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:32.200]   We remain committed to operational execution, harvesting the benefits of our investments,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.760]   discipline capital deployment, debt reduction, and shareholder value creation.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:43.920]   With that, Joanna, we will now open the Q&A session.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.920]   Thank you, sir.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press far than the number
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.800]   one on your touchtone telephone.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.840]   If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:04.320]   the pound key.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.680]   Your first question comes from the line of Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.600]   Your line is open.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:28.280]   Chris, if you are on mute, please unmute.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.320]   Chris, your line is open.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.720]   Hi, John Mark and Peter, can you hear me?
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   Yes, we can.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.840]   Good morning, Chris.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.840]   Good morning.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.680]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:48.440]   The first thing I wanted to start with was just the utilisation rates and the comments
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.440]   from 1Q.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:56.160]   You sort of stepped through how you saw utilisation in each of the divisions for 2Q and then perhaps
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.440]   for 3Q and 4Q.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.280]   I appreciate you don't have guidance, but I wondered whether you could maybe concessually
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:09.480]   talk through 3Q versus 4Q and just versus 2Q or any comments you could make on the divisions
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.560]   as an update from last quarter.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   Thanks.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   Sure, Chris.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.680]   So I'll start to the markets and then kind of translate it into what it can mean for the
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.360]   divisions, right, for the business unit.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.680]   So when you look at our second quarter of this year versus the second quarter of last year,
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   you see packaging roughly 10% down.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.920]   You see automotive 50% down.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.360]   You see aerospace 40% down, right, roughly.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.040]   And the other markets and each market is about 25% down.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.840]   This is made of very different dynamics, right?
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:50.840]   So in packaging, what we are seeing now is 95% utilisation.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.840]   There was a bit of a drop, especially in April, with all the lockdowns in Europe, reduction
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.680]   in canned consumption and all that, but that has come back pretty strong and the U.S. continues
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.440]   to be quite strong.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.840]   So we look at packaging, again, recession resilience, secular growth, and we're pretty confident
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:16.560]   for the second half of the year and we look at Q2 as being kind of an abnormal quarter
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.040]   because of all that happened in April and a little bit in May.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.480]   If I look at automotive, it has really snapped back.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.640]   I mean, I think when we talked on Q1, we're talking of 20% utilisation as we were speaking
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.480]   and now we're at above 80%, right?
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.280]   And if you do the average of 20 and 80, you get to 50, which is about what we experienced
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.200]   in the second half in terms of reduction in their shipments.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:51.720]   It seems like it can be stronger than 80% going forward.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.380]   We still are running very well in July, but we've seen that this restart has been with
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.800]   all kinds of fits and stops, right?
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:05.280]   So you've got hotspots, you've got supply chain disruptions, you've got difficulties in bringing
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.960]   products from Mexico, building trucks in Texas is challenging.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.400]   So you've got all those operational issues that all of us in the supply chain have to
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.280]   deal with.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:24.000]   But clearly the demand seems to be well in excess of 80% of where we were last year.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.900]   So that's encouraging and hopefully COVID-19 doesn't throw too much of a wrench in that
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.900]   good trend.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:38.640]   If I look now at aerospace, where we were running at around 60% in the quarter, we expect
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.600]   more pain in the second half of the year.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.200]   And I think the reason for that is it's a long supply chain.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:54.600]   And the customers move a little bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their orders.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:01.240]   And that is creating a bit of a lag in terms of how much pain we take.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:06.280]   We are in very detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.200]   to look at what the second half ought to look like.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.480]   And whilst contractually we could force some volumes on us, that's not our type, what
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.760]   they don't need, we don't want to force on them.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   So what we're working through is taking more pain now in the second half so that 2021 we
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.520]   start with a clean slate.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:32.240]   So we would expect some reduction in operating rates in aerospace in the second half of the
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   year.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:39.360]   And so if you translate all that into what it means for the different BU's, I would expect
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.760]   BOP, packaging and automotive, to be better.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:50.680]   I would expect AS&I, automotive structures essentially, to be better in the second half.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.920]   And I would expect the NT to be more challenged in the second half.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.920]   Thanks.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.040]   Thanks so much.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.040]   Sorry.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:10.080]   Just sort of follow up on packaging specifically where the volumes were down around about 10%
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.240]   I think year on year.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.200]   And you're saying Muscle Shoals is doing well, it seems like the US is going well.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.520]   I think Crown yesterday mentioned that Southern Europe was weak.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.840]   Can you just comment a little bit further about packaging in the EU region?
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.360]   Is it down in the quarter because of demand or because you had facilities offline and maybe
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.560]   you could quantify some of the EU impacts?
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:41.720]   Yeah, I think so the reason I'm saying more than 90% or 95% whatever, not 100% is exactly
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.320]   because of some weakness in Europe, right?
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:52.520]   And I think it's got to do with both the reduction in activity in Southern Europe, I mean a lot
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:58.760]   of these countries have economies that are based on tourism and this is not the best year
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.760]   for tourism as we all know.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:07.560]   And we are seeing there's little clusters and hotspots so everybody's vigilant as it should
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.560]   be, right?
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:16.240]   So that is weighing down a little bit on canned consumption in Europe, yes.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:29.120]   Okay, and just, sorry, I want to follow up on working capital specifically, I just wanted
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:35.160]   maybe Peter, if you could talk through the two cue moving parts, obviously you've stepped
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:40.080]   through those waterfall charts and you're getting cost out doing a great job on the cost side.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:46.200]   I just wanted if you comment a little bit further on the second half of the year and what the
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:52.720]   opportunities are on working capital in terms of you saying positive for the full year, you've
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.680]   already obviously hit the positive number at the halfway point, so just wanted if you
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.880]   could talk through the moving parts on working capital.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:06.320]   Sure, happy to do it, and just for context, so on the second quarter as we said last quarter
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:12.440]   we would use working capital and we in fact burned 63 million of working capital in the
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:21.960]   Q2 and for the first half were positive 24 so based on where we sit today I think it's
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:28.280]   plausible to think that with auto ramping, with packaging kind of continuing to ramp
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:35.580]   back up that we could lose some ground in the back half of the year so not a huge negative
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:41.720]   but we could see working capital being a use in the back half of the year but Chris I would
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:52.800]   say that we remain confident in spite of that, that we can achieve a free cash flow position.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:59.400]   Thanks Veda, that's it for me, thank you.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.760]   Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the benchmark company, your line
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.760]   is open.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   Good morning.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.760]   Morning Josh.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:16.160]   Just a question, how are you thinking any tariffs on Canadian aluminum, have you increased
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.000]   any inventory expecting that or just what should we be thinking on that front if that
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.640]   comes to fruition?
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:30.600]   Yeah, well we believe it's a misguided measure if it happens, we blob it against it in the
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:36.360]   past, we got it removed, it may come back, we think it's misguided and it doesn't address
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.320]   a problem which is overcapacity from China, from a non-market economy that doesn't play
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.280]   by the same rules as we do.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:50.480]   Now that said, if it happens it's got a very limited impact on us, I remind you that we
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:58.400]   pass through the melt cost essentially to most of our customers, there may be a little section
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.240]   of the business where we cannot reprice immediately when it happens but on the other side we may
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.640]   gain a little bit more on scrap recycling as well, so not much of an impact for us.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.040]   The reason we're against it is much more a matter of principle because we believe in free and
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:22.160]   failed trade than really a problem for our finances or our economic outcome.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.040]   Got it.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:31.440]   And then just on the canned sheet front, can you remind us of when your larger contracts
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.840]   are up for renegotiation and then just comment around pricing strength?
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:44.640]   So we don't go into the detail of exactly which contracts mature when, but you know that we've
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:53.240]   got a few renewals coming around the 22 horizon, we are making good progress and I think the
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:35:00.600]   pricing environment is, I would describe it as a mildly positive in the US and mildly negative
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:07.400]   in Europe because of the specific situation now, I remind you that contractual negotiations
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:13.200]   take a lot of time here and whilst we, you know I say it's mildly positive here and mildly
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:20.680]   negative there between now and whenever we actually ink a contract, things may change but I think
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:29.200]   it's a pretty benign environment and our product is in demand, I'll brag a little bit, our quality
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:36.000]   and our service is very much recognized, most of all that's done a terrific job over the past
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.480]   five years and is a very strong player in the market now, very recognized, quality service-wise
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.080]   and therefore has always been.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:50.840]   So we have strong positions and I'm looking at the future with a great deal of confidence.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   Great.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.840]   Thank you.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.840]   Thanks Josh.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   Thanks Josh.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:02.680]   Your next question comes from the line of David DiGliano from BMO Capital Markets.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   Your line is open.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.680]   Great.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   Thanks for taking my questions.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.360]   First of all, I did have one question on the numbers for the second quarter.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:15.720]   Did you say there was a $15 million one-time benefit included in the $81 million adjusted
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   EVA dial-in?
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:22.280]   You're talking about for the labor benefit?
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   I thought it was a COVID-19 state aid benefit, is that included in $81 million?
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.880]   Yeah, that's included in adjusted EVA dial-in.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.080]   But it's not a one-off and it continues.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   Those programs are what is referred to as a curbside bite or short-time work and these
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:45.320]   government programs continue through 2020 and in some cases in 2021.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   Okay.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.360]   So we should assume about a $15 million quarterly benefit from those programs each quarter?
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:56.840]   No, because what will happen, David, is remember, so in the second quarter we had a lot of people
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.160]   on the sidelines, right?
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.560]   But as we ramp up, then we're going to have substantially less of that.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:09.520]   So I think you should assume that in the businesses, so packaging, for example, where we had some
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:19.040]   benefit in Q2, we should have basically very limited, if any, benefit in Q3 and automotive
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.440]   which has fade away and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating innovation
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.240]   right there, but it'll be a much lower number.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.360]   To give you an indication, we mentioned about people being unemployed during the quarter.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:40.800]   At the trough, which is behind us, we had 6,000 people and there's some kind of an employment
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.520]   benefit or temporary layoff.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.200]   Now we're at less than 2,000.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.640]   So it's closed dramatically.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.800]   And David, just to put it in perspective, if you get to the fourth quarter, the number
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:01.760]   might be something like 25% of that, right, just based on the utilization rate.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.760]   Just rough number.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   Okay.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.160]   That's actually helpful.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   Thank you.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:13.640]   And then just in terms of the individual and market commentary, on the aerospace side,
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.880]   obviously that's the, or has been, you know, the highest margin business, and, you know,
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:26.760]   just in terms of the outlet commentary, you framed, obviously, two segments up, one segment
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.240]   down, but, you know, the down segment is, again, the highest margin segment.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.520]   I didn't really get a census to order magnitude of the down number versus the up numbers.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.920]   Can you just give us a census to, you know, do you believe that aerospace will completely
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:46.280]   offset the recovery and auto and packaging in the second half, or a bit more, you know,
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.760]   color on magnitude, order of magnitude on the decline in aerospace would be helpful?
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:56.280]   So it's very difficult to tell David, because we're, as we speak, in very active discussions
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.160]   with our customers.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.640]   And at the end of the day, it's so cool that we have to make jointly with them.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:08.160]   As I mentioned, we've got contracts whereby we can force them to take some product, which
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.640]   they will take and pay for all, but then they don't need it the following year, right?
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.880]   So they hold the, they hold the inventory, they are holding the back.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:20.200]   So we are looking collaboratively with them in terms of what is it exactly they need,
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.760]   which by the way, I don't think they fully know now, and it's no criticism of them.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.560]   I mean, it's very unusual time.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.960]   And once we know what they need, and we look at what cuts do we take, then I could answer
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.200]   your question possibly.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:43.080]   At this stage I cannot, I would just say that there will be for sure more pain in auto structures.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.640]   And then in auto structures, in aerospace, my apologies, aerospace.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:52.280]   Now the other thing, too, is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:40:00.280]   in the recent past, the second half is always weaker than the first half, right, in aerospace.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.200]   So that's something to factor in as well.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   Okay.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:12.320]   And just, my last related question is, I think you mentioned, I think average utilization
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:19.200]   rates for aerospace related demand in the second quarter was around 60% at your facilities.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   Is that right?
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.440]   What is that number now?
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:31.880]   We're running still around that number, but I would expect it to go down maybe to 50%
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.360]   that kind of range.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.360]   Okay.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.360]   All right, that's helpful.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   Thanks very much.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   Okay.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:45.920]   So it's important to say, we're not expecting it to go down to 30% right to you, not on
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   the horizon.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:57.000]   Speaker, your next question comes from the line of Kurt Woodward from Credit Suisse.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Your line is open.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Hi.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Good morning.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   Hey, Kurt.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Thanks, Kurt.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Peter, first question, on the 100 million euro of cost reductions, how much of that would
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.360]   you view as structural, and then, you know, I guess just in general in terms of the amount
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.160]   of cost, do you think you could take out of the business this year on a permanent basis?
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:23.360]   Can you give us an update on those efforts?
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:32.320]   Yeah, so if we look at the, I mean, so the biggest piece of that 100 million is related
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.560]   to labor, right?
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:40.560]   And that's probably, labor is probably half of that 100 million.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:48.680]   So what we're doing now is we are really closely looking at the business and what it's likely
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:54.640]   to be like for the next couple years, and then you're trying to size our labor forces according
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.200]   to that.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:02.520]   So in that regard, I think we would expect that there's going to be some kind of permanent
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:11.320]   savings, but remember, as we kind of ramp up the operations, we do expect some of that cost
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.860]   is going to come back, right?
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:20.720]   So you know, I'd say it's hard to give a really precise number on that, Kurt, it's a difficult
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.720]   one.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   Okay.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:31.560]   Kurt, if I may add, we have talked about Horizon 22, right, and one of the strategic initiatives
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:39.640]   was to look at how do we lean our organization without losing competencies, capabilities, but
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:44.060]   how do we lean and make the organization stronger?
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:48.960]   And I think what COVID-19 is doing to us, and I guess to many other companies out there,
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.280]   is accelerate the number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:01.160]   So along the lines that Peter was saying, I think we'll come out of this with some permanent
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.720]   cost reductions.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   And as we ramp up, we will not ramp up and inject back 100 million of cost.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:14.080]   How much will remain to be seen, because we're really learning as we're doing and we're just
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:19.680]   in the middle of it now, but we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:26.560]   And there's certain categories like, for example, professional fees, subcontractors, where kind
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.640]   of as we work without fees, because those are kind of big categories of reduction, I think
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.960]   we were able to kind of live without a lot of that going forward.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:42.520]   So yeah, I think there's definitely a piece of that that we can carry forward.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:48.440]   Just to give you an example, there are not trivial there, quite revealing, right?
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:54.680]   So we've got a very strong R&D and technical support organization, which is people that
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.320]   are centrally located and then go and help plans.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:04.640]   And historically, a lot of the work was done by people going to the location.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.400]   Now obviously, in the past three months, nobody's been able to travel anywhere.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:15.380]   And a lot of that has been done through remote interaction, video conference, but even when
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:22.360]   you go to a plant and you look at, I got a problem and I need to improve the speed on
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:30.880]   this mill, we've had people interacting by the mill pull bit on a face time and looking
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:39.000]   into the rolling mills by face time with a technical advisor on the other side of the
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   planet.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.920]   And that works actually fine, which we wouldn't have thought it would be possible.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:49.600]   So in the future, what you're gaining here is, well, you're saving travel time, which is
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:57.520]   not very good for the aerospace business, but also you're saying the cost, you're saving
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.240]   the time, which means that people can be on several interventions, whilst historically
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.720]   within a week, it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:14.440]   So I think we're going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our space that are
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.320]   going to be quite interesting in the future.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:23.920]   And I think it's going to help us inject more brain and talent remotely with more action.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:30.600]   And Kurt, as we go forward, we may be able to give you more color on this, but hopefully
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.160]   it comes across that we're really looking hard at taking structural costs out.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:41.360]   And in the short term, the objective is we want to be kind of free cash flow positive
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:47.520]   through this crisis so that we don't take on any incremental debt, ideally.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.120]   And in the longer term, we want to emerge with a kind of much stronger earnings power.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:58.800]   So we're focused on exactly that, and we'll have more to say as we progress.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   OK, now that's helpful.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:09.200]   And then in terms of the pre-cash flow dynamics, you mentioned I think a $73 million impact
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.640]   from backfiring this quarter.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:17.440]   Otherwise, you'd be pre-cash flow positive, which is pretty positive given your utilization
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   rate.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.680]   And now you're talking about 95% utilization and packaging over 80% and auto-- and it seems
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.720]   like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:35.400]   So 75% of your business could be close to 90% utilization in a couple of months.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.640]   I get that arrow is weaker.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.880]   But it would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint, you know, unless working
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:49.600]   capital would be a major negative, you should be generating decent free cash in the back
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   half of the year.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.640]   Can you comment at all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year?
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   Yeah, sure.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   Thanks for the question.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.800]   So we won't put a specific number on it, but we're confident that we will generate free
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.760]   cash flow for the full year.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:13.360]   And the back half of the year, I think there's a very good chance that we can generate some
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.600]   free cash flow, but it depends a lot on what happens with trade working capital.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.040]   As I said, we've got the ramp of these businesses.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:27.000]   So we want to be a little cautious until we see the pace of the ramp and the consequences
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.520]   of the ramp.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:33.360]   But again, for the full year, we remain confident that we can generate free cash flow.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:40.600]   Okay, and then just final question on arrow, John Mark, you had a comment on, I guess, working
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.720]   with the OEMs to create, you said a clean slate entering 2021.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:52.920]   So you know, is that statement kind of reflecting the fact that the OEMs cut very quickly, and
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.080]   I assume they're sort of an excess inventory issue that they're dealing with or in general
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.080]   on the supply chain?
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:04.560]   So hypothetically, your volumes would be below the actual bill to rate to help them clear
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   inventory.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:11.040]   So then when you get into 2021, the supply chain is in a pretty good position.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.480]   And contractually, you said you're not going to force it on them, but then if you're going
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:25.520]   to help them manage that, do you get anything in return, i.e., price benefit, or just everyone
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.520]   helping each other?
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:30.480]   Just a little bit of an understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate comment.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.800]   Well, yeah, no fair question.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:39.680]   So I think I've commented in the past on the fact that I thought that the shipments were
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:46.920]   making into the OEMs, right into the supply chain, were actually higher than what the build
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.960]   rates were warranting at the time.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.640]   And obviously the build rates are going down very significantly down now.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:49:04.120]   So the pain we're going to take in the second half I think is not going to cure all the inventory
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.720]   buildup in the supply chain, first of all.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:15.680]   But I think what that does is it positions us for 2021 that doesn't show further deterioration.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.360]   That's what we're into, right?
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:23.000]   And we want to be in a place where what we supply is by and large consistent with what is being
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.200]   built, right?
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:28.800]   So that's what we're trying to do, whether we get there fully, I don't know, but certainly
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:39.880]   we are aiming to be better in 2021 than what the nine months of post-COVID will be in ANP.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.800]   That's one of the goals.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:50.640]   In terms of what we're getting from the OEMs, we've got very strong deep strategic relationships
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:56.960]   with them, I've commented also in the past on the fact that we're in it for the long haul.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.720]   And I think it's evidenced by the 10-year contract we signed with Airbus.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.440]   I mean, 10-year is a long duration, never happened before.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:12.840]   And we did it because it was the right thing to do for both companies, for both businesses,
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.520]   and we didn't do it as a reaction to COVID or whatever, right?
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:22.680]   And that was really the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.440]   So we're looking past the current crisis.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:30.800]   The current crisis, we've got to get all in the same boat or in the same aircraft and put
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.120]   us in the same place, work together to overcome the crisis.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.680]   And we are not talking about, you know, if I do that, you give me a bit more price or whatever.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:46.040]   I think it's just a relationship where we want to be in the win-win partnership and we do
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.480]   some things that help them and they'll do some things that help us in the future, which
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:57.360]   I've already done in the past and that's already happened and that's continuing.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   Okay, great.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.880]   Thank you very much.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:06.040]   Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields from Bank of America.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   Your line is open.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:14.000]   Hey Peter, one on the markets and then one on the balance sheet please.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:22.400]   So, you know, saw that CAN volumes were down about 11 percent, but, you know, Norsk reported
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.160]   CAN volumes up 11 percent.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.520]   I think you guys face relatively the same markets in Europe.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.600]   Can you sort of point to why maybe they're having more success on their CAN volumes?
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:39.040]   Is it enough per sock being down issue or a market issue or like what, can you just explain
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.840]   that discrepancy for us please?
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   Sure.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:48.440]   It's mainly, I believe, I mean, I cannot comment on their specific situation, but in our case,
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:53.280]   the main reason was that we had to take down NAFRIZAK for a full week and then ramp it up
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.280]   gradually.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:52:01.480]   I remind you that NAFRIZAK was at the center of a hotspot of the first real hotspot in France
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:08.240]   and that was a very terrible condition for the second half of March.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:14.560]   So in March we continued to ship out of Finnish goods, but then we had to replenish the Finnish
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:22.320]   goods and that really took down our shipments in the second quarter, but we're back to normal
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.320]   now.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   Okay.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.320]   Thanks.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   That's sort of what I expected.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:32.680]   And on the balance sheet, it looks like you got a decent amount of funding from France and
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:36.240]   obviously Switzerland and Germany.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.160]   You said it was partially guaranteed, but it's also secured.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:46.240]   Can you just give us a better understanding of sort of what it's secured by, is it inventory
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:52.080]   or is it sort of PPE and then to what extent is it guaranteed by the French government?
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:59.880]   Well, it depends on the facility, but the big one, the French one, is secured on PPE and
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:05.960]   E. And in the case of the German ones, one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.240]   and the Swiss one is unsecured.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:16.360]   And the guarantees, the way they work is they guarantee a certain percentage of the principal.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   So it's a normal syndicate of banks with, in the case of France, I think the guarantee
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:29.200]   is for 70 percent of the, or sorry, 80 percent of the, in the case of France of the principal
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.560]   balance is guaranteed by the French state.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.640]   In the case of Germany, I think it's 80 percent too.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:43.960]   So just for our purposes as credit analysts, 80 percent of that French loan is sort of non-recourse
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   to you?
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:52.320]   Well, again, it is recourse to us.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:57.240]   What I think, the point is, is that if you're a lender, so for example, if you're in the
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:04.480]   syndicate of banks and you are lending say 50 percent, your responsibility is for 10,
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:12.280]   oh sorry, 50 percent, 50 million, your responsibility is for 10 of that, right?
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:16.920]   So it's the banks that benefit from the guarantee, not the company.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:17.920]   Okay.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.360]   So you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks?
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.360]   Okay.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:27.120]   But one thing, yeah, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:32.400]   The government isn't backstopping the loan for you, it's backstopping the loan for the
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.400]   banks.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.400]   Exactly.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.400]   Exactly.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:43.560]   So another kind of, I think is a really important point, is our intent in putting this liquidity
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:51.360]   on the balance sheet was to remove any question about the fact that we have enough liquidity.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:56.160]   As we said from the beginning and based on the performance in the second quarter, we
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   do not anticipate using this.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:03.520]   So the French facility we had to draw just by the terms of the agreement, but it just sits
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.960]   on our balance sheet as cash.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:13.280]   And the German facility that we've now signed up in July, we don't expect to draw that.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:16.280]   The delay draw term loan, we haven't drawn that.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:23.160]   And the Swiss facility, we don't have that drawn in most instances.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.720]   And the way we benefit from the state guarantee is through a very cheap interest rate.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.720]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   Right?
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.720]   That's right.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.680]   And that was important to us.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.400]   We don't think we need the money, so we're not going to pay a lot of interest for it.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:43.400]   And it obviously was an inducement for the banks to lend.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   Right?
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:50.920]   Now fair enough, and I think the French facility is what, two and a half percent effectively
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   at this point?
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   That's the code.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   All right.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.320]   So you don't really have an incentive to pay that off quickly, given your bonds or
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.200]   kind of twice that, right?
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.200]   No, no.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   That's right.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:10.000]   Now remember, there are some limitations on the use of the capital, right?
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.080]   So for example, we can't use that capital to go and buy back bonds in the market.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:21.040]   So it's really meant to be for kind of operating needs of the company.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.040]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.560]   We don't have a strong incentive to repay that.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:32.280]   But what we will do is, you know, obviously, there's some cost to it, right?
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:37.240]   So as we kind of emerge from the crisis and have a little more visibility, then we'll
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.680]   unwind those facilities.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.680]   Okay.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.960]   That's very helpful.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.520]   Thanks for all the color, and good luck in the back ask.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.520]   Thank you.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.520]   Thank you.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:52.880]   Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wendrock from Deutsche Bank, your line
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:53.880]   is open.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.880]   Hey, guys.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:00.840]   Thanks for taking my questions, and a really great job on transparency and costs here.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.840]   Both very helpful.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.320]   Thanks, Sean.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:09.120]   Just when you think about big picture, if you look at the auto market, there's sort of projections
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:15.680]   out in the market that will have about, you know, 25% decline in new cars this year, mostly
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.280]   based on the fact that we weren't producing back in March/April.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:23.600]   And if you look at the used auto market, you know, it's been pretty strong as we've used
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:27.680]   prices, really, you know, rising even above last year.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:33.320]   You know, you talk about how production's been increasing and demand is increasing there.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:40.200]   You know, to kind of get to down 25%, you know, you'd have to have some pretty strong growth
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.400]   in 3Q and 3/4.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:48.760]   So I guess what I'm asking is, do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon,
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.480]   you know, with demand pulling through based on a lack of cars?
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.120]   And if you can provide a little color what you're seeing there, that'd be very helpful.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:04.360]   Yeah, so then the auto book is strong, there's no question, it's above the 80% that I'm mentioning,
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.360]   right?
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:13.400]   But we've been a little bit caught, you know, by customers just a few months ago telling us
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:17.720]   we need product tomorrow and then telling us the next day the plant is shut down, right?
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.320]   So, you know, we are very vigilant, right?
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:24.120]   So I hope, I think the end demand is there.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.040]   I think, and that's true in the U.S., that's true in Europe, right?
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:33.000]   The governments have injected a lot of money in the hands of consumers, right, through the
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:39.320]   unemployment benefits of, you know, different shapes and forms that you see on both continents.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:44.440]   And that is, you know, pretty good for end demand at the end of the day.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:50.520]   So I hope it's going to be, it's going to materialize into the older book we have is going to be
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:56.020]   actually real orders and shipments, in which case it should be better.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:59:04.280]   But you know, we've seen fits and starts, you see plants restarting and then shutting
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:10.600]   down because there's COVID infections or you see people having trouble staffing, you know,
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:15.440]   the false shift because there's too many cases in the hotspots.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.000]   So it's still fragile.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:24.400]   I mean, it looks quite good, but it's still fragile.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.400]   Right.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.400]   That's helpful.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.400]   Thank you, John Margin.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.720]   I guess that's a good lead-in to the next question.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:36.320]   So when you think about your customers, you know, we've had some shutdowns, we've had
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.720]   things come back online.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:42.740]   Do you feel that your customers and their CEOs are getting more confidence in their ability
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:48.000]   to stay online or getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curve
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   there?
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   I would think so.
[00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   I think all of us have made tremendous efforts to provide the proper environment for our employees.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.040]   It's very interesting.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:07.920]   I was commenting on the, you know, half of the percent of our employees have been affected
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.800]   by COVID confirmed.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:19.400]   We have had no new case, confirmed case in Europe since the middle of May.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:24.880]   So I think this is saying something about the fact that when people take responsibility
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:31.280]   in their daily lives, right, because it goes beyond what they do within our factories or
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:39.000]   during the eight hours or ten hours, whatever, that they work with us, you can have an impact.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.720]   And I think, you know, if people wear masks when they interact with the outside, with
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.240]   people they come across, I think it makes a tremendous difference.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:58.520]   So I hope the reality will slowly or more than slowly settle in and good practices will
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:04.480]   get that virus away from us sooner rather than later.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.240]   And I think people are seeing the confidence building up.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.840]   I mean, it's human nature.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.640]   You need to be affected to take steps.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.000]   And I think we're in the process where in many places people are still being affected before
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   they take steps.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.040]   But if you look at China, and China is, you know, going extremely strong, you know, it's
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:26.920]   a small operation for us, but we are above budget, above last year, right?
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:32.680]   If you look at Europe, new cases are really on a downward trend, even though there are
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.520]   some clusters here and there, and we're seeing a stronger rebound.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:44.040]   And I hope this is coming to us in the U.S. through the U.S.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.040]   That's great.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.560]   It's good to hear, John Mark, and I hope everybody's safe and well over there.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.280]   Thank you very much, and good luck.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.280]   Thank you.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.280]   Go ahead, sir.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.840]   Go ahead, Joanna.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.560]   Yes, sir, I am showing no further questions at this time.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.600]   I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. John Marcher-Main, CEO of Constellium.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   Go ahead.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.600]   Thank you, Joanna.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.760]   So thanks, everyone, for participating in the call today.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:21.200]   As you can see, we are very focused on facing the crisis, protecting cash flow, and building
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.920]   a stronger Constellium when things are behind us.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.280]   Thank you very much, and look forward to updating you on our progress in Q3.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   Take care.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.280]   Stay well.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.280]   Thank you, speakers.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:36.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.080]   Thank you all for joining.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.240]   You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   Yes, Dan, welcome to the next our Media Group Second Quarter 2020 Results Call.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.800]   Today's call is being recorded.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.560]   I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Giafani and Vessa Relations.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.560]   Please go ahead, sir.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.320]   Thank you, Anna, and welcome, everyone.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.940]   I just want to read the safe harbor language after which we'll get to the actual presentation.
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.920]   All statements and comments made by management during this conference call, other than statements
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.640]   of historical fact, may be deemed forward-looking statements for the purposes of the private
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.200]   security's litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.280]   Next are cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.080]   that may cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.480]   statements made during the call.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.680]   For additional details on these risks or uncertainties, please see Nextar's annual report on Form

[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.120]   and Exchange Commission.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.160]   Nextar undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.060]   as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.200]   With that, it's now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to your host, Nextar
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.600]   Chairman, President, and CEO, Perry, please go ahead.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.880]   Thank you, Joseph, and good morning, everyone.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.360]   Thank you all for joining us to review Nextar's record second quarter results today.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.440]   As we get started, I want to acknowledge the Nextar Nation team members for their frontline
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.400]   essential work and tireless efforts to provide viewers and users with continuous access to
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.420]   local news and other services, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic and recent civil unrest.
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.560]   With our planning and preparation, strong balance sheet, and commitment to our markets and employees,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.000]   I'm proud to say that Nextar has kept our employee roster intact, and our record quarterly results
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.360]   again reflect our team's commitment to flexibility throughout this time.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   As always, our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Carter, is on the call with me this morning.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.520]   Nextar's industry-leading scale and diversification are solid executions, such as our new business
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.320]   strategies and our rapid adoption of cost containment programs at the onset of the pandemic, resulted
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.640]   in record second quarter results with all of our cash flow metrics well above consensus
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640]   expectations.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.720]   The 41 percent rise in second quarter net revenue reflects growth in total television advertising
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.100]   revenue as we grow year-over-year increases in the same station new to television business,
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.920]   and strong shares of political spending in our markets, as well as the 71 percent year-over-year
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.680]   increase in distribution fee revenues.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.000]   As such, despite the economic pressures related to the pandemic, Nextar's top-line growth
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.200]   in operating and expense management disciplines resulted in a 38.7 increase in net income, and
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.680]   record second quarter broadcast cash flow adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow with those net metrics
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.480]   growing 28 percent, 49 percent, and 127 percent respectively on a year-over-year basis.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   As the world continues to address the health and economic challenges brought on by the pandemic,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.320]   the strength of our business model and enterprise-wide focus on managing operations for free cash
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.760]   flow enabled us to bring about 21 percent of every net revenue dollar to the free cash
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.800]   flow line. In the year-to-date period, Nextar has generated approximately $631 million of
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.520]   free cash flow before one-time transaction expenses. By way of comparison, we generated
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.040]   a total of $521 million of free cash flow in all of 2019, so our growth momentum remains
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.140]   strong even before the upcoming benefit of political spending in the back half of the
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.360]   year.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.320]   Being repurchased has made in Q1 we have reduced our share count to approximately 45.5 million
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.040]   shares outstanding, so 2020 year-to-date free cash flow per share amounts to about $13.86
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.200]   per share, and we remain confident in our unique positioning in this environment to again generate
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   significant free cash flow in the current quarter and again in Q4 of this year. Speaking
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.720]   of the full year 2020, it's important to remember that approximately 60 percent of our annual
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.880]   revenue is expected to be derived from contractual distribution fee and political advertising
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.900]   revenue, which is not expected to be materially impacted by the pandemic. Specifically, Nextar
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.840]   has solid visibility in terms of our contractual distribution economics through December of
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.560]   2022. As we completed the multi-year retent submission consent agreements representing
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   approximately 70 percent of our subscribers at year-end 2019, as well as new long-term
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.720]   network affiliation contracts with CBS, Fox and NBC. At the same time, Nextar has a strong
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.880]   balance sheet including approximately $665 million in cash as of June 30 with an access
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.920]   to another $140 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. We continually successfully
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.640]   navigate through the evolving challenges presented by the pandemic based on our core value of
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.520]   serving communities where we operate by delivering leading local news and other critical information
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.160]   and content to viewers, whether on air or online. In this regard, Nextar stations have produced
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.920]   41 separate town hall meetings addressing state and regional responses to the virus. Additionally,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.880]   Nextar has generated over 30 different programs related to recent civil unrest and race relations
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.920]   in our communities. With local news and information, while it's never been more essential for Americans,
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.240]   the pandemic has changed consumers' media consumption habits in ways that showcase the inherent strength
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.040]   of local broadcast television, our content, and Nextar's leading local brands. As the most
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.880]   powerful and trusted voice in the country, more people are turning into their stations
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.080]   local newscasts than ever before. According to Nielsen data, even as states and localities
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.760]   began to reopen in the second quarter, local broadcast television evening news viewership
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.600]   among adults aged 18 to 34 remained impressively high, with year-over-year increases and average
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:04.800]   cumulative weekly impressions in April, May, and June of 151%, 83%, and 89%, respectively.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.640]   Similarly, on the digital front, Nextar's websites and mobile apps grew year-over-year
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:18.880]   page views by 250% to 1.1 billion in April, with total monthly users up 133% to 96 million.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.320]   We continue to generate strong digital audiences throughout the quarter, with weekday and weekend
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.880]   page view traffic across our local websites up 50% and 60% respectively during the months
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.800]   of June compared to the prior year. Additionally, in terms of unique users, Nextar's digital
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.600]   properties ranked number one in the country in local news, number 12 in all of news and
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.000]   information, and were the number 33 site overall domestically in June, as measured by ComScore.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.320]   As the nation's largest producer of local news programming, Nextar's proprietary content
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.840]   provides essential news and information to users and viewers that is unique and relevant
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.520]   to each of the local communities we serve across the United States.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.800]   Now more than ever, viewers rely on television news to stay informed about everything from
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.240]   the latest pandemic developments to the reopening of the economy to the upcoming election. With
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.160]   Nextar's market leading stations and sites, deep local and national reach, and local broadcast
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.280]   record of being the most influential and effective medium for both brands and politicians, we
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.920]   expect to see advertisers continuing to allocate increased spending to our broadcast and digital
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.080]   platforms as this results. Turning back to some second quarter highlights, total television
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:38.640]   advertising revenue increased 18.1% to 319.8 million, including political revenue of 21.6
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.000]   million and core advertising revenue of 298.2 million. While local and national advertisers
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.840]   adapted their media plans during the second quarter, we saw sequential month over month
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.720]   improvement in our same station core advertising revenue performance from April to May, from
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.000]   May to June, and this trend continuing in July. Notwithstanding marketplace challenges, Nextar's
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.520]   local sales initiatives continue to generate healthy levels of new business with second
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.880]   quarter new to television ad revenue rising on both a quarterly sequential and year over
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:16.240]   year basis. In total, our sales team generated $20.7 million of second quarter new to television
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.560]   revenue, marking 11.3% rise over the first quarter and a 4.5% rise over the comparable
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.520]   2019 period. As I mentioned at the outset of our call, our new business strategies, ongoing
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.800]   sales training, education, and deployment of performance focused initiatives combined
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.280]   with our sharing of best practices have proven very effective in our ability to capture ad
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.440]   spend share in both broadcast and digital locally. We recorded healthy levels of Q2 spending
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.400]   by political action committees and from candidates with 2020 second quarter political revenue
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.200]   of $21.6 million exceeding our expectations from early in the quarter, despite the cancellation
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.880]   of some primaries. Both presidential campaigns recently generated record levels of fundraising
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.400]   which bodes well for our upcoming political revenues trajectory, as such, our full year
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:12.240]   2020 expectation for net political revenue in the low $400 million range remains unchanged.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.640]   Recent distribution agreement renewals and the inclusion of WGN America resulted in a
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:26.680]   71% rise in second quarter distribution revenue to $536.5 million representing nearly 59% of
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:32.320]   total net revenue. Second quarter 2020 total digital revenue declined by approximately
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.360]   $9.6 million or 17% reflecting our focus on higher margin profitable operations while digital
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.880]   profitability was up substantially over the comparable prior year period as our website
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.640]   and mobile app engagement also rose significantly. Total combined second quarter digital and distribution
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:58.480]   fee revenue of $583.2 million rose approximately 57.1% over the prior year period and priced
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.720]   64% of quarterly revenues up from 57% in the year ago period. The year over year increase
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.520]   in second quarter distribution revenue reflects the new agreements reached in the second half
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.200]   of 2019 and a realization of Trudian media revenue synergies related to the after-acquired
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:20.320]   clauses in our retransmission consent contracts and as noted the inclusion of WGN America.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.520]   Our expectations for net retrans growth remain unchanged for the balance of the year in the
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.680]   mid-teens percentage range reflecting new long-term network affiliation agreements
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:34.560]   with CVS Fox and NBC completed in the second half of 2019 and as a result over 80% of our
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.560]   big four affiliations are contracted through December 31 of 2021 and over 70% of our big
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:48.000]   four affiliations are contracted through December 31 of 2022. With our successful 2019 renewal
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.080]   of retransmission consent agreements representing approximately 70% of our subscriber base with
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.080]   approximately 17% of the base to be renewed this year our significant net retrans revenue
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.840]   growth in 2020 will complement the strong political growth and spending that we're seeing. Taken
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.360]   together the affiliation renewals which also include OTT agreements, our new retrans contracts
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.480]   and sub levels that remain in line with our forecast. We have pretty clear visibility
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.200]   for net retrans revenue growth expectations in 2020 and beyond. As we discussed on the
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:23.080]   last call at the onset of the pandemic we took immediate action to adapt our business to
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.840]   address the economic impact on the US commercial advertising market. We implemented a range
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.000]   of cost-cutting initiatives which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings in
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.300]   excess of $40 million from budgeted second quarter levels. Looking at the third quarter while
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.800]   the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising we're seeing the same pattern
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.480]   of month-over-month improvement in our pacing data and expect to benefit from significantly
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.280]   increased levels of political ad spending and in fact our July political billing exceeded
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.040]   that of all of Q2. Overall we're encouraged by continuing signs of recovery across our
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.400]   station footprint and by key economic indicators including employment data and consumer spending
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:09.080]   and at present we're cautiously optimistic about the return of live sports as live news
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.640]   and sports programming continues to generate the strongest levels of viewership across
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:20.400]   our all demographics. Additionally preparations for the September 1 launch of WGN America's
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.720]   primetime national newscast News Nation which will reach approximately 75 million households
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.780]   across the country are proceeding on schedule and on budget. We're in rehearsals now and my
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:36.840]   first impressions of the product are very positive. News Nation will air daily from 8 p.m. to 11
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:43.320]   p.m. ET and will draw on the local regional and national expertise of NextGar's 5,400 journalists
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.200]   and 110 local newsrooms across the country and during the quarter we announced the anchor
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.800]   teams and correspondents for our live three-hour primetime national newscasts were already attracting
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:58.760]   strong interest from leading national advertisers at much higher than normal cost per points for
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:05.160]   WGN America. Broadcasts will deliver news reporting that is fact-based, impactful and unbiased
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.840]   and we're confident that there are more Americans than ever before that were seeking just that.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.560]   In addition to the live nightly newscast News Nation's team of reporters and producers will
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.320]   deliver news 24 hours a day online through News Nation's soon to be launched app News Nation
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.800]   Now which will create another opportunity for monetization and revenue diversification.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.720]   As always we remain committed through generating free cash flow, actively managing our capital
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.000]   structure, our cost of capital and our liquidity position to provide the financial flexibility
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.200]   to support our business and enhance shareholder returns as we emerge from the pandemic. During
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:47.520]   the first half of 2020 we allocated approximately 594 million in cash from operations and investments
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.120]   toward debt reduction, opportunistic share repurchases and cash dividends. Personally as I mentioned
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.640]   before Nexar continues to maintain a strong balance sheet including 665 maintenance cash on hand at
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:04.240]   June 30 with access to additional 140 million under our revolving credit facility. On the return of
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.960]   capital front in late June we declared our third quarterly cash dividend at a the new 56th per share
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:18.080]   level which was 24 percent ahead of last year's payout. With our 191% year-to-date free cash flow
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.720]   growth, our contractual distribution fee revenues, our food network distributions, our historically low
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.520]   LIBOR rates which have reduced our interest expense and what is projected to be the biggest presidential
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.560]   election cycle in the company's history we remain confident in our positioning to be free cash flow
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.840]   positive in every quarter of 2020 and we continue to expect Nexar's net leverage to decline to
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.840]   approximately four times by year end. In summary while the pandemic has presented challenges for most
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.920]   every industry Nexar's leading local platforms are well positioned to continue building the top line
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.120]   maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet. Over time our
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.600]   disciplines in these areas have strengthened the resiliency of our business and our business model
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.960]   and created an unrivaled local marketing platform while supporting increasing growing and growing
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.000]   returns for our shareholders. With that said let me turn the call over to Tom Carter for our financial
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.320]   review and update. Tom. Thanks Perry and good morning everybody. As outlined in this morning's press
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:24.000]   release the actual results for the three and six months ended June 30 2020 reflect the company's
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.120]   legacy Nexar operations and results from Tribune media stations which were acquired on September
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:38.880]   19 2019. Second quarter 2020 revenue from WG and America also acquired in the Tribune transaction
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:44.960]   is included in core television advertising revenue and distribution fee revenue. Contribution from
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:51.360]   Nexar's 31.3 percent ownership stake in television food network and other investments acquired in
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   the Tribune transaction is included in the full income statement under income or loss on equity
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   investments net and in the cash flow statement under distributions from equity investments. A comparable
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.920]   three and six month period ended June 30 2019 reflects legacy Nexar operations during that period.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:16.160]   All actual results also reflect the impact of one-time transaction expenses incurred in the
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:22.960]   quarters both in the quarters and the six month period ending June 30 2020 and June 30 2019.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.200]   With that with a review of Nexar's Q2 income statement and balance sheet data after which
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:35.280]   I'll provide an update on our capital structure and some points of guidance. On a combined company
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:41.680]   basis and pro forma for the invested station second quarter same station net total revenue
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:48.400]   was down six percent due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately 35
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.960]   percent reflecting a sharp decline in April due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   improvement from April to May from May to June. Same station distribution fee revenue was up 28
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:10.720]   percent and continuing digital revenues were down 18.2 percent reflecting local agency services
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.800]   revenue growth of approximately 8 percent while station website revenue was down approximately
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:23.920]   30 percent due to software local customer buying trends related to the pandemic. To offset the
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.360]   anticipated impact of COVID-19 on commercial advertising revenue late in the first quarter
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.480]   Nexar implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives which resulted in operating and
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.240]   corporate expense savings in excess of 40 million dollars from budgeted levels in the second quarter
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.240]   of 2020. Second quarter station direct operating expenses net of trade expense were approximately
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:52.160]   414 million up from 292 million in the prior year primarily reflecting the full quarter of
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.680]   incremental expenses associated with the tribune operations and the budgeted growth in network
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.600]   affiliation expense as a partial offset to our rising distribution revenue. Second quarter
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:11.440]   station SG&A was approximately 158 million inclusive of the tribune operations. Same station pro forma
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:18.560]   fixed expenses excluding programming expenses were down 18 percent over the year over year period
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.640]   due to synergies related from the tribune acquisition and the previously mentioned expense reduction
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:31.920]   activities in response to the pandemic. Corporate expenses were 35 million inclusive of 13 million
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:38.000]   of stock-based comp and approximately 5.4 million of one-time transaction expenses. When excluding
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.640]   non-cash top and one-time transaction expenses recurring corporate expenses were approximately
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.440]   17 million which came in better than the guidance we had provided in the first quarter call of
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:56.240]   approximately 21.5 million. By the end of April the vast majority of the initial operating synergies
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:03.360]   of the trans tribune transaction have been realized. Second quarter operating cash taxes were
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:09.120]   approximately six million dollars substantially lower than our guidance of 45 to 50 million
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   due to a timing difference. That 40 to 45 million dollar variance will now be paid in Q3.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:24.640]   Ongoing CAPEX and transaction CAPEX total 40 million dollars spectrum repack CAPEX total
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.560]   13 million and received approximately 26 million of reimbursements from the FCC during the quarter.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:36.400]   As a reminder we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all spectrum related CAPEX over the course of
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.880]   the year. Second quarter total interest expense amounted to 82 million up from 51 million in the
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:49.760]   same period in 2019 while cash interest expense was 78 million compared to 49 million last year
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.600]   with increases due to obviously the increased debt associated with the tribune funding partially
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.320]   offset by lower interest rates. Second quarter broadcast cash flow of 291 million as well as adjusted
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:09.440]   EBITDA 298 million and free cash flow of 200 million all pre-transaction expenses exceeded
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.880]   consensus expectations and primarily reflect the realization of synergies and growth related
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:21.120]   to the tribune transaction distribution free distribution agreement renewals executed
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:26.560]   in the second half of the year and the deferred tax cash taxes as I mentioned before adjusted
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:32.800]   EBITDA and free cash flow reflect approximately 27 million dollars in distributions from equity
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.880]   investments related to our 31 ownership in the TV Food Network. As a reminder we received
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.960]   cash distributions from TV Food on a quarterly basis with the largest payment recorded during
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.400]   the first quarter of each year. For the third quarter of 2020 we anticipate recording approximately
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:57.680]   12 million dollars in TV Food Network distributions. We expect cost savings in Q3 to approximate
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:04.800]   25 million dollars relative to the originally budgeted levels as variable cost and discretionary
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.880]   expenditures are prudently brought back online with the expected strengthening of the economy
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:17.040]   and the broadcasting advertising environment. For the third quarter we project recurring cash
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:23.040]   corporate overhead exclusive of stock comp and transactions cost to be approximately 23 million
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.760]   dollars and we will easily meet our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance for approximately
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:35.120]   120 million dollars for the entire year. Non-cash comp is projected to be approximately 13 million
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.720]   dollars for the quarter and 48 million dollars for the full year transaction expenses will
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.360]   approximate three million dollars for the quarter and will decline for the remainder part of the year.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:52.240]   Third quarter operating cash taxes are now estimated to be approximately 150 million dollars
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.760]   and operating cash taxes for the entire year will now come in at approximately 250 million dollars
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:03.840]   in total. Non-operating cash taxes associated with the gains on the asset sales and legal
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:10.720]   settlements in Q3 will be approximately 83 million. Third quarter TAPX should come in at approximately
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.160]   40 million and we're still expecting approximately 160 million dollars for the entire year. We're
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.800]   proceeding on budget with our investment related to the launch of WGN America's primetime national
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:27.040]   newscast news nation on September 1st and prioritize capital expenditures to maintain
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.400]   to maintain maximum flexibility in the current environment meaning the timing of certain TAPX
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:39.440]   can be delayed until later quarters if required. Finally we expect Nextar's cash interest expense
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:46.080]   to approximately 78 million for the third quarter and 325 to 350 million for the full year reflecting
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:52.640]   interest expense savings related to the decline in LIBOR rates. Turning to the balance sheet Nextar's
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:58.560]   outstanding debt at June 30 was approximately eight billion dollars and consisted of 5.4 billion
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:05.440]   of term loans and two series of senior subordinated notes one at approximately 900 million dollars
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:13.920]   and the other at 1.8 billion dollars with maturities of 2024 and 2027 respectively. Total net
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:22.240]   debt approximated 7.4 billion at June 30 compared to 7.6 billion at March 31st and 8.3 billion at
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:31.920]   1231 2019. Net debt for first lien covenant purposes is 5.2 billion with net debt net cash limited to
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:38.160]   a 200 million dollar amount. Our first lien covenant ratio at June 30th was approximately
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:46.240]   3.11 compared to 3.52 at year end which is well below our first lien covenant of 4.25. As a reminder
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.400]   our first lien covenant limits cash netting to approximately 200 million. Our total net leverage
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:59.520]   at quarter end was 4.47 compared to 5.18 at year end and as a reminder Nextar's only covenant
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:07.120]   is our first lien debt covenant which is the aforementioned 4.25. At the onset of the pandemic
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.240]   Nextar took immediate actions to adopt our business to the current environment to preserve liquidity
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.760]   in order to best position the company for long term success as we return to normalized operations.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.680]   In this regard we continue to prioritize cash retention and add approximately 231 million
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:30.160]   to our first quarter cash position for a total cash balance of 665 million at June 30th with an
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.120]   additional 140 million dollars available under our evolving credit facility. At the same time
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.000]   during the second quarter we returned approximately 25 million dollars to shareholders through the
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.040]   quarterly cash dividend and made 13 million dollars in payments on our debt. During the first half of
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:53.200]   2020 we have accurately managed our capital structure cost of capital and liquidity position to support
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:59.040]   our business in this challenging environment while enhancing shareholder returns. Year to date we
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.120]   have allocated approximately 594 million towards shareholder value creating initiatives including
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.920]   473 million dollars in debt reduction, 51 million dollars in dividend payments and 73 million dollars
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.600]   in share repurchase. In the near time while preliminary data suggests ongoing sequential
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.720]   improvement in economic trends and the commercial advertising environment we continue to focus on
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.360]   cash preservation in order to optimize our financial flexibility as we move through the third quarter.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.880]   Looking ahead with continued double digit year over year growth and distribution revenue
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.920]   and what are expected to be robust spending levels related to the upcoming presidential election
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:43.280]   which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus. We have excellent visibility
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:49.600]   on over 50 percent of our annual revenue in 2020. As such we expect to breathe free cash flow positive
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:54.320]   in the third and fourth quarters. In addition to continuing our dividend payments we remain
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.040]   committed to allocating the vast majority of our free cash flow towards leverage reduction
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:05.920]   and confident in reaching our target level for the reduced level of total net leverage to four times
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.880]   by year end 2020. The next star has already made significant progress on our leverage reduction
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:16.640]   plan and we enjoy a strong cash position with additional capacity under our remover. In addition
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.720]   the reduction of interest rate expense related to favorable LIBOR rates operating expense savings
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:29.280]   and our capital allocation prioritization will also serve us well in the second half of 2020.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.600]   As a result we're confident in our liquidity position and ability to service our debt through
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.960]   these challenging times and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues as we move through the year.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:46.160]   In summary despite the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic our scale leadership flexibility
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.360]   synergy realization and operation plans are generating results. Our capital structure is
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.360]   in great shape from a cost of capital maturity and ability to quickly address leverage. In addition
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:02.400]   our service to our local communities and local and national advertisers has never been stronger.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.440]   Our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth as well as consistency
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.040]   and visibility to our results and we remain confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.600]   in the near term and on the other side of the pandemic. That concludes the financial review
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.640]   for the call. I'll now turn it over back to Perry for some closing remarks before Q&A.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:29.440]   Thanks very much, Tom. In summary I hope that our comments today reinforce the fact that we
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:35.200]   remain confident in the strength and the resilience of NeXTAR's scaled and diversified business model.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.480]   NeXTAR's leading local platform is well positioned to withstand this environment due to several
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.760]   factors including our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs, the continued growth
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.080]   of our distribution revenue stream and what are projected to be record levels of political spending
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.520]   here in 2020. In terms of capital allocation we believe that our free cash flow combined with
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.640]   the active management of both our cost structure and our balance sheet will provide us with financial
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:06.320]   flexibility to continue supporting our shareholder value creation initiatives. As a result NeXTAR
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.720]   is well positioned to fully participate in the recovery and we remain highly confident in our
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:16.160]   core strategies in terms of serving the communities where we have operations and building the top
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.120]   line maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.800]   This focus combined with our time proven operating strategies is enabling NeXTAR to overcome the
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.760]   near term challenges and extend our long term record of growth and shareholder value creation.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:37.040]   We look forward very much to catching up with you with another positive report just after
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.240]   election day and on behalf of the entire NeXTAR Nation our board and our management team thank you
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.360]   for your continued interest support and for joining us today. So now let's open the call
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:54.560]   to Q&A to address your specific areas of interest operator. Yes sir thank you and if you would like
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:00.080]   to ask a question please click my pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If we are using
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   a speakerphone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:10.400]   equipment. Again that is star one if you would like to ask a question and we'll take our first
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:18.560]   question from John Janites with Wolf Research. Thank you. Bariat, two for you. One is you talked
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:24.160]   about local news and viewership. What are you seeing in terms of advertised your demand in
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.680]   growth in news relative to the day parts given the ratings you spoke to and then I guess the
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.200]   sub-levels and line of expectations is the reintroduce that there's been no noticeable impact
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:42.560]   from the pandemic or is actually students of call given the life. Well as relates to local news you
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:48.000]   know through the first six months of this year 51 percent of our total advertising revenue came from
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.880]   local news and that's up over the prior years cumulative totals which indicates obviously
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:01.040]   advertisers you know are putting their money into that product and increasing with increasing
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:07.600]   frequency. Obviously the demand is where the audience is and that's where the audience is for
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:15.360]   us right now and so we do see continued read through and we're hopeful that the audience gains at least
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.000]   some of them will be sticky when you know and I hate to use this term when when the new normal
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.520]   settles in as to whatever that is but so far through this normal people in all age groups
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:33.040]   are tuning to our local news broadcasts in increasing numbers. I will say that I mean obviously
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.400]   MBPD's have reported sub-counts and attrition for the quarter you know those are factored into
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:47.040]   into our projections and analyses and and our retrans revenue is again we we forecast attrition
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:52.960]   into our budgeting process and and we are we are at budget on retrans revenue and our projections
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:58.800]   through through the end of this year so we have seen no significant decline beyond what we had
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.840]   forecasted so we think it's business as usual from a distribution revenue standpoint.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.400]   Thanks very much.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:12.800]   Our next question will come from Steven Call with Wells Fargo.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.920]   Thanks wondering if you could talk a little bit about your reverse compensation agreement
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.040]   as sub declines are accelerating I was wondering if that's changing the tone of those at all
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:32.000]   and also does it make you think about moving from like a per sub basis sorry to a per sub basis from
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.160]   a fixed programming fee where you can and and relatedly we have more broadcast content going
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.280]   direct to consumer like CBS all access and Peacock so how do you think about monetizing
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.360]   those households that may not be subscribing through the traditional process?
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:55.040]   Sure you know I would say you know the the current relationships with the networks are a mix of you
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:03.680]   know fixed fee and and percentages of distribution revenues so there are some that that are fungible
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.800]   and others that that are not and those conversations are continuing what's in the best interest of
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:15.360]   both parties to get a deal done so there is some some hedge there at this point and we're you know
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:21.120]   we're not ready to call the ball as to what the the most preferable preferable term is they're
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:28.480]   based on our negotiating ability as it relates to CBS all access we participate in that we're paid
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:34.640]   to be a part of that service and our local stream is a part of that offering Peacock we are not
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:42.720]   affiliated local news affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast offering and we're
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:48.560]   not sure if at any point they will be but you know we do have this thing called over the air which
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:55.280]   you know we we reach you know a a much larger universe potentially than the wired and pay cable
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:02.480]   universe already where you know 16 percent of our viewers already use that as their as their reception
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:08.480]   device without the aid of a paywall and that's available to to those who want to quote stream us
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.800]   that way if you will and the the good news about that is there are far few competitors for eyeballs
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:22.640]   in a in an over-the-air world than there are in a 500 plus cable or satellite universe so again we
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:29.600]   we are in flux we have a lot of our agreements nailed down through 21 and 22 we do have some
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.480]   that will be up at the end of this year and early next year and that's where those conversations
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:39.840]   will we'll center around what's the best type of agreement for both companies to enter into
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:46.080]   great and then just one on political four years ago we kind of got a headache at the last minute
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:51.680]   from the trump campaign in terms of not spending what was expected i don't think any of us expect
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.000]   that to happen this time but when do you feel comfortable that there's not going to be any
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.840]   negative surprises on the political spending side well i'm pretty comfortable in that right now
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:06.880]   i mean look at the amount of money that both camps have raised that the attendant packs
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:12.400]   and special interest groups have raised supporting those candidates as well as down down valid candidates
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.320]   um you know there are no guarantees in this business but as close as a guarantee as i'll
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.800]   make you as there'll be no negative surprise on political advertising that's a pretty good
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   guarantee thank you we'll now take our next question from zach silver with b reilly
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.240]   okay great thanks for hearing the question the first one is just if you can quantify
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:42.400]   the sequential improvement for core in july versus uh total 2p 20 or even the pro forma
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.880]   year-over-year change so far in july and then more broadly and i think it's a little bit related
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.960]   to steven's question you know the narrative out there has been that the macro environment and
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.240]   growth and streaming has is going to accelerate the shift of ad dollars from linear tv to connected
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:02.000]   tv and streaming can you talk about how well positioned you are to address that if that narrative
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:10.080]   does turn out to play out um i'll let you address that how linear you want to get on on guidance
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:16.000]   obviously we saw substantial sequential improvement in core ad trends in july versus
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.200]   not only june but the entire quarter um tom i don't know if you want to add any more details
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:28.480]   to that but um i'll let you speak to that sure well i think uh what i'll say about july is obviously
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:35.200]   july was substantially better than the second quarter as a whole and july was better than
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:41.040]   the last month of the second quarter so sequentially things have gotten better and that trend continues
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:51.840]   into early q3 but as it relates to um additional streaming services um you know they're at some
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:59.120]   point there becomes not kind of a sameness to them and and uh you know um it's all about the content
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.400]   if you have the content that people want they will find a way to consume you whether that's
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.240]   over the air or whether that's through a pay service or through a streaming service that
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:15.680]   we're paid to be on and without our services you have an inferior offering to the viewing public
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:21.520]   is obviously demonstrated that local news is a product that people want and are willing to pay
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:27.360]   for and so i think we'll just stand by that uh you know it's it's a lot less noisy at the operating
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.720]   level than it is perhaps at the investor level about these streaming services you know is it a
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:39.520]   fragmenting universe but are they just taking from a from a wire you know from a from a traditional
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:46.080]   pay tv universe into a virtual pay tv universe and if so and we're on both sides of that transaction
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:52.400]   it's not uh you know it's not nearly the the noise that that it appears to be in the investment
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.120]   community so we're somewhat sanguine about it you know we we have a product that people want
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:02.320]   we're the largest producer of it in the country it's called local news and and we believe that
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:08.480]   product will stand the test of time as it has for the last 40 years test of time yeah i think
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:14.640]   that makes sense and one more if i could uh does the i guess for tom does the target leverage ratio
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.600]   for this year contemplate uh any buybacks in the second half and can you remind us of where we
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:30.320]   are in resuming uh your purchase program thanks um it does i won't say how much of it um is allocated
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:37.680]   to stock repurchases the way we think we we have an authorization left uh from the board
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:45.200]   we're currently not buying stock um but i would anticipate that to get revisited here in the
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:51.680]   not too distant future the way we think about it is really starting on labor day and and quite honestly
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:58.400]   that's probably uh not doing service to the fact that is pretty mentioned july political revenue
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:04.640]   was very strong and we think august will be as well we're rapidly transitioning out of this
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:12.480]   being a story um during the pandemic just about poor advertising revenue and what's happening there
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:19.520]   the the other leg two legs to the stool from our perspective um distribution revenue has been
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.480]   strong continues to be strong as perry mentioned we're on budget for the year we're on budget for
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.280]   the second we were on we were actually above budget for the second quarter we're on budget
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:35.120]   for the third quarter with regard to retransmission revenues and then the third leg of the stool
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:41.520]   is political and that's really going that candle is going to get lit um here right around labor
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:48.160]   day and run really hard for the two months of september october and the first week of november
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:55.520]   so the free cash flow of the company will continue to uh go along nicely and then get turbo charged
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:01.600]   by free cash flow from political beginning around labor day as i've said to other people
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:10.320]   i fully expect our um our capital allocation attitude to change from playing defense to playing
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:17.040]   offense sometime right around labor day we're not there yet but i can see there from here
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   and when that happens then i would imagine we wouldn't sit here with an unnatural 600 million
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:31.040]   dollars of cash on our balance sheet we deploy that by actually repaying debt and looking at
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:38.000]   stock repurchases but that's a multi variable equation tell me what the stock is around that time and
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.680]   i'll tell you what our appetite is right is that responsive that yeah that's helpful thank you both
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:51.520]   i just want to add to tom's comment about political if you most folks woke up this morning
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.160]   reading about the you know biden's uh buy that he's placing starting on september
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:05.520]   first in uh 15 states well we operate substantial operations in 12 of those 15 states so uh just
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.880]   to point out that you know political will reach a crescendo uh around labor day that will continue
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:17.760]   on through the first week of november and again with July results being above all of second quarter
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.440]   for political uh you know that's a pretty good pretty good measure i think of what's yet to come
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.400]   and so we remain confident in our political guidance and as that story continues to prove
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:33.840]   then i think you'll see uh tom exercise more optionality around our cash forward that currently
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:43.840]   exists on the balance sheet got it thank you well now here's our next question from erin
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:54.800]   guys thanks for having me on a couple questions on the ad environment i guess first there's been
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:00.400]   some fits and starts in terms of covid cases uh in the pockets of the country what behavior
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:07.600]   in your markets that have been affected by that uh and i i guess on a related note in terms of
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:13.280]   categories it's given the importance of the auto category um anything you can give us in terms of
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:18.640]   how that rebound is shaping up and what you're expecting from auto in the next couple months
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:27.280]   yeah auto uh has rebounded you know we're seeing better uh better pacing and better results in q
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:36.160]   three than we did in q2 when dealers were shut down we're seeing certain of the oems move
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.440]   money around from market to market based on where they have cars and that's primarily affected
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:48.320]   some of the foreign nameplace but on the whole i think the our expectations for auto are that it
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:55.120]   will be left down sequentially going forward as will most of core advertising um as it related to
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:01.280]   covid i didn't know if you meant how it affected the company uh or what what we're seeing in our
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:10.720]   markets um but i can give you a little color on both uh we have had 145 uh confirmed cases
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:17.760]   in the company um since the beginning of the pandemic um remarkably out of a workforce of
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:23.360]   about 13 000 that that's you know that a people that are out in the community um we've only had
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:29.920]   one hospitalization and that person is fully recovered um about 60 percent of our employees
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:36.400]   are working from the facility to which they are assigned we have another 20 percent that are reporting
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.520]   to work but not necessarily in the facility reporters meeting their crews in the field to
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.000]   go to their first assignment and things of that sort and we have another 20 percent that are
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:53.040]   that are uh are working remotely and uh you know i use the example with our board that you know everybody
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.240]   in Topeka is reporting to work however nobody is populating our new york offices because of
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.800]   the the public transportation requirements and they don't feel safe and there's certainly no
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:08.400]   mandate to do that and and so that's kind of a proxy for the country you know we keep tabs by
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:14.000]   every market as to uh you know various stages of reopening i would say that all of our markets
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.480]   have have some degree of reopening some more than others there have been some pauses in california
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:27.280]   and texas and others on on further reopening uh areas have been rolled back you know bars and
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:33.520]   restaurants uh are not necessarily big advertising categories with us to begin with hospitality
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:42.240]   continues to be uh a category where we see no spend to speak of um there is some interest state
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.920]   tourism ads that are going on like if you're in texas come to arkansas and vice versa in okloma
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:54.080]   we're seeing some of that but hospitality for us is a sub two percent category that you know
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:44:00.640]   is not materially driving our top line so erin i don't know if that's the kind of flavor you were
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:08.960]   looking for but i'm happy to answer any more specific follow-up one last one for me and i
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.720]   appreciate the time again uh you spoke to the important local news and the ad revenues that
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:21.040]   come in attached to that to the overall revenue pie uh if we're thinking about the potential that
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:26.240]   maybe nfl football is delayed or college football doesn't happen in the fall how do we think about
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:33.920]   the flow through of that potential and what it could mean to your revenue pie sure well i'm
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.960]   i'm glad you asked that uh it's interesting at the local station level which is where we live
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:47.680]   all sports comprises about 10 percent of our advertising revenue and and of that the nfl comprises
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:54.720]   about 60 percent of that 10 percent so let's just in real round numbers say that ad revenue support
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:45:01.040]   is half of our revenue and nfl is six percent of ten percent of that so we're talking about
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:07.600]   three points of revenue so from an advertising perspective because of the limited avails that
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:14.080]   the local stations get in in all of local sports or all of televised sports that's not local um
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:21.760]   you know it's it's not that big of a contributor but obviously it has an outsized effect on
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:27.920]   viewership on promotional ability and i would say on on the national psyche and on people's morale
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.880]   obviously distributors are very interested in in live sports because they know live sports
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:39.440]   and live news drive viewership but from a pure financial advertising point of view it's uh
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:46.400]   it's not all that material to our top or bottom line okay perfect that's exactly what i was looking
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:46:03.520]   for stay well guys first wondering if you could give us some color on what you're seeing in terms
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:10.240]   of subscriber declines in your markets curious how they compare to the overall industry and
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:17.840]   any color on advertising and distributor reception to news nation and any expectations
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:22.000]   for when you might see some incremental revenue lift from news nation thanks
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:30.880]   i'm i'll let you read the subscriber and then i'll talk about chia and how's that sure
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:38.720]   i would say our experience with subscribers is not materially different than that of the
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:47.200]   the mvp d's obviously we are still getting an uplift from the virtual mvp d so that the
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:53.440]   the traditional mvp d subscriber loss is somewhat recouped but certainly not all recouped by
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:47:02.000]   um by the the virtual mvp d's and as perry had mentioned obviously we factor in in our budgeting
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.640]   process and in our guidance process you know an attrition rate for subscribers and a
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:17.680]   unit rate for our for our revenue and as we mentioned that was basically in line for the
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:24.880]   second quarter and early returns for the third quarter are consistent with that expectation so
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:33.280]   not getting into specific subscriber decline numbers etc i would say that we we see and feel
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:42.800]   the same thing that the you know the the distributors do it's just that our you know our economics are
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:50.640]   a little bit different because we've got you know rate that helps us offset that but it's consistent
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:58.800]   with our expectations as relates to wg in america we have had and you know dana zimmer and her team
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:06.720]   have been out presenting wg in america to every uh mvp d which we already do business and also
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:14.560]   those that do not carry wg n uh wg in america and that's primarily in legacy next star markets uh
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.120]   and and we have an opportunity with renewals between now and the end of the year for an
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:26.000]   incremental approximately 200 to 250 000 subs that could add wg in america now these are smaller
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.440]   systems again where next car has a relationship but there was no trivial relationship that would
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:38.080]   have included wg in america so there is upside there um and and i would say that the reception
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   from distributors has been positive particularly from those who have uh existing contracts and realize
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.720]   there's going to be additional value add for no additional cost during the term of the the
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:58.160]   current agreement we are distributed on at&t now as the the only virtual mvpd assist as service
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:06.720]   that is offering wg in america we are efforting to to get distribution at the launch or or shortly
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:12.880]   thereafter on other otc services and that will be a value add where wg in america is not currently
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.200]   distributed but the reception from both the advertising community and the distribution
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.400]   community has been positive because we're investing in a product that will add value to their businesses
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.720]   as well great thanks thanks very thanks so
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:33.840]   we'll take our next question from damacredos with benchmark
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:40.160]   thanks good morning slimp pickens last year after the strong prints and all the questions
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:46.800]   but uh i guess i'll ask you um one follow-up to the prior perry i don't know if you're willing to
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:52.960]   sort of you know good color on on subcarriage uh incremental opportunity is there any way
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:59.120]   for us to think about sort of timing and how you're thinking about the news nation impact itself
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:06.640]   relative to uh either advertising or uh i guess ancillary with that um your comment on carriage
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.840]   we know it's going to be self funding obviously you have plans to kind of expand it so just any
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:18.400]   help kind of framing your thoughts on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity and then separately
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.840]   you know obviously there's been a lot of noise lately uh in the digital world facebook twitter
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:29.680]   adboy caught up all of that fun stuff um you guys are the largest you guys have a pretty big network
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:34.400]   effect in a pretty strong digital portfolio yourselves is there any accrued benefit to you
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.760]   guys or do you think that stays mostly in the digital bucket thanks
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:46.160]   i'll speak first to uh wg in america the uh we have uh i'm very impressed with the job
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:53.120]   that dav rhodeman and sales team have done in assembling uh advertisers for uh for the premiere
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:51:00.640]   premiere week of wg in america's news nation blue ship names and and at cost per points that are
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:07.840]   in excess of i'm sorry i should say cost per thousands uh that are in excess of 50 percent
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:14.800]   greater than what standard programming was generating alone um so that's a very positive
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:21.600]   initial indication we're trying to rework some of the existing buys into uh the news nation
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:28.800]   prime time offering and uh and so um what we could really use is you know an upfront or a fourth
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:36.000]   quarter scatter market to break but all of that said we do anticipate an incremental let's call it low
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:45.200]   eight figure uh revenue contribution to wg ends add revenue uh in the four months of the of the end
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:50.800]   of this year um and again given the size and scope of the operation that wouldn't be deemed to be
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:57.760]   material but we do even in these conditions expect you know a low a low eight figure uplift in
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:04.000]   gross revenue there and uh and distribution that will mostly come at the end of the year so we'll
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.480]   impact 2021 more than this year there have been some incremental deals done already that will
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:16.320]   launch wg in america uh you know between now in the end of the year but i would say the vast majority
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:22.800]   of that impact would be felt um in uh in uh in 2021 and again you're talking a potential uplift of
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:29.120]   you know a quarter of a million subscribers on a you know nelson reported i think 75 million subscriber
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:34.080]   base so even that is incremental but it but it's all incremental and that's what we're going to do is
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:42.720]   drive incremental growth out of the assets that we own and then the thoughts on either facebook
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   twitter as it relates to core political um if that stays in the digital bucket or if you can pick
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:53.760]   some of that up yeah listen i think the most direct uh transfer could be in political if people you know
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:59.600]   if certain platforms are refusing those ads that money has to go somewhere and you know without
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:05.920]   conventions to fund and without rallies to fund the the one way to reach people is through broadcast
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:10.160]   television i think we're seeing an evidence of that right now so i think that would be probably the
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:15.920]   the direct transfer you know with all the boycats and all of that i i don't think you've seen a substantial
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:24.720]   decline in uh in in digital revenue performance on those platforms um so um at this point the
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:30.960]   damage is more reputational than financial and we'll see you know how deep the government wants
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:37.200]   to get involved in taking a look and potentially regulating these companies more symmetrically
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:44.400]   with the way we're regulated but at this point i i think the financial transfer outside of political
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:50.080]   to the best of our knowledge is is minimal got it super helpful thanks for the color in the next
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:58.240]   quarter thanks our next question will come from Greg Hubbard with Hubbard research partners
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:06.800]   yes good morning thank you um a few questions um last quarter on your conference call i believe
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:13.280]   you guys said your retrans subs were down four four and a half percent year over year um as you
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:19.040]   guys may know uh Sinclair on the call right before yours said the second quarter subs were down about
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:23.920]   seven percent um clean a bit benefit than the virtual side should i assume that you guys were
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.040]   down roughly about seven percent for the second quarter for your subs is that reasonable slightly
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:36.160]   worse than the first order no no should i assume it's a little bit better than that then or can
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:41.520]   you just help me understand uh i i would i would say it's more consistent with the second quarter
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.880]   the second quarter you i'm sorry you need more consistent with the first quarter down four four
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:53.120]   and a half oh i'm sorry with with um with what we announced uh the first quarter you're right
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:58.480]   first quarter so but no i wouldn't say it's down four correct i'm not going to get the exact number
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:05.760]   i've already said that it's not down seven but it's closer to the previous um quarters results
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:17.360]   okay appreciate that um can you help us um your tv advertising pay scenes for the month of august
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   would you say that those are tracking better the rate of decline there if your core advertising
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:26.160]   for that is tracking better than what you or what July turned out to be
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:36.240]   i think it's a little we have very you know few days in august here i'm i'm thinking you know it's a
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.160]   little uh too early to be making any comments with regard to that
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:47.120]   okay can you help us then maybe just i'm trying to understand then what you're
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.640]   sort of budgeting or thinking the rate of decline for your core advertising to be down
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:59.680]   in the third quarter um maybe help us like i think that's why we're not that's why we're not giving
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:06.320]   guidance right i it's going to be down with July again how much July was down if you would
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:12.240]   i think i told you it was down less again i'm not going to give specific numbers
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:20.880]   but july was down less than june and june was obviously if it's just math if the entire quarter
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:27.840]   was down 35 percent and every every month within the second quarter got better then clearly june
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:36.160]   was down less than 35 percent and july was down less than june that's kind of the extent of the
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:42.400]   forward-looking guidance that we're going to give as it relates to specific advertising revenue
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:52.960]   okay um maybe let me ask another question then um in this on this virus situation that's going out
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:58.960]   there in the states where the virus cases have gotten dramatically worse here in the last several
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:05.760]   weeks have you guys seen a material change in the core tv advertising in those markets is there
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:15.200]   any significant change or you can talk talk about that no um and again you know cases in texas have
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.080]   gone down i mean you know you you have but we don't operate just in one one area that you're in that
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:26.480]   you might be hearing that news from right so you've got to look across 114 markets and look at
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:32.720]   you know those states and you know cases might be reported to be up 30 percent which could be 100
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:37.840]   cases in a in a state i mean you've got to put all of these numbers into context but i would say
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:43.760]   no the evidence is in you know in our results in july and our pacing in august and our pacing in
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:49.360]   september all substantially better than where we exited second quarter and then we performed in
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.840]   second quarter so you know the proof is in the numbers as tom says it's just math but you know
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:59.600]   we have not seen any and i think i just said this you know hospitality continues to be down auto
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.160]   is improving we don't get a lot of money from restaurants unless it's qsr and they're making
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:10.720]   mints through their drive-through so uh you know things are we're seeing steadily in steady improvements
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:17.040]   and even we're you know pausing and opening is better than not being open at all and that's
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:22.160]   that's kind of our worst case scenario in some of our markets and in others uh we don't have that
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.840]   you know this morning we're dealing with the aftermath of storms up the east coast from
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:30.800]   the caroline is into virginia and up into uh pennsylvania new york and flooding and those
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.920]   kinds of things and those are going to be more you know temporary disruptors to businesses until
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:42.000]   they they can reopen then then the pandemic and so it's situational and we deal in 38 states across
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.680]   the country and you've got to add it all together but there's you know nothing other than business
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.440]   as usual is the way we deal with things and i think the results speak for themselves
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:57.200]   and my last question guys on the cost front you guys talk about pro forma cost in the second
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:03.040]   quarter down 18 percent can you give us a little bit more to how we should we think about your cost
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:07.760]   trends for the third quarter i know you give a figure there versus your budget for the third
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:12.480]   quarter you have somewhere one for the second quarter but just what sort of cost that you can
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.240]   help us a little bit think about that that may not repeat the cost savings and third quarter you
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:23.120]   benefit from in the second thank you i really don't understand the question other than the fact
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:30.560]   obviously we had um guided to 40 million dollars in cost takeouts in the second quarter which we
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.880]   believe you know which we over performed on that same number for the third quarter is 25 million
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:42.800]   as we obviously some of those are variable costs as advertising starts to return those costs go up
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:49.440]   some of them are discretionary that we will add back in we will travel more in the third quarter
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.520]   than we did in the second quarter we basically couldn't have traveled any less in the second
[00:59:53.520 --> 01:00:00.320]   quarter than we did so some of the discretionary costs will get added back in but that'll be more
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:07.760]   than offset by higher advertising revenues in the second quarter but specifically as it relates to
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:14.880]   you know if you're looking year over year the majority of the synergies taken out of the
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:22.640]   tribune transaction have occurred so that won't change materially sequentially q2 q3 over q2
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:30.080]   and you'll have some added expense coming back in but that's the extent of some of the the pushes
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.600]   and the polls on expenses if you answer it well thank you appreciate that guys
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:43.520]   we'll now take our next question from john cornwright with jk media
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:50.960]   i hope you can hear me having problems like a lot of people in the neighborhood uh two quickies um
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.520]   tom i think the 24 bonds were callable two days ago and i heard nothing
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.240]   does that mean that it's not likely to be called
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:09.360]   well again john i think that's consistent with our message that um you know in the next 30 to 45
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:18.000]   days i think we will have a better um feel on actual political revenue coming in you know labor day
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.280]   and obviously same with another month of core and we'll be able to start making
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.880]   more aggressive decisions with regard to capital allocation
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:35.200]   in the you know obviously in the last 120 days and probably the next 30 days we're still
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:41.040]   going to continue to take a pretty conservative view on that but hopefully be able to flip the
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.640]   switch and become a little bit more aggressive in the in the near term secondly um did i hear
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:58.080]   correctly that the you're on track for mid teams retrain net retrans growth uh this year and you
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:08.080]   mentioned that the growth the gross retrans is up high 20s pro forma did i hear correctly gross
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:18.560]   high 20s net net teams so far this year our our retrans revenue growth has
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:26.480]   exceeded 20 percent but that is correct we have budgeted for mid teams yes well 28 in the second
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:32.160]   quarter um i don't get what exactly the first quarter is we budgeted for mid teams growth
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:41.120]   in um net retrans for the entire year but so far we have exceeded that okay so net but
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:48.960]   retrans margins are down you know more than a little bit this year is that correct no i would
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:56.000]   say that they're actually up a little bit because we're we've included um a fair amount of tribune
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.160]   subscribers that are non big four affiliates where our net retrans margin you know is substantially
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:12.080]   at excess of 50 percent got it thank you very much and we'll now take our next question from
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:21.120]   Jim goss with baron tenry search uh thanks um during the early days of the pandemic there seemed
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:29.360]   to be a surge in or a pretty good increase at least in usage and even sampling um uh of broadcast
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:35.200]   and other video and uh categories that didn't take or didn't tend to
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:51.600]   not sure what happened there um but i was wondering if any of that has proven sustainable
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.960]   if you would like to cancel this request please press star zero again
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.880]   i'm sorry i may have heard
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:10.320]   go ahead jim i think somebody's um trying to either record or exit the call
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:17.680]   okay sorry uh but anyway i was wondering if any of the increased usage and uh sampling
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:24.080]   has proven sustainable or has it mostly dissipated did any of that play a role in your retrans
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:34.720]   negotiations during that period um we had precious few retrans uh negotiations uh done in the first
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:41.600]   half of the year we had one top ten uh that were you know we're pleased with the results on um
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:48.080]   i would say you know in my in my comments earlier i did report that you know our our viewership and
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:55.280]   i i highlighted the 18 to 34 demographic you know obviously was up in april 151 percent 83 percent
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:03.120]   in may and 89 percent in june over the prior year our digital page views which were in excess of
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:09.520]   2.3 billion for the quarter were 1.1 billion in april that was up 133 percent and then in the
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:15.200]   month of june just by comparison our local websites were up 60 percent uh compared to the prior year
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:23.040]   so um you know there is there is some covet fatigue i think uh but i also think there is increased
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:30.480]   interest in local news and we consider ourselves uh to be the last bastion of local news with the
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:37.360]   diminuation of newspaper and radio local coverage and content so um you know we do think that that
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:43.600]   there is stickiness to this you know the long tail will determine how much but um but people continue
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:50.640]   to turn to our newscasts and record numbers and it's amazing you can see atla in los angeles and wgn
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:58.400]   in chicago independent stations by and large but producing copious amounts of local news um
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.040]   are ranking number one in all day cards meeting all of the network o and o's in virtually every
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.240]   newscast and that just speaks to the power of localism that you're not dependent on network
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:13.280]   lead in or lead out to to generate your audience you're doing it on your own and uh and we're
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:19.840]   particularly gratified by by that kind of execution producing those kinds of results
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:27.280]   okay and uh one last thing the uh i was wondering about the promotion efforts to create visibility
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:37.840]   for uh news nation as that is you know coming to the fore and also it seems like uh cnn tended to fill
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:44.320]   a similar similar role to that which you're targeting uh where they tend to be unbiased
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:52.400]   uh maybe it's a little less so these days and it during in that era it would tend to be the place
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:07:01.680]   to go when something an event occurred but it uh some of the other news more pointed uh newscasts
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:10.000]   politically would uh sort of gather the their base uh in more normal times so i'm wondering if
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.640]   if there's a way for you to position yourself to you know sort of gather at least that role
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:22.160]   and maybe you know maybe have something more sustainable and if this proves successful
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.320]   do you think you've broadened it beyond the three hour original timeframe
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:33.040]   well thanks Jim there's a lot in there to unpack i'll i'll try and do my best with it here um
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:39.040]   you know obviously you know that is how cnn started i don't think anyone listening to this call thinks
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:46.720]   cnn is in that same place today uh from an unbiased uh political lean uh we as as i've said before we
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:52.000]   have a staff of rhetoricians and two full-time staff that do nothing but check scripts and reporting for
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.840]   unconscious bias and bias in our writing and and we've had very spirited discussions about
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:05.600]   that even in the rehearsals you know um we uh we do think we will be that place to go for news that
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:12.160]   doesn't make a uh you know 22 minute news hole in a network evening news broadcast or much news on
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:17.680]   the the opinion-based uh you know talk networks um you know for example last night in our rehearsals
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:23.600]   we did a story on the first women police chief in colorado springs and uh that's not a story you'd
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.320]   see every place else but again we've got our we've got the country divided up into six zones and we
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:34.880]   have zone producers and their their job is to know exactly what's going on in those zones in all of
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.320]   those uh newsrooms and what might be of interest to a national audience in addition to the 150 people
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:47.600]   we hired in chicago correspondence that are also based in miami new york dallas los angeles um and
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:53.520]   dc that report exclusively for the network as well as all the behind the scenes production folks that
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:00.720]   um that that we think we can give a more representative view of america than perhaps what's seen inside
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:07.760]   the new york uh dc uh beltway um so we think there's a purpose for that and there's a reason for that
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:14.560]   and the acceptance of that concept now it has been very enthusiastic it's now just on us to deliver
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:22.480]   as it relates to promotion um we have um secured something that none of the other networks news
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:29.520]   networks i think are able to compete with and that is uh to harness the power of 196 television stations
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:36.720]   across the next star nation to promote this newscast on a day-to-day specific basis uh beginning later
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.720]   this month and uh if you look at the annualized promotion value that the stations will be
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:48.400]   contributing on a dedicated basis it's something approaching a hundred million dollars uh we are
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.720]   layering on top of that on an annualized basis approximately 20 million dollars of uh outside
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:00.960]   promotion expense which primarily goes for um advertising on other cable networks because
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:08.720]   we're just a a channel change away at that point on national and syndicated radio we're also uh
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:13.120]   you know investing heavily in social media not only because of the app but to try and drive a younger
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:20.160]   demographic to an alternative newscast and so uh we we think our promotion spending you know all taken
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:26.000]   together you know a nine figure amount of both cash and in kind contributions for the company
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.720]   are another asset that will uh will hopefully drive success for this uh this effort and again it's
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:39.040]   you know it is a counter programming uh opportunity in prime time and we're going to do our best to
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.400]   succeed there obviously if we are successful we would look at other day parts but we're
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:50.320]   taking very much of a crawl walk run approach to this we want to get it right and uh and you know
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:56.080]   we will grow as fast as our success would allow us to grow so i think i i'd leave it at that but you
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:03.200]   know we're we're very excited about the prospect of of introducing an alternative uh in prime time to
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:10.480]   entertainment sports and opinion programming and that the product will will reach a uh we'll
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.880]   we'll strike a chord and and resonate with the audience and then you know audience growth and
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:23.280]   advertiser growth will continue so tune in it launches on september first thank you cash very well
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:31.200]   and that does conclude our question and answer session for today i'd like to turn the conference
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:37.680]   back over to mr for any additional or closing remarks well thank you operator again we're we're
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.880]   very pleased at our progress and we're pleased at our strong financial position and we're excited
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.920]   about the launch of wg in america and the advent of the political spending season that will all
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.920]   be upon us before our next call so we look forward reporting back to you shortly after election day
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.280]   with the the early results on all of those efforts and thank you very much for your time this morning

[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.820]   I would now like to introduce the company's chief financial officer, Mr. Josh Reedy.
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.820]   Mr. Joshua Reedy.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.820]   Thank you.

[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.340]   Thank you, and good morning, everyone.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.460]   On the call with me are Dr. Todd Brady, Aldera's president and chief executive officer, and
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.420]   David McMullen, our chief commercial officer.
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.860]   Dr. Brady will begin with an overview of our recent highlights and upcoming clinical milestones.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.780]   I will discuss our second quarter financial results, and then we'll take your questions.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.580]   Please note that this morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements regarding
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.740]   future events and the future performance of Aldera.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.900]   Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the timing of planned clinical trial
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.380]   initiation, Aldera's possible or assumed future results of operations, expenses, and financial
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.380]   position, business strategies and plans, research development and commercial plans, or expectations,
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.780]   trends market sizing, competitive position, industry environment, and potential growth
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.820]   opportunities, among other things.
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.900]   These statements are based upon the information available to the company today.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.380]   As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical site availability, staffing, and patient recruitment
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.860]   have been negatively affected, and the timelines to complete our clinical trials may be delayed.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.380]   Aldera has no obligation to update these statements as circumstances change.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.620]   Future events and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the company's
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.940]   forward-looking statements, including the current and potential future impact of the COVID-19
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.780]   pandemic on our business, results of operations, and financial positions.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.460]   No information concerning factors that could cause results differ materially from our forward-looking
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.060]   statements are described in greater detail, and the company's press release issued this
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.820]   morning containing financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, and the company's
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.120]   violence with the SEC.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.820]   And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Todd Brady, our President and Chief Executive
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.820]   Officer.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.820]   Thank you, Joshua, and good morning, everyone.
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.740]   As our industry and healthcare first responders continue working together to defeat the worst
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:01.260]   public health crisis in a century, our thoughts are with those affected by COVID-19.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.620]   The seemingly relentless spread of the novel coronavirus has made 2020 a tragic and surreal
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.180]   year, but we remain hopeful and confident in the abilities of our industry to develop the
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.660]   therapies necessary to extinguish this virulent disease.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.660]   I again want to especially thank our team for their work and dedication to our mission developing
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.700]   first-in-class medicines to approve the lives of patients with immunological diseases whose
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.580]   conditions are not being adequately treated by the current standard of care.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.660]   From our perspective, the key pipeline development to the second quarter was our Type C meeting
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.940]   with the FDA, which charted the remaining clinical pathway to an NDA submission for topical oculocular
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.660]   raproxalap in dry eye disease.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.140]   The meeting culminated in an agreement to use levels of reactive aldehyde species or RASP,
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.620]   the therapeutic target for raproxalap, as an objective sign in point for subsequent clinical
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.780]   evaluation.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.980]   In the fourth quarter of this year, we plan to initiate clinical testing to assess the
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.580]   activity of topical oculocular raproxalap in reducing care levels of RASP and other objective
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.780]   signs of dry eye disease, and we expect preliminary results by the end of the year.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.340]   The timing of the clinical trial is, of course, subject to finalization of trial design, RASP
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.540]   assay development and potential disruptions due to COVID-19.
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.460]   Initiation of a safety study in dry eye disease patients is also planned for the fourth quarter,
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.020]   and NDA submission is expected by the end of 2021.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.300]   Our optimism for the use of RASP as an objective sign of dry eye disease is supported by data
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.340]   from our successful Phase 2A trial, in which raproxalap treatment diminished levels of RASP
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.020]   and tears, as measured by ELISA, following 28 days of treatment.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.900]   For the upcoming RASP trials, the longest duration of dosing under consideration is also 28 days,
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.140]   whereas the shortest dosing duration is 1 to 2 days.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.300]   Additionally, the upcoming RASP trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:34.300]   effect of acute changes in dryness on RASP and other signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.220]   We'll be sharing additional details of the protocol following RASP assay validation
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.340]   and FDA requirement, and look forward to providing trial designs shortly.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.860]   From a safety perspective, topgalocular raproxalap already has been evaluated in more than 1,000
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.060]   patients with no observed safety concerns.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.340]   In short, the safety, consistency, and clinically significant activity of raproxalap across numerous
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.020]   clinical trials suggests that raproxalap could be an important addition to the limited number
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.300]   of therapeutic options for dry eye disease, which affects more than 30 million patients
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.300]   in the United States.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.780]   Working at other ocular programs in our pipeline, top line results from the Phase 3 and Vigorate
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.620]   allergen chamber trial of raproxalap and allergic conjunctivitis are expected in the first half
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.500]   of 2021.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.820]   In the retinal disease area in the second quarter of this year, the European Commission granted
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:45.220]   orphan medicinal product designation to ADX2191 for the treatment of retinal detachment, opening
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.900]   a new market opportunity for ADX2191, and the European Union, as drugs receiving the orphan
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.820]   medicinal product designation, are eligible to protocol assistance, research funding, and
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.820]   upon approval, 10 years of EU market exclusivity.
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:09.920]   ADX2191, our novel and proprietary intravitrial methotrexate injection, is being evaluated
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.380]   in the Phase 3 guard trial for proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.980]   PVR is a rare but site-threatening condition and a leading cause of failure of retinal
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.260]   detachment surgery, affecting roughly 4,000 patients per year in the United States, and
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.780]   nearly twice as many in Europe and Japan combined.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.740]   Given the nature of PVR and given the clinical site delays caused by COVID-19, the progress
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.420]   of guard has been slow, although we expect to provide you with an update by the end of
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.420]   this year.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:52.640]   As many of you know, there is no approved therapy for PVR, and ADX2191 has received orphan drug
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.020]   and fast-track designations from the FDA.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:04.980]   ADX2191 is also the subject of our new clinical program in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:11.860]   or PVRL, a rare aggressive high-grade cancer that affects approximately 2,900 people in
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.740]   the United States with about 600 new cases diagnosed annually.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:23.460]   There are no approved treatments for the disease, although the standard of care is pharmacy-compounded
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.740]   methotrexate that has been injected into the eye.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:35.940]   We have recently filed for orphan drug designation for ADX2191 in PVRL.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:42.340]   Turning to our systemic disease program, we are very excited about ADX629, which to our
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:48.560]   knowledge is the first systemically available rasp inhibitor, the clinical testing of which
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.980]   represents the first time systemic rasp inhibition has been assessed clinically, marking an exciting
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.140]   new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism of action.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:07.980]   An IND has been filed with the FDA for phase two clinical testing of ADX629 in patients
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:15.460]   with COVID-19 in order to prevent cytokine release syndrome and respiratory compromise.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.020]   Clinical development is expected to begin this year.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:26.620]   In an animal model of cytokine storm, ADX629 demonstrated a broad and highly statistically
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:33.700]   significant reduction in cytokine levels, including TNF-alpha interferon gamma in IL-17, while
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.980]   upregulating the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.900]   The data suggests that rasp inhibitors have the potential to represent immunological
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:52.780]   switches, which may modulate immune systems from pro-inflammatory states to anti-inflammatory
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.900]   states.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:59.220]   In the fourth quarter of this year, we also expect to initiate clinical trials of ADX629
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:06.140]   in psoriasis, an autoimmune disease, and atopic asthma, an allergic disease.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:13.060]   In combination, trials in COVID-19, psoriasis, and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:19.700]   and the results of the trials will characterize the immune-modulating activity of ADX629 and
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.860]   rasp inhibition more generally.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:32.780]   Switching to ADX1612, our novel HSP90 inhibitor, enrollment has been completed in the investigator-sponsored
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.700]   phase two Udario trial in ovarian cancer.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:44.820]   Regarding the ADX1612 COVID-19 program, consistent with FDA feedback, additional preclinical
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:53.060]   antiviral testing of ADX1612 against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will be performed
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:58.420]   by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has accepted our request to
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.060]   evaluate ADX1612 and in vivo models.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:12.980]   We plan to update on the ADX1612 COVID program by the end of 2020.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:20.180]   We approach the midpoint of the third quarter in a strong financial position, enhancing our
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.380]   flexibility with recent common stock sales to two healthcare-focused funds, preceptive
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:33.300]   advisors and affinity partners. These transactions raise growth proceeds of approximately $19.5
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:39.140]   million, completing our previously announced at-the-market offering program.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:45.180]   We expect our cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations through 2022, including
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:52.980]   potential reproxilap approval in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:58.740]   Now with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Josh for the financial review.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:09.060]   Thanks, Todd. For the quarter-ended June 30, 2020, we reported a net loss of $7.5 million
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:15.980]   compared with a net loss of $13.3 million for the quarter-ended June 30, 2019.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:22.540]   Net loss per share was $0.25 for the quarter-ended June 30, 2020, compared with $0.49 for the
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:28.940]   same period in 2019. Losses have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research and
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:35.500]   development programs, as well as from general and administrative expenses. Research and development
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.500]   expenses were $4.9 million for the quarter-ended June 30, 2020, compared with $10.7 million
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:49.940]   for the same period in 2019. The decrease of $5.8 million is primarily related to a reduction
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:56.620]   in clinical and preclinical development, manufacturing, and personnel costs. General
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:02.260]   and administrative expenses were $2.2 million for the quarter-ended June 30, 2020, compared
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:10.060]   with $3.1 million for the same period in 2019. The decrease of $900,000 is due to lower personnel
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:17.420]   related costs, including stock-based compensation, and other miscellaneous administrative costs.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:23.460]   In the second quarter of 2020, total operating expenses were $7.1 million, compared with total
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:33.200]   operating expenses of $13.7 million for the same period in 2019. As of June 30, 2020, cash,
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:40.740]   cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $66.2 million. Subsequent to June 30,
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:48.300]   2020, $25.2 million in cash was received from at-the-market offering program sales to perceptive
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:56.720]   advisors, validity partners, and other investors. Based on current operating plans, cash, cash
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.700]   equivalents, and marketable securities as of June 30, 2020, plus the additional at-the-market
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.580]   offering program proceeds are expected to be sufficient to fund operations through the
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:15.220]   end of 2022, including potential NDA approvals for raproxal app and dry disease and allergic
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:21.300]   conjunctivitis, assuming positive clinical trial results and planned NDA submissions,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.100]   acceptances, and approvals. Use of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:33.460]   also expected to include the continuation of Part 1 of the Phase 3 Guard trial in PVR
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:40.380]   and Phase 2 clinical testing of ADX629 in orally administered RAS inhibitor in inflammatory
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:48.460]   diseases. Now I'll turn the call back to Todd for closing comments.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:57.740]   Thanks, Josh. We have a number of milestones planned for the second half of 2020, and look
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:03.180]   forward to executing on our clinical development strategy across our ocular and systemic programs.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:09.540]   Looking at our IR calendar next week, we'll be presenting at the BTIG Virtual Biotechnology
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:17.180]   Conference and WEDBUSH PACRO Virtual Healthcare Conference. These events will be webcast.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.900]   Please check the events and presentation section of our website for details. We always look
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.580]   forward to meeting with investors and hope to connect with you at these or other upcoming
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:34.100]   events. As always, we remain committed to executing efficiently in our strategic plan and bringing
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.420]   to market novel therapies that improve the lives of patients with serious unmet medical
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:45.980]   needs. With that, Josh, Dave, and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.860]   At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.700]   telephone keypad that is star one to ask a question. Your first question comes from the
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:02.300]   line of Louise Fen with Cantor. Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So first question
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:07.420]   I have for you is, could you get into more detail on the significance, the FDA's recognition
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:13.180]   of RAST as a sign for dry eye disease is and what that means for you in terms of potential
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.340]   approval and market opportunity? And then the second question I have for you is on your
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:23.060]   COVID trials. How adaptive are those trials in light of the constantly evolving landscape
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.860]   of the treatment of COVID and then how enrollment gone? And then my last question here is you
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.380]   noted that there's been some headwinds to clinical trial progression due to COVID. Can you give
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.140]   more color on which trials may be impacted here? Thank you.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:46.420]   Good morning, Louise, and thanks for your excellent questions. The RAST development is a truly transformative
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:54.740]   for Aldera. RAST is the pharmaceutical target upon which the company was founded many years
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:05.500]   ago. To our knowledge, no company has ever therapeutically addressed RAST and yet RAST represents a very
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:11.660]   broad based anti inflammatory approach that probably applies to many, many diseases, not
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:18.780]   only ocular diseases such as dry eye disease, but also systemic diseases. So for all those
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:26.300]   reasons, we were thrilled about the FDA's decision to classify RAST as an objective sign of dry
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:34.020]   eye disease, which as you know, is an inflammatory condition. What it means practically for the
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:40.940]   company is that the ongoing clinical trial, the clinical trials that are about to start
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:48.100]   regarding the assessment of RAST should be likely to work based on the fact that the mechanism
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:54.620]   of Reproxalap and our other RAST inhibitors is the direct inhibition of RAST. These compounds
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:18:02.900]   bind covalently to RAST. So what we're really measuring is a chemical reaction in vivo and
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:10.860]   in this case in the tear fluid of patients that have been administered Reproxalap. And all that
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:17.340]   leads us to believe that we'll be in a position to file an NDA for dry disease next year as
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:28.060]   we have previously announced. Regarding the COVID trial design, we anticipate for both programs
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:34.300]   enrolling approximately 30 patients. I think they'll likely be a 2 to 1 randomization drug
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:42.020]   to placebo. At this point, we have not included adaptive designs. I think the nature of the
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:48.860]   results of these first trials will help us determine subsequent clinical testing, which is obviously
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:56.020]   going to be much more significant if there are positive results from the preliminary outputs
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:02.460]   that we have here. Enrollment hasn't started. The IND has been filed for 629. As I mentioned
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:13.860]   on the call today, 1612 is the subject of further in vivo investigation in COVID that is being
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:27.020]   performed by NIAAD. And we're absolutely thrilled about NIAAD's decision to test ADX 1612 on our behalf.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:33.500]   The COVID impact, as you mentioned, Louise, across the industry has been significant. The one trial,
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:42.260]   in our case, in our pipeline that has been affected by COVID-19 is the guard trial, the phase 3 guard
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:53.340]   trial for PVR. What seemed to have happened during the peak of COVID cases back in March, April,
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:20:00.900]   May, and so forth was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital. Despite vision
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:11.580]   changes, despite losing sight, the number of patients coming in was diminished during that
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:18.300]   time frame. And furthermore, many clinical sites, as you know, simply did not have research staff,
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:25.500]   which were considered for a while to be non-essential, such that it was difficult, if not impossible in
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:32.860]   some cases to enroll patients. However, the good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline,
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:40.220]   we do not seem to have been overtly affected by COVID in terms of enrollment. The dry eye
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:48.820]   program was largely under discussion with the FDA during the peak number of cases in the spring.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:57.460]   The allergy program, the phase 3 allergy program, was on a planned hold because of pollen. As you
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:03.220]   know, you cannot enroll allergy programs with ambient pollen, and we expect the invigorate program
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:09.820]   to re-initiate again in the fall. So we were quite fortunate in terms of timing with regard to our
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:21.740]   other clinical program to believe relative to the impact of COVID. Okay, thank you. As a reminder,
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.860]   if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:31.300]   keypad, that is star one to ask a question. Your next question comes from the line of Justin
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:40.460]   with Oppenheimer Inc. Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the progress. I know it's early days, but
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:45.860]   as you think about establishing a proximate action on RAST as a sign of dry eye, we've had some
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.700]   discussion with investors on what would be an appropriate duration of observation to assess
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.340]   this activity. Can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the acute versus four week
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:22:02.180]   time points from a trial perspective, disease perspective, and labeling perspective? Right,
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:10.700]   good morning Justin, and good to hear from you. As I highlighted in my comments this morning,
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:16.660]   the potential range of dosing duration for the RAST trials is anywhere from one to two days on the
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:24.020]   acute end to 28 days on the more chronic or sub chronic end, which reflects the phase two A trial.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:29.140]   That is the data in our corporate decks showing that after 28 days of administration of a prox lap,
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:35.540]   there was a highly statistically significant reduction in RAST levels as measured by ELISA.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:43.780]   I want to spend a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure RAST. RAST exists
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:49.580]   in our body in two forms, so-called free RAST that are sort of floating around, and then RAST that
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:57.500]   are bound to proteins. The ELISA measures RAST bound to proteins, and as you know ELISA is an
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:05.700]   antibody-mediated detection assay. The reason why we're able to generate antibodies to bound RAST
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:13.740]   is that when RAST bind to proteins, they're antigens and form antibodies, in some cases antibodies
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:20.460]   against self-protein. So the ELISA measures bound RAST, and bound RAST generally accumulate over
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:27.020]   time, which is why in the phase two A study over 28 days, we use the ELISA to assess RAST levels.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:34.940]   On the other end of the spectrum, regarding one to two day or acute dosing of a prox lap, we think
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:42.900]   that techniques such as LC and RAST might be more relevant to assessing RAST because there we'd be
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:50.020]   looking at free RAST levels that would change acutely following dosing. So somewhere within those
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:59.340]   two ranges of dosing paradigms and those two different assay techniques, we will end up validating the
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:08.060]   precise technique and then establishing protocol design for the first of the RAST studies to begin
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:16.780]   shortly. Okay, great. Got it. And maybe then, you know, how do you think about dosing regimens to be
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:21.500]   investigated? Have you had conversations with the FDA on, you know, whether you'd have to do sort of,
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:28.940]   you know, QID or BID, you know, just to appreciate that you would be tapering in sort of the disease
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:37.100]   state eventually? Right, and that gets back to the first part of your question. How might the clinical
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:46.620]   community perceive duration of dosing and dosing regimens? First of all, I think that signs of
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:56.540]   diseases, including dry eye disease, are primarily or first and foremost regulatory milestones. I do
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:02.620]   not believe, certainly in the case of dry eye disease, that either physicians or patients are
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:09.660]   particularly worried about signs. Patients do not wake up in the morning thinking, I wonder what my
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:17.180]   Shermer test is, I wonder what my corneal stain is, and so forth. Instead, we view signs, and I think most
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:24.940]   patients and physicians use signs as regulatory milestones. So the dosing paradigm for trials
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:31.980]   associated purely with signs, I think is a lot less important. In this case, for one to two dosing,
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:39.740]   one to two-day dosing paradigm, you're thinking of a limited number of doses. For the 28-day
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:46.140]   dosing paradigm, I would expect we would dose QID, which is the first phase of our induction
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:52.380]   maintenance dosing paradigm, which was established with the release of the Phase 3 Renew Trial
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:26:01.500]   back in December. In terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm for raproxilap in general,
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:08.380]   in terms of treating patients, I think that the induction maintenance paradigm established with
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:17.100]   renew over 12 weeks really sets the tone, and more precisely the label for how the drug will be
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:24.780]   used, and that is a QID dosing initially followed by BID dosing for the maintenance phase.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:31.420]   Okay, that's really helpful. Maybe just a clarification question. I know in the press
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:39.820]   leaf it says that there's going to be a dry eye NDA filing by the end of next year. Is the current
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.460]   thinking still to continue on with the concurrent filing? Just, you know, I know later it says
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.540]   that AC is also going to be filed. Just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect them
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:56.780]   together still. Our current thinking is that both will be filed together pending positive clinical
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:03.500]   data, of course. It turns out that the timelines for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:12.140]   continue to overlap. The safety studies, the efficacy studies, the timeline for filing the NDA,
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:19.420]   all of those seem to overlap for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.700]   Which suggests that a concurrent NDA is perhaps the best regulatory strategy, but of course we'll
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:33.180]   have to see how events play out over the latter part of this year and the early part of next year
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:41.020]   before we can guide specifically on the possibility of a concurrent NDA. We really do like the
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:47.260]   concurrent NDA paradigm, however, because of the overlap between dry eye disease and allergic
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:53.900]   conjunctivitis, there seems to be about a 50% overlap such that about half of the patients with dry eye
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.300]   disease complain of ocular itching and about half the patients with allergic conjunctivitis complain
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:06.220]   of dryness and a single compound that could treat both diseases or is indicated for both diseases
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:11.180]   would be highly advantageous not only to physicians but also to patients as well.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:18.060]   Right, great. That makes a lot of sense. My question is just on the safety study,
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:23.100]   is there an expectation for what the size and scope duration as well as the number of patients
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:31.980]   you would anticipate for it? Right, for dry eye disease, my current understanding is that
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:40.460]   the FDA generally requires 100 patients complete one year of dosing. However,
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:49.740]   based on other sponsors' interactions with the agency, we believe that we can file
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:56.860]   based on six months of safety data. So what happens is most sponsors will over enroll,
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:04.620]   they'll begin with more than 100 patients such that they have 100 completers at 12 months,
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:14.380]   and to our knowledge, the safety trials are fairly standard in dry eye disease.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:23.260]   I will say, as I mentioned in my prepared comments that we've tested well over a thousand patients,
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:31.500]   we have seen no safety signals, no changes in intraocular pressure, no retinal findings,
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:40.060]   no aberrant corneal findings, or any other safety signals that would suggest that there
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:45.180]   has been an issue with raprox lap dosing in any patient that's received drugs so far.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:50.300]   Great, great. Thanks again, and I'll hop back in the queue. Yep, thanks, Justin.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:56.540]   And there are no further questions at this time. We'll turn the call back over to Dr. Brady for
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:05.260]   those remarks. Well, thank you all again for joining us today. As always, we look forward
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:11.900]   to keeping you updated on our progress. Have a nice day. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.420]   That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.820]   that you please disconnect your line.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Good morning and welcome to Earthstone Energy Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   If anyone should require operate assistance during the conference, please press star 0 on your telephone keypad.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Joining us today from Earthstone are Robert Anderson, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Lumpkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and Scott Thielander, Vice President of Finance.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Mr. Thielander, you may begin.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Thank you and welcome to our Second Quarter Conference Call.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and Section 21(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Although management believes these statements are based on reasonable expectations, they can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, as described in the earnings announcement we released yesterday,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and in our 2019 annual report on Form 10(k) and subsequent quarterly filings.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   These documents can be found in the investor section of our website, www.earthstoneenergy.com.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   This conference call also includes references to certain non-GAF financial measures, which include adjusted diluted shares, adjusted EBITDAX, adjusted net income, all-in cash costs, cash GNA, and pre-cash flow.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Reconciliations of these non-GAF financial measures to the most directly comparable measure under GAF are contained in our earnings announcement released yesterday.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Also, please note, information on this call speaks only as of today, August 6, 2020.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Thus, any time sensitive information may no longer be accurate at the time of any replay or transcript reading.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   A replay of today's call will be available via webcast by going to the investor section of Earthstone's website, and also by telephone replay.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You can find information about how to access those on our earnings announcement released yesterday.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Today's call will begin with comments from Robert Anderson, our CEO, followed by remarks from our CFO, Mark Lumpkin, regarding financial measures and financial matters and performance.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And then some closing comments from Robert.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I'll now turn the call over to Robert.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone, and appreciate everyone's attendance for our call today. Thanks for making time to join us for our second quarter conference call.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   In the midst of the current pandemic, we continue to take appropriate caution and maintain focus on keeping our personnel safe while continuing to efficiently manage our operations.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Achieving our strong second quarter results in the face of this unprecedented oil price collapse and difficult operating environment is evidence of the resiliency of our business plan and the solid commitment of our people.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Throughout these trying times, we have worked to quickly adjust to the rapidly changing conditions and align our costs with our business activity, as well as preserve our strengths.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   As we have discussed last quarter and in updates along the way stating we would be free cash flow positive from the second quarter on for 2020, we had significant free cash flow of $35 million in this quarter.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   This was driven by several factors, including limited capital expenditures in the quarter as we completed our drilling and completion program for the year, strong hedge position that delivered over $29 million of realizations, and significantly lower operating costs,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   partially as a result of our may shut in and containment program, but also sustainable reductions.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Including the impact of our shut in program, our average daily sales volume in the second quarter was $13,555 barrels of oil equivalent for BOE per day.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Even with reduced volumes and a 44% drop in average realized price per BOE in the second quarter, our cost management efforts combined with the strong hedge position allowed us to generate higher quarter over quarter adjusted net income and adjusted EBITACs.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   We expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the balance of the year, which should result in a decreasing debt balance and help us achieve our target of being below one times debt to EBITACs for the year.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   As we previously discussed in response to the sharp decline in oil prices in April and very low forecasted May oil prices, we made the decision in late April to shut in the large majority of our operated production for the month of May, which resulted in approximately 60% of our total net production being shut in during May.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   With a forecast of significantly improved June oil prices, which ultimately were more than double our April and May oil price realizations, we returned to full production in June.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   We had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions, which saw us reduce total lease operating expense, or LOE, in the second quarter by 40% from the prior quarter.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Despite reduced production volumes due to our shut in program in May, our teams continued focused on cost reductions, resulted in a 30% decrease in LOE per BOE in the second quarter to $4.53 versus $6.51 cents in the first quarter.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   This was the major driver of the overall 33% reduction in all-in cash costs during the quarter.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   On a per-unit basis, our all-in cash costs went from near $13 per BOE in the first quarter to near $10 per BOE in the second quarter for a total 22% reduction.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   This is all-in cash costs, folks, which includes operating costs, corporate G&A costs, and all of our interest costs on our debt.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   To dive a little deeper into how we achieve the 40% decrease in LOE, let me outline some of the key factors.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   First, as much of our peers have done, we were successful in negotiating price reductions with vendors across the broad range of our lease operating expenses, from chemicals to maintenance rigs, saltwater disposal contracts, and compression costs.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Second, we are benefiting from our long-term practice of spending a little more money as we go repairing wells, facilities, and associated equipment to reduce frequency of maintenance, which is resulting in a continued decrease in non-routine LOE repair needs.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Third, workover repairs have trended down, resulting from our optimization of lift method, chemical program improvements, and general approach of fixing things right the first time.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   The limited offset frack activity also reduced frack-hit related workover expenses. Fourth, we have been successful in getting the utility companies to perform electrical upgrades sooner than scheduled, which has allowed us to eliminate generator usage on some of our newer locations.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Lastly, with limited drilling and completion activity, we have also been able to refocus our field employees towards lease maintenance, which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   All of these items and many other subtleties of operating were in progress as our team has a history of continually driving down costs. We will remain focused on continuing to reduce costs across the board as we expect the oil price environment that we have observed since late 2014, including increased volatility, to persist, which only stresses the need to structure our business to be profitable across a much lower oil price range.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I'd really like to commend our operations team, which did a fantastic job of both shutting in production in May and bringing production back fully online in June, while also achieving these cost reductions.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   For the first time in my career, in our team's history, we had to tell our guys to produce as little as possible every single day.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   We executed these shut-in operations, and our field personnel did a great job of efficiently returning wells to production with little to no incremental expense and no adverse effects on our producers.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Our wells have returned to their previous volumes, with some wells producing at increased rates for a period of time.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Plus, the three wells in Southeast Reagan County that were brought online in April prior to the curtailment, and were shut in during May, are now back online and have fully cleaned up and are performing well versus the tight curve.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in late May, and released our contracted rig operating in the Midland Basin.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   So our planned capital expenditures are minimal for the balance of the year, given that our program ended with 11 wells drilled but not completed.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And with our ample liquidity, we have optionality on completion timing, depending on market conditions.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   With production return to full capacity, we have entered the second half of this year with expectations for no further drilling or completion activity this year.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   We can maintain approximately flat year over year production in 2020 compared to 2019.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   As a reminder, we recently updated our 2020 full year production guidance, ranging from 13,000 to 14,000 BOE per day, which compares to 2019 full year average of 13,429 BOE per day.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Further, with our 11 drilled but uncompleted wells in Upton County, we intend to carefully monitor commodity pricing, appropriate service availability, and service cost conditions to determine if it makes sense to bring in a completion crew later this year or wait until early next year.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Depending on the timing, we anticipate the completion of those 11 wells would enable us to maintain similar year over year production for 2021, with only a modest capital program for the completions, which we currently estimate at around $30 million.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   With that overview, I'll now turn the call over to Mark to review the financials.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Have at it, Mark.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Thank you, Robert.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   As we have in the past two consecutive quarters, I'd like to first discuss our cash position and our balance sheet. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased to have achieved our goal of generating substantial free cash flow in the quarter with a total of $35.1 million of free cash flow.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   As we referenced in our first quarter call, our plan was first to reduce our working capital deficit, which we calculate excluding derivatives, and we're able to do this by a low over $50 million during the second quarter, and then to begin to pay down our revolver debt.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   The borrowing base under our senior security revolving facility, which was set in late March, remains unchanged at $275 million, and should remain there until our regularly scheduled fall redetermination process.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at Quarter End hold $168.6 million, and we had $1.8 million in cash. With $106.4 million of unused borrowing capacity, that gave us approximately $108 million of liquidity at Quarter End.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I would note that as of July 31st, we had paid down our revolver by $14.3 million compared to Quarter End, reducing our debt balance now to about $154.3 million, and we do expect to apply free cash flow the remainder of the year primarily to pay down the revolver.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   During the second quarter, our capital expenditures settled $3.2 million, and year to date, we have spent $45 million of our annual 2020 capital budget of $50 to $60 million.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   As Robert mentioned, we concluded our 2020 drilling program in May, so we anticipate minimal expenditures during the remainder of the year, and it will likely end up toward the low end of our guidance range.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Now looking at our second quarter income statement, starting with the top line, revenues for the second quarter of 2020 were $21.7 million compared to $45.1 million in the first quarter.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   The decline was driven by a 54% decrease in oil revenues to $18.9 million, which made up about 87% of total revenues, and the NGL revenues fell by 44%, while natural gas revenues rose slightly.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Our average price in the second quarter for all three commodities was $17.56 per barrel of oil equivalent, which was down by nearly half of our average price during the first quarter.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   By commodity, our average mileage price for crude oil in the second quarter was $23.56 per barrel, natural gas at average $0.83 per MCF, and NGL averages $8.10 per barrel of oil equivalent.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   From a production standpoint, our second quarter sales volumes averaged $13,555 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was comprised of 65% oil, 18% natural gas, and 17% natural gas liquids.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   As highlighted, this does include having curtailed about 60% of total production in May.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   On the expense side, as Robert also highlighted, we did drive down our all-in-cap costs from $12.92 per BOE in the first quarter to $10.11 per BOE in the second quarter.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   We achieved this through nearly $2 per BOE reduction, our least operating expense, to $4.52 per BOE for the quarter.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   On the general administrative side, we reduced our absolute cash GNA expense by about 7% versus the first quarter, which resulted in per unit cash GNA expense of $3.34 per BOE.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   As you know, we reduced our cash GNA guidance in May to $15.5 to $16.5 million for the full year, and expect to be somewhere in that range, which at the bottom end is a 25% reduction versus our initial full-year plan.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   In addition to some of the savings we articulated last quarter, we continue to focus on and have had success in reducing expenses, really any and everywhere, including reduced uses of third-party consultants, reducing vendor rates, and managing our costs tightly.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   From an income standpoint, we reported GAT net loss in the second quarter of $35.9 million, or $0.55 per share, which included a pre-taxed, unrealized loss of $50 million on our derivative contracts.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Our adjusted net income was $12.8 million or 20 cents per diluted share, adjustable diluted share for the second quarter.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   We reported adjusted EBITACs of $39.8 million in the second quarter, which as Robert mentioned, is actually an increased quarter of a quarter.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Now let's take a minute to update you on our commodity hedge results in the second quarter.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   As highlighted, we realized $29.4 million are gain on our commodity hedges for the quarter.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   This is largely reflective of our hedge position entering the quarter, and are locking in some really nice gains on hedges when we made the decision to Gretel production,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   and did that when second quarter and IMAX prices were about up to the lowest point.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   The hedge realizations also include a gain of about $5.7 million from an unwind of 1,000 barrels of oil a day for the second half of 2020.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   We remain really well ahead to the balance of the year with an average of 6,500 barrels per day of oil swapped at an IMAX price of $58.35.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Stepping down to 4,000 barrels a day for four year 2021 at an IMAX price of $55.16 per barrel, with basis hedges in place on similar volumes.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   On the natural gas side, we have 7,000 MMBTUs per day of swaps at a Henry Hub price of $2.85 for the second half of this year.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Stepping up to 8,000 MMBTUs per day at a price of $2.71 for four year 2021, with basis hedges in place on the same volumes.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Hedging remains a critical component of our financial strategy and we expect to continue layering on hedges as we get more visibility around the resumption of our drooling and completion activity going forward.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Stepping back and looking at our expectations for full year 2020, we reinstated our production guidance in July and we reinstated LLE in production and Avalorum tax guidance with our earnings released yesterday.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Our reinstated production Avalorum tax guidance of 6.25% to 7.25% is identical to what it was at the onset of our 2020 guidance provided in January, as is the case for our reinstated LLE guidance of $550 to $6 for BOE.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Although we have had recent sustainable LLE reductions and came in well below this range in the second quarter, without the advantage of bringing on new wells, we have kept our guidance range where it was at the beginning of the year when we anticipated bringing 16 new wells online.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   With that, I'll turn it back over to Robert.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Thank you Mark. We are really pleased with the results and confident in a bright future for Urgestone. While we are sorry to see our industry in such distress, it is creating more M&A opportunities than we have seen in quite some time.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   We are actively evaluating a number of situations and expect to have more to consider throughout the rest of the year as prices remain low and distress situations continue to increase.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   We believe that our strong balance sheet and track record as a successful consolidator positions us well to increase the scale of our company and add value to our shareholders.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   With that, Operator will now open the floor for questions.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press Start 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   You may press Start 2 if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Our first question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. I guess on the 2021 call that you gave about being able to keep production flat with the 11 ducks, is that more just meant to be instructive or is that actually how you're thinking about the 2021 plan as we fit here today?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Yes. A little bit of both, Brad. It does depend on where commodity prices head towards the end of the year, whether we want to pick up a rig or not.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I think we've been pretty vocal or consistent about our message that we need mid-45 to $50 oil to want to go back to spending large capital dollars.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   But outside of that, at some point into this year, early next year, completing those wells will allow us to main production flat year over year.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Okay, good. And then obviously you made the comment on M&A. Can you go into a little more detail about sort of what opportunities you're seeing and also any thoughts you have about an ability to fund them?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Opportunities are increasing and size is variable from small to quite large as you've seen, you know, distressed and bankrupt companies.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I think all of this will result in further opportunities in terms of larger companies selling assets.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   It is difficult with no public equity and, for that matter, debt markets open or open only to a very few.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Maybe we're one of those few, but we've had discussions with financial parties who are interested in participating with us on acquisitions.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And much like we've done in our history, you know, we'll bring in parties at the right time to look at buying assets and we're going to maintain a very healthy leverage amount and keep ourselves from getting into a distress no matter where we are in the cycle.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   So I think we're just going to see more and more opportunities and we'll figure out how we can finance those and make sure we keep our balance sheet clean.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Okay. Thanks for the comments.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Thank you. Our next question comes in line at Neil Dingman with Truist Security. Please proceed with your question.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Good morning all. Robert, first question also on that same line on 21 expectations and I'm just wondering, you know, why I realize this plan really, I think, you know, at least the one you just initial laid out assumes no new wells.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Really, what's wondering, what's driving this low cost or another way maybe ask is how you think about maintenance capex, you know, given just so low because, you know, if I recall, I thought Frank already had you all cancel all those country clubs and other memberships, I just know what else is there.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Yes, there's no country club memberships up here.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   You know, I mean, the 11 wells we have are in really good areas and they, they will help us keep production relatively flat at $30 million.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Now, is that sustainable? Absolutely not.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   You know, we still have a relatively high decline rate, and it does depend on when we brought those wells online. If we wait until the very end of 21, we're going to have a hard time keeping production relatively flat.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   If we brought them on today, you know, we might have the same problem because we get all this flush production from these new wells.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   So, you know, maintenance to maintain, you know, 13,000 BoE a day kind of level longer term, we're going to have to have a rig running and a one rig program.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   I don't know what it would exactly cost us today, but generally speaking is 120 million to maybe 140 million, depending on lateral length and working interest and things like that.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   So, you know, this is just a very preliminary. If the world stays the same and we're at 40ish low $40 environment, we're not spending any drilling capital.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   These 11 ducks will help us keep production flat.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Okay, and then you kind of hit on my last one just on how do you think about sort of PDP decline, you know, on a go forward. It is now that you've been slowing a bit, is that that too, you know, going to go down or I guess look at another way is that, you know, you're able to give us kind of how many wells would offset that.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I mean, in any way you can kind of give us a caller on how, you know, kind of you're thinking about that in 21 on broader terms.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Yeah, I think we've been consistent in telling everyone that our sort of basic line starting today, we'll call it, you know, is about 30% in the first year and then it gets into the mid to maybe 26 or 27% the next year and then low 20s or high teens after that.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And so, you know, I don't think that's changed any.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And if we didn't spend any capital then you can kind of forecast what our low down production would look like.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Even if we didn't do those 11 wells, but again with those 11 wells, it'll help keep 21 flat and then going forward in 22 and beyond.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   It's all going to depend on price.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Very good. Thanks.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jeff grant with Northland capital markets. Please proceed with your question.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   I guess I was wondering, Robert, or maybe some Mark, how important do you guys do you think pre cash flow positive in the context of evaluating, you know, whether to go after this deduction and potentially drilling or I guess some point in time, but would you view that as kind of a, you know, a must if you will,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   or would you guys having level of comfort with any, you know, near medium term outstanding could help, you know, if the returns were good and it would help kind of, you know, jumpstart a return to growth.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Sure. Maybe I'll try to answer that one and Robert can add on if he wants to, you know, we keep things pretty simple.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   At the end of the day, we feel like our responsibility is to make good individual decisions at the wellhead.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   And that's why we were quick to put the rig down and stop completing in March and April is because the economics didn't make a whole lot of sense then.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Do the ducks make sense right now? I mean, economically, you definitely could go complete the ducks right now and have pretty nice IRRs for the incremental cost to complete them.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   In terms of, are we so focused on quarter to quarter or year to year pre-cash flow that we won't outspend? No, we're not.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And from a practical matter, and we're just going to be pre-cashable positive this year and next year kind of irrespective of anything else that happens with prices if all we're doing is completing the ducks.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   At some point, you know, we do anticipate picking the rig back up and, you know, there's a bit of obviously a lag there between the cost you expend to drill in the complete wells versus the cash flow.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   You know, does that mean over the course of the year we're not pre-cashable positive? No, not necessarily.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   But we're not so fixated on checking that box every quarter.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   We want to make smart economic decisions at the wellhead that will flow into the bigger picture.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And having some outspend for some period of time, you know, we still think is supported by the economics.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   At the same time, you know, we're not ones just to go keep drilling and completing because we have hedges in place or for other reasons.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   We're just trying to be as good as we can of the individual decisions we're making at the wellhead.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Yeah, the only thing I'll add, Jeff, is I think we can run a one rig program with the level of production and cash flow we have today and be cash flow neutral on an annualized basis.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Obviously, there's a jump starting the program. We're going to be cash flow negative for a period of time, but I think longer term over a year time frame.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Again, depending on what the price is.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Sure. Understood. Appreciate those comments.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   My follow up, and you guys still have, you know, a decent amount of non-off exposure in the Permian.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Are you guys seeing any activity levels there and more on the land side?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Is there any traction or conversations on swapping any of that out to increase the operation exposure there?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Working on the trades, but people have been hunkered down in the bunker, you know, for quite some time now since, you know, at least March.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   And so nothing's moving very quickly there.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   We have no, we have not heard anything different from our partners in terms of activity in the near term being kind of the remainder of this year.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   So what we're going to talk about to see as we get closer to year end what their view might be for activity in 2021.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   All right.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Duncan McIntosh with Johnson Rice. Please receive your question.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Good morning, Robert.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Good morning.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Had a quick question over on the balance sheet. You know, y'all are doing a great job in the free cash.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   I'm wondering, you know, have you been in conversations with the banks as we head into the fall redetermination back in March?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   You know, we're early in getting it done in the spring, but, you know, back then it looked like things would be pretty dire again in the fall.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And it's not as bad here.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   And particularly with the line of sight, y'all have on the free cash kind of how any conversation with them to give you any indication as to what the fall redetermination could look like.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Sure. I mean, probably too early to, you know, certainly anything around numbers, but we do pretty rarely talk to banks and we do that normal course irrespective of the environment.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   You know, the one thing I can for us, we are expecting to decrease in the bar base and you know, obviously we're not drilling and completing new wells and hedges roll off.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   You know, fortunately, we feel like we've got enough ability to pay down debt to outpace that decrease.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And really, you know, we don't see any scenarios that we think are realistic that would be concerning in that regard.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Now, I will say, like, does the environment feel better now than it did three months ago? Absolutely.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And maybe some of that's the shock of seeing minus 37-dollar oil and, you know, teeing realizations for the months of April and May.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   At the end of the day, it's still not a very good price environment for companies in general.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And the banks, maybe they feel a little better because we're at $45 or $42 versus somewhere in the teens, but they still have a lot of issues to deal with.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And obviously, there's been a lot of EMP companies that have gone bankrupt and there's certainly more that will.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   And the banks still have their hands full and they're still working through all these situations.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Yeah, I think there is a lot of trepidation in the banks part in general.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   And yeah, I don't frankly see them letting up a whole bunch in the fall.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   No, that being said, that's a general statement.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Yeah, we've got one-time leverage and liquidity and generally are viewed as having done the right thing from a financial standpoint.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Our assets are better than many.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   We probably feel like we've got a pretty supportive bank group that is going to be reasonable and fair.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   And historically, that's been the case, but too early to circle a number.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   Thanks, Mark.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And then I guess just for my follow-up, you know, Robert, you gave some really good color in order to some pretty creative things to get LOE down in the second quarter.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   I know you talked about how it's going to come back up a little bit here in the back half of the year towards, you know, a more historical range.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   But, you know, any of those initiatives that you took, do you think that you could carry forward to kind of help mitigate that LOE creep?
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Definitely done.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   There's, you know, it's just a constant progression of a well's life cycle to adjust artificial list.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   A lot of our wells are on gas lift, so relatively expensive compressors.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Over time, that gets changed out to other lift methods, in some cases rod pump and other cases plunger lift, what have you.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   So we're continuing to work through that, and that will definitely help reduce LOE.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And then some of the things that, you know, we're fortunate in getting done in the quarter working with the utility company to get meters set and get ahead of the schedule there,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   or got moved up in the schedule from some good relationships.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   We ended up getting generators off of our payroll, and those are very, very expensive.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   So we didn't have a whole lot, but they still show up as a big expense.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   And some of these things we did in the second quarter are sustainable, and we'll continue doing the right things in the way we, you know, operate our business and continue to watch costs like a hawk.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   All right, thank you all very much, and congratulations on a strong quarter and a strong outlook.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Thanks, Doug.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you'd like to join the question queue, please press star one on your telephone keypad.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   The next question comes from a line of Noel Parks with Cocor and Palmer.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Hey, good morning.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I know.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   I, you know, I was thinking about having the buck inventory that, you know, where it works out that just completing those next year can help you keep production flat.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   That's, you know, that's a lot of really great flexibility you have there.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And I mean, was that just sort of a result of the timing of everything, you know, kind of fallen off the rails with COVID and Ulrich Russia?
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Or was that sort of part of the plan as you were just trying to, you know, continue the pivot to emphasis on free cash flow hitting it next year?
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Well, I'd love to tell you, Noel, that we have this great plan that no matter what happened in the world, oil going to 20 or sub 20, that we could keep production flat for three years running with various amounts of capital.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   If you go back and think about the beginning of the year and the call we had, you know, related to the fourth quarter earnings and full year, we had a one rig program.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   We're going to average for the entire year a tiny bit of free cash flow.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And those 11 wells would have been completed. I don't know if by now I can't remember, but pretty darn close.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   So I'd say it's a fallout of what's happened here and just being very conservative with our capital expenditures and cash and making sure that, you know, we come out of this down.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   This near term down cycle. We've been in a down cycle since 2014, but at least this recent piece of it that we, you know, we survived nicely through it and come out the other side and continue to find ways to consolidate and grow.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Great. Thanks.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   You know, just a housekeeping question, sorry if you touched on this earlier and I missed it. For the free cash flow calculation, if I looked at the numbers right, it looked like this is one of those periods where there is a pretty big delta between, I guess you'd say cash capex and, you know, sort of capex incurred in the quarter.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   And I was just wondering, for the free cash flow calculation going forward, there's just kind of which one of those is more important for us to use as we, you know, just try to model that.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   We always use accrued cash from a calculation standpoint because not all the bills necessarily have hit, but we know what generally they are. So, okay, it's in the presentation on the last page or something like that.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Okay. So, oh, and one other thing, and I just don't have a release in front of me, and as far as change in working capital, that's something also you would routinely include, well, include the impact of in a free cash calculation, or would you exclude that?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Yeah, so we don't include that, and I recognize there's, you know, multiple different ways to look at that. I mean, the way we've been approaching it is, okay, adjusted EBITAC is the best proxy for a really sort of cash flow for the period.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   We back out interest expense, and then we back out capital expenditures for activity during that period.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Now, when you're stopping or starting, there is going to be a bigger delta between calculating free cash flow the way we do versus if you're using a cash capex number.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   You know, the second quarter was very atypical from the standpoint of, here we're reporting $35 million of free cash flow, our debt balance went up, and the reason for that is because, and of course this is tied to the cash capex.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   It's just the time of the payments. We reduced the negative working capital deficit by about $50 million during the quarter.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Now we're to a point where that working capital deficit is pretty low, and probably won't fluctuate a whole bunch one way or the other until we pick activity back up.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   At which point you'd expect, as you start completions and drilling again, you start getting bills, but there's some lag between the activity and when you get the bills and when you pay them.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   So very typical quarter. As we mentioned, the press release, we had about $169 million of debt at quarter end, and the month of July we paid down a little more than $14 million.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   That's not the run rate, by the way. It's not $14 million quarter. That was high because of timing, but we do expect, I mean, really every month this year that we're paying down some debt without any big changes in the working capital status.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Great. Thanks a lot for the details. That's not for me.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Anderson for any final comments.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   We appreciate everybody joining us, and we'll continue to update as we need to, and we'll see you next quarter. Thanks.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Thank you.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   Good day and welcome to the Ferns second quarter 2020 financial results and corporate
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.420]   update conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. As a reminder today's
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.440]   conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce you, your host for today's conference,
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:27.600]   Alexander Furzee, head of investor relations at Ferns. Please go ahead.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.880]   Thank you, Charlotte. I'd like to welcome and thank you all for joining us today for
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.320]   Affimate second quarter 2020 financial results and operational progress conference call.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.960]   Before we begin, I would like to encourage everyone to go to the investor relations section
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.720]   of Affimate's website to find the earnings release and related financial tables. We also
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.960]   post the slides on our website that follow our discussion today. On the call today, we are
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.360]   joined by Dr. Idie Herz, our chief executive officer, Andreas Hartstrich, chief medical
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.120]   officer, Arne Chattelius, chief scientific officer, and Angus Smith, our new chief financial
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.600]   officer who joined us in July. We are also joined by Dr. Wolfgang Fischer, our chief operating
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.320]   officer, and Ms. Denise Miller, chief business officer. They will also be available for the
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.400]   Q&A session. Before we start, I will quickly go through the Safe Harbor statement. Today's
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.080]   discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements regarding future events. These
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.920]   statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this call. Except
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.960]   as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.640]   publicly or to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.360]   anticipated in the forward-looking statement, even if new information becomes available in
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.560]   results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in this statement, these various
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.960]   factors including but not limited to those identified under the section entitled risk
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.440]   factors and our filings with the SEC and those identified under the section entitled forward-looking
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   statements in the press release that we issued today and filed with the SEC. With that, I
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.320]   will turn the call over to Adi. Adi?
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.440]   Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   business update call. Today we have some updates to share with you on our operational progress
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.360]   as well as on our financial results. While we are still in the middle of a serious global
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.000]   health pandemic and a challenging economic downturn and aftermath, we are quite confident
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.680]   that the steps we are taking in advancing our science and moving our pipeline forward are
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.000]   beginning to yield data that demonstrate the long-term potential of our innovative approaches
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.240]   and products. COVID-19 continues to affect societies around the world and we hope that
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.440]   you and your families are well and safe. We are observing some impact by COVID-19 on the
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.880]   progress of our clinical studies. However, it's at last time we are taking great efforts to
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   minimize them. As a result, we have been able to continue our progress on the clinical studies
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:45.960]   of AFM13 in the referral TESA lymphoma and of AFM24 in each AFR positive tumors. And, which
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:55.800]   is very exciting for us, genetic dose, the first patient with RO729708, which, as you remember,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:04.640]   is the BCMA CT-68 in SNHL. We are also making good progress on our preclinical pipeline.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.320]   For our lead candidate AFM13, our study in patients who have relapsed or refractory peripheral
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.920]   TESA lymphoma in exhausted available standard of care treatments are now being treated with
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.400]   AFM13 as a single agent. We are executing according to our development timelines and, as previously
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:33.160]   stated, expect to complete the pre-determined interim analysis in mid-2021. We are also
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.880]   looking at options to enhance AFM13's efficacy beyond monotherapy. The first of these options
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:48.000]   is the combination with allergenic NK cells in a study that is conducted at the MD Anderson Cancer
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.560]   Institute and on IST. MD Anderson website now shows that the study is enrolling, but the
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   initiation is impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Texas. A first patient in the study
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:10.080]   is expected as soon as this situation improves. For AFM24, we disclosed that we have completed
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:18.360]   the first COVID of our dose escalation study without any dose limiting toxicity. And we
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.080]   are currently recruiting into the second dose COVID. We have all four planned sites active
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.360]   and recruiting. Following the completion of the dose escalation phase of the study, we
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.000]   have the option to enroll patients into tumor-specific expansion cohorts where we will look for single
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.400]   agent activity in a number of well-defined tumor types. In addition, we are planning to initiate
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.560]   combination studies with checkpoint inhibitors. And we will be providing updates as the program
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.400]   continues to make progress. We're very pleased with the continued progress in our collaboration
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.600]   with Genentech. Importantly, the phase one clinical study with the BCMA CT16A inertial
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:10.400]   engager is now enrolling patients. This achievement represents the third inertial engager to enter
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.280]   the clinic and trigger some milestone payment to us during the third quarter in an amount
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.640]   that we are not able to disclose. Last month, Angus Smith joined us as Chief Financial Officer.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.200]   Angus will introduce himself later and discuss our financial position and the flexibility
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.480]   provides us to continue to execute on our strategy and drive future growth of our company. During
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.920]   the annual general meeting of shareholders, which was held in August 4, we are happy to
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.640]   report that all proposed agenda items were approved. This includes the addition of Dr. Annalisa
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:58.200]   Jenkins and Harry Welton to the Supervisor Report as new members. Annalisa is a visionary leader
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.760]   who knows how to translate signs from bench to bedside. And Harry is an accomplished financial
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.440]   executive who will help drive value-creating strategies for the company. These additions
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.600]   to the Supervisor Report further strengthen the company's industry know-how, experience,
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:22.800]   and diversity. As it has only been a month and a half since we last spoke to you, we thought
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.520]   we would focus today's discussion on company achievements thus far and what gives us confidence
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.000]   in our science. Update you on our programs and allow plenty of time for Q&A. To get started,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.720]   I will now hand over the call to Andreas Horstreich, our Chief Medical Officer, to give you a brief
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.040]   update on our clinical stage programs. Andreas?
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yes. Thank you, Adi, for the introduction and thank you all for joining us today. And I'm
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.240]   happy to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs that we made over
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:07.760]   the last three months. As you all aware, COVID-19 pandemic is still present globally, and it
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:15.840]   continues to pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment of patients.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.320]   The two guiding principles we are employing at AFIMED is to ensure patient safety on the
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:29.640]   studies and to ensure trial data integrity. And this is in line, I think, with our guidances
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.080]   given from all competent authorities. Within this framework, however, the AFIMED team is
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:44.800]   very proactively working with all of our participating sites to make sure that our innovative treatment
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:52.640]   is still available for patients in need of new therapeutics and that we minimize the impact
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:09:00.080]   of COVID-19 to a minimum possible. One important achievement in this regard is that we were able
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.560]   to secure drug supply for all of our ongoing studies and can ensure uninterrupted treatment
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:14.880]   of all patients. To go into more detail, let's start with AFM 13, our most advanced program
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:25.520]   first. As you know, AFM 13 is in a registration directed phase two study, AFM 13202 treating
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:33.280]   patients with relapsed and refractory peripheral T cell lymphomas, who have exhausted all available
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:42.280]   standard of care options. The enrollment into this study is at a steady state. We were able
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:52.000]   to activate 54 sites now contributing patients in 10 countries around the globe. As you know,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.600]   this study has Simon two stage design with a pre-planned interim analysis after 40 patients
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:09.100]   in the PTCL cohorts. As Adi said, we are confident that we will have the data from this interim
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:15.840]   analysis available by the middle of next year. There was also a third cohort, or there is
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.800]   a third cohort in this study for patients with transformed mucosa fungoides, so a cutaneous
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.840]   form of T cell lymphomas. This third cohort with mucosa fungoides was never part and never
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:37.880]   intended to be part of the registration program. It was a proof of concept cohort only. And
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:45.640]   for COVID-19 related restrictions, the enrollment into this cohort is currently on hold. As Adi
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:51.160]   also mentioned, we are continuing to make progress in our collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:59.760]   Center where we have an active IND for our first phase one study of AFM 13 in combination
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:07.920]   with allergenic national killer cells. As Adi said, the current status at the MD Anderson
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:15.840]   web page is recruiting and we know that patients are currently screened and considered and we
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:22.080]   are expecting to the enrollment of the first patient as soon as COVID-19 related restrictions
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:32.080]   at MD Anderson are lift up. Now let's move to our second program AFM 24. As you know,
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.920]   my specific tetravalent molecule targeting both CD 16A to activate national killer cells
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:47.600]   and macrophages and the EGF receptor on solid tumors. This compound is in phase one, those
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:55.280]   escalation part of the 101 study. And we are happy to report that we were able to activate
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:02.720]   all four pre-planned sites and all four pre-planned sites are contributing patients. As we disclosed
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:09.080]   earlier, we have completed cohort one without observing those limiting toxicities and are
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:20.360]   actively recruiting into those cohort two. With this, I close the overview of the clinical
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:28.480]   progress and I'm happy to hand over to my colleague Arncho Tilios, chief scientific officer, who
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:35.640]   will review with you some of our preclinical data that make us so excited about the opportunities
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:42.480]   that we can create for patients with ICEs and activating the innate immune system. Arncho
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:49.960]   please. Thank you, Andreas, and thank you all for joining. In the next few minutes, I would
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:56.400]   like to summarize, as Andreas mentioned, the preclinical and clinical data observed so far
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:04.280]   with our innate cell engagers, providing evidence that these molecules are potent and safe drug
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:13.720]   candidates. I'll start by summarizing the data showing that our ICEs are potent molecules.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:22.760]   As you see on slide five, if we take AFM13 as an example, AFM13 has been shown strong single
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:31.680]   agent anti-tumor responses and T cell lymphoma with a normal response rate of 50%. The molecule
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.680]   has also shown promising signs of broad clinical development potential in augmenting other IO
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:46.160]   therapies such as PD1 inhibitors. For example, in the Hodgkin lymphoma phase 1B study, we've
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.280]   seen an impressive overall response rate of 88% with a complete response rate of 42% and
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:02.240]   46% in the local and the central read respectively. In the lower part of the slide, we've also
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:11.240]   highlighted four U presentations of the studies past and in the future. Additionally, our own
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:19.120]   experience and the work with Andy Anderson, we have seen promising preclinical data showing
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:25.120]   that the combination with the adoptive transfer of NK cells enhanced the immune response
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:32.640]   of AFM13 leading to prolonged survival in the respective mouse model. And as we mentioned,
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:40.880]   the phase 1B study of Andy Anderson is now in the last stages of preparation. If we go
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:49.080]   to slide six, you see that in our preclinical studies with AFM24, we saw potent killing
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:58.080]   of EGFR positive tumor cell lines mediated by two distinctive mechanisms of action. Potent
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:05.800]   ADCC or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity is seen irrespective of the imitational status
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:14.600]   of the tumor cells. And we see potent killing mediated by ADCP or antibody dependent cellular
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:22.960]   fibrocytosis in tumor cells with high and low EGFR expression. Importantly in cells bearing
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:34.920]   the KRAS G13D mutation, AFM24 shows preserved killing, potent killing, or ADCP or fibrocytosis,
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:46.340]   whereas this ability is lost for established treatments. For the anti-BCMA CD16 or RO729,
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:54.120]   formally known as AFM26 molecule, we also saw very good potency in synomunkies, whereas
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:03.720]   a dose dependent killing of BCMA positive plasma cells was observed. We believe that
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:11.040]   the observed improved potency is mediated by the dual mode of action of our approach.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:17.960]   The innate cell engagers are employing NK cells and macrophages to kill tumor cells and thus
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:25.680]   act via a two-pronged mode of action of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:33.320]   dependent fibrocytosis to fight cancer. Indeed, this dual mode of action is differentiated
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:42.360]   from other innate cell targeted approaches, as these specifically activate NK cells only.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:49.600]   Our innate cell engagers work at low expression levels. The potency is thus independent of
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:58.720]   the surface target expression. And you see this in Continuum Slide 6. With AFM13, we learned
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.960]   that there is a broad range of cell lines that express different levels of tumor antigen
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:12.400]   and we have not observed any dependency of target expression to the potency of the molecule.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.880]   The same holds true for AFM24 and the anti-BCMA engagers. Preclinically, both molecules have
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:28.660]   shown high potency across a wide range of EGFR and BCMA surface expression, including at low
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:36.200]   target expression levels. This implies that more patients could respond to treatment with
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:43.780]   an innate cell engager versus an antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, as the mechanism of
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:51.080]   ADCs have been shown, only to rely on certain levels of target antigen, thereby missing
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:18:00.440]   those tumor cells with expression levels below the ability of the ADC to bind to target cells.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:07.500]   As we move on to Slide 7 and report on the safety front, preclinically, our innate cell
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:15.600]   engagers demonstrate low cytokine release. Some examples of this are the IND-enabling
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:21.720]   toxicology study in synomologous monkeys, which consistently showed no meaningful increases
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:29.280]   in serum cytokines. For example, at the June virtual AACR conference, a preclinical poster
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:37.200]   presentation on the RO729 molecule with genetic showed potent cell killing in tumor cell lines
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:44.040]   employing NK cells as effector cells, with minimal increase in cytokines. Also, a four-week
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:50.760]   safety study in synomonkeys showed a favorable safety profile with no cytokine release
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:19:00.360]   or adverse findings at the 1515 and 5050 mixed per kick tested dose levels. And in the case
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:09.320]   of AFM-24, only a transient increase in RO6 was observed that was fully reversible within
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:15.880]   24 hours, but no signs of cytokine release was observed that would lead one to believe that
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:23.280]   there is a risk of a cytokine storm in patients. Important to note here is that none of the
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:30.720]   clinical studies of AFM-13 have revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:39.440]   These data indicate that our ICs have a tolerable and good safety profile. Taken altogether,
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:45.640]   these data suggest that our innate cell engages are potent, able to engage at low levels of
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:52.160]   antigen expression, and have thus far demonstrated a good and tolerable safety profile.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:59.400]   Now, in order to maximize the opportunity for our molecules, in addition to clinical development
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:05.920]   as monotherapies, we are also pursuing combinations with natural killer cells and other treatments
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:13.440]   such as checkpoint inhibitors such as PD1 and PDL1. We go to slide eight and first let me
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:20.600]   comment on our combination approach with NK cells. As you see on the slide, there is evidence
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:27.640]   showing that high NK cell numbers are associated with better outcomes. For example, patients
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:35.040]   with metastatic cutaneous melanoma have improved survival rates if their tumors show evidence
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:42.480]   of NK cell infiltration. We also know that patients with diffuse large B cell and follicular
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:51.920]   lymphomas treated with NDCD20 antibodies that have low peripheral NK counts tend to have
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:59.840]   poor survival. We are seeing that one of the limitations in treating patients is that they
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   don't have the appropriate amount of NK cells. So, we are working on supplementing NK cells
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:15.240]   through adaptive transfer and are currently assessing different approaches as you can see
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:24.160]   on slide nine. As we go to slide 10, and as discussed earlier, the improved tumor cell
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:31.960]   killing by loading NK cells with our ICEs, as you see on the graph for in vitro data on
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.440]   the right-hand side of slide 10, it will be investigated in the MD Anderson phase one
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:45.560]   study in CD30 positive recurrent or refractory Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:51.200]   preclinical data that we share here, and have shared before, leads us to believe that we
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:59.760]   can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy of innate cell engager AFM13 through the addition
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:10.240]   of NK cells. Encouraged by the synergistic potential of combining our ICEs with NK cells
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.880]   and checkpoint inhibitors, we're currently evaluating the opportunity on our developing clinical
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:24.960]   plans for these combinations with AFM24. Finally, let me just briefly summarize the recent posters
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:32.520]   presented at ASCR. As a reminder, our AFM24 poster demonstrated its distinct mechanism
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:40.880]   of action, different from other EGFR signaling inhibition approaches, potentially able to
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:47.680]   provide benefit to a broad range of cancer patients. And in the case of the joint poster
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:55.840]   with genetic, the preclinical pharmacology and safety of the BCMA CD60NA innate cell engager
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:02.720]   shows potent cell killing in tumor cell lines, employing NK cells as effector cells, minimal
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:10.200]   increase in cytokines, suggesting a low risk of cytokine release syndrome. We hope this
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:16.160]   background was helpful for you, and I will now turn the call over to Angus to introduce
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.440]   himself and provide an update on the financials. Angus.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.440]   Thank you, Angus.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.440]   Thank you, Angus.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440]   Thank you, Angus.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.960]   Before I discuss our financial highlights, let me just say that I am thrilled to have joined
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   that event.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.160]   And I look forward to working with our challenge team to deliver on the promise of our exciting
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   site.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.800]   Turning to the results for the quarter, APIMED's consolidated financial statements have been
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.720]   prepared in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:55.520]   for IASB. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the company's
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:01.720]   functional and presentation currency. Therefore, all financial numbers that I will present in
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:07.160]   this call unless otherwise noted, will be in euros.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.520]   We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalence, and current financial assets
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:20.480]   of 92.6 million euros compared to 104.1 million euros on December 31, 2019.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.040]   During the quarter, we received net proceeds of approximately 20.8 million euros under
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.000]   our asset market for ATM program.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.440]   Based on our current operating plan and assumptions, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalence,
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.920]   and current financial assets will support operations into the first half of 2022.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.720]   Net cash used in operating activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 with 15 million
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.880]   euros compared to 5.6 million euros in the second quarter of 2019.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.600]   The second quarter, 2019 net cash used in operating activities included a milestone
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.400]   payment to the company from the Genentech collaboration.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.360]   Federal revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was 2.9 million euros compared with 4 million
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:14.920]   euros in the second quarter of 2019. Revenue in 2020 and 2019 predominantly relates to the
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:20.440]   Genentech collaboration. Revenue from the Genentech collaboration in the second quarter, 2020 was
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:27.840]   comprised of revenue recognized for collaborative research services performed during the quarter.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.920]   The expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 11.7 million euros compared to 11.5 million
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:40.600]   euros in the second quarter of 2019. Expenses in 2020 relate predominantly to our AFM-13
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:48.240]   and AFM-24 clinical programs as well as to our early-stage development and discovery activities.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.960]   G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 2.6 million euros compared to 2.3 million
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:00.360]   euros in the second quarter of 2019. Increase is primarily related to higher SOC compliance
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:07.360]   costs, legal consulting and audit costs. Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was 12.2
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:14.560]   million euros or 16 cents per common share of 10.3 million euros or 17 cents per common
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:20.440]   share during the second quarter of 2019. The weighted number of common shares outstanding
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:26.960]   for the quarter ended June 30th, 2020, were 79.2 million. I will now turn the call back
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:37.720]   to Adi. Adi? Thank you, Angus. As you can see from our presentation today, we're taking
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:44.240]   advantage of the knowledge that we've gained in the field of innate immunity and are applying
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:52.420]   it to our programs going forward. This experience in working with the innate immune system is
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:59.080]   something that we have uniquely established at AFMET and is helping us in guiding the design
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   of unique therapies, which now have the potential to address very different kinds of cancers.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:14.480]   I just want to point out here that the EGFR is expressed in more than 10 tumors, and that
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:23.520]   gives us a lot of optionality how to take this molecule forward. We're pleased with how
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.120]   things are moving forward for both our clinical and preclinical programs, especially in the
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:36.360]   current environment. Our preclinical programs are on track from 13 and 24 are moving forward
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:42.800]   according to plan, and Gen Ante is moving things forward with the anti-PCMA CD16A inertial
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:51.720]   engagement. What are our inflection points for the next one and a half years? For AFM 13,
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:59.160]   we've mentioned that we want to present the interim data in peripheral T cell lymphoma
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:07.760]   around middle of next year. We've been successful in our collaboration with MD Anderson, moving
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:17.040]   forward the combination of AFM 13 and co-plug derived natural killer cells. As we said, we're
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:21.640]   ready to start. Our MD Anderson is ready to start, and we hope to report first patient
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:29.620]   then, and we will provide updates as we move forward. For AFM 24, we're in the midst of
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:37.080]   dose escalation in order to generate safety and activity data. This is quite exciting for
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:46.040]   us because it's a drug with a very differentiated profile as compared to the other moieties currently
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:54.840]   used in targeting EGF receptor. Now, with the dose escalation and establishing the safety,
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.920]   we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:06.000]   dose cohort expansion, but as we've mentioned earlier, we're also planning early on to
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:15.040]   move forward into combinations. We're very happy with the progress in the Gen Ante collaboration.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.360]   We've just provided the next update for the BCMA CD16A engager. We have multiple other
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:27.600]   programs ongoing, and if things go well, pending on program progression, we can bring in additional
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:38.560]   milestone. For our newest additions to the pipeline with AFM 28 and AFM 32, we're starting
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:46.680]   behind enabling studies so that we can have an ID filing first for AFM 28. Finally, before
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.880]   we open the session for Q&A, I would like to thank all our employees for their contribution
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:57.540]   and express our gratitude, my gratitude, in particular for our investigators and the clinical
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:03.920]   sites, the patients and all their families and our investors who are supporting us in
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:11.480]   our efforts to develop these innovative treatments for cancer patients. It is through the combined
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   efforts of all of you that keeps us on the path of discovery and innovation. I'm now happy
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.840]   to close the presentation, and we're open now for questions. Thank you.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:29.040]   Please and y'all may now begin the question and answer session. As a reminder, you should
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:34.160]   remember that if you wish to ask a question, you will need to press star and the number
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.620]   one on the telephone ring for an interview. If you wish to cancel it, you can press the
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:43.420]   pound or hash key. Once again, it's star and one for a question. First question comes from
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:49.180]   the line of Maui Rakoff from Jeffery. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:56.480]   Hi. Good morning, everyone. That's under progress, and thanks for taking my questions. To start
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:02.000]   off, just wondering for AFM 24, I'm not sure how much you can say on this, but just wondering
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.640]   if both patients in core two have been dosed, and if you can talk more about the timing of
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.680]   dosing between patients, and what the foresight's activated, can you provide any more perspective
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:20.920]   about enrollment pace going forward? Andreas, can you take the question, please?
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:28.020]   Yeah. So there were multiple parts to the questions. I hope I got them all. So the phase one study
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:36.480]   of AFM 24, as we said, we are recruiting in the second cohort. We have not yet disclosed
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:45.560]   how many patients. As you know, it's a standard three by three design, which was a Bayesian
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:54.360]   dose modification, but that's basically what it is. In terms of timing between the patients,
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:01.280]   there is a mandatory eight-day waiting period between patients, so they cannot be treated
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:07.920]   all at the same time, but will be staggered with eight-day intervals. And there was another
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.520]   part of the question around the four participating sites.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:18.560]   Right. Yeah. Just wondering if you can provide any more perspective about enrollment pace
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:26.560]   going forward? Yeah. Currently, the enrollment pace is as pre-spressified by the protocol.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:32.960]   Also, all sites are very active in screening patients. And as we said, all sites have already
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:42.360]   contributed patients. Got it. Okay. Great. And then also for AFM 24,
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:48.200]   just checking if you can say more about the tumor types that you're screening for the study.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.040]   And if you can also provide more perspective into the checkpoint inhibitor and combo plans
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:33:04.920]   at this point. So for the tumor types in the dose escalation part, we are accepting all
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:14.080]   our patients with all histologies that are EGFR expressing and where the patient has exhausted
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:21.080]   the respective standard of care treatments. As Adi mentioned, this is a wide variety of potential
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:27.600]   tumors. Probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal cancer and non-small
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:34.360]   saline cancer. And these are the two histologies where we would expect probably the majority
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:41.920]   of patients in the phase one having said that the dose escalation part would also be open
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:49.000]   for other EGFR expressing tumors like, for example, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.760]   or other solid tumors. Now, once we have defined our dose limiting
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:00.080]   toxicities or if there are no dose limiting toxicities, we have defined the recommended
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:09.440]   phase two dose. We will enroll into tumor specific expansion cohorts. And these expansion cohorts
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:19.240]   are currently in the process of being defined. Now, for our PD1 combination plans, based on
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:26.120]   the interesting data we have seen with PD1 in combination with AFM13, which aren't referred
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:35.880]   to, was a very encouraging complete response rate in excess of 40%. We plan to have a combination
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:46.560]   with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor open rather soon, probably in parallel to the last cohorts of
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.960]   the dose escalation of the single agent study. So it will be more or less a parallel development
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:35:06.880]   that we are anticipating right now. Great. Okay. Thanks for the additional perspective.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:15.600]   Any follow-up questions? We'll now proceed to the next question. Next question comes from
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:22.080]   the line of Jim Bertchenoff from West Fargo. Please go ahead, Jim.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:29.000]   Hi, guys. Congrats on all the progress. Maybe just a first quick question for Angus to start
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.240]   him off. Collaborative research revenues, is that expected to be a stable number between
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:42.760]   the three to $4 million level or is there any reason that might go up as programs progress?
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:48.020]   And as we think about the milestone that got paid in the third quarter, is it a simple matter
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:52.600]   to back out the assumptions around collaborative research revenues, and that will give us some
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.680]   sense of the milestone that you can't say it explicitly?
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Jim, for the question. So, you know, our revenue numbers fluctuate
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:07.200]   from quarter to quarter, you know, based primarily on the number of hours that we're working on
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.120]   and the various Genentech programs that are in progress. I mean, you can see just looking
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:19.240]   back at the last several quarters, we've been, you know, fairly range bound and call it the
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:24.600]   $2 million to $5 million zone. You know, when you see increases, it's typically a result
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.720]   of point in time milestone payments that we receive. So, you know, this milestone payment
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:36.360]   that we discussed today that we'll celebrate in the third quarter will likely increase
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.840]   our revenues in the third quarter. And that would be sort of an add on to the range you've
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:46.040]   seen over the last several quarters have met, again, kind of to the $2 to $5 million, or
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:53.280]   $2 to $5 million euros rather. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on cohort
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:37:00.320]   one for AFM 24 and what we might learn from that cohort, can you remind us if you're doing
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:06.080]   pre and post biopsies and what kind of translational work you might be doing and, you know, how
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:12.280]   that might inform, you know, the ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site?
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:22.960]   Yeah. So, in the dose escalation part, we do a pre-treatment biopsy, post or on-treatment
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:32.200]   biopsies are optional. We do have a significant correlative science program looking at peripheral
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:39.440]   activation markers of NK cells as well as on cytokine profiles. Once we are in the expansion
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:46.800]   phase, so we are recruiting into tumor-specific cohorts. I think this is the part where we
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.640]   will get most of the correlative science as we have a more homogeneous patient population.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:38:00.080]   We maintain our requirement for a pre-treatment biopsy and will have post or on-treatment
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:07.640]   biopsies in selected cohorts. And then just, you know, given the comments
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:18.480]   on the variability in peripheral NK cell populations, is there any sense in screening patients for
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:24.640]   their NK cell levels, given that, you know, patients who screen low may not have adequate
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:32.240]   NK cells or macrophages to recruit or you feel like within the variability of innate cell
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.320]   in the blood that you'll be able to have an effective treatment and it's not worth screening
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:42.480]   for that variable? I think currently it would be premature
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:50.520]   to, yeah, depends on what you mean with screening. So, we are definitely determining the levels
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:57.520]   of circulating NK cells and also looking at some of their characteristics. I think we
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:04.600]   currently do not have enough data to define a cutoff or a threshold. And this may very
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:12.080]   well vary between tumor histologies and also be dependent on the infiltration of NK cells
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:20.480]   in the tumor microenvironment variable, which we have seen in our AFM Columbia study to have
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:28.200]   some impact on the likelihood to respond to patients. So, I think in the beginning of the
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:34.840]   program, we will be open for all comers. We will assess all of these important biomarkers
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:40.280]   and then based on the activity data and the readouts that we are seeing, we may modify
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.600]   as a program defining certain thresholds, but currently I think it would be premature
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.600]   to do that. And maybe just a final question, just the
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:56.840]   Andy Anderson collaboration is focused on cord blood derived NK cells. Is there any
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:07.640]   thought to other NK cell sources, including potentially IPSC derived NK cells?
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:16.240]   Adi, you want to take the question or should I take it?
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   No, well, Andreas, why don't you go ahead?
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:24.760]   Okay. Yeah, you're right. Cord blood derived NK cells is one source of NK cells. And if
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:35.800]   you watch the field of NK cell based approaches, especially the field around companies and
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   institutes are providing different sources of NK cells, there is definitely speed picking
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:50.360]   up and then there is a variety of options to look at. And this is what we do not only
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:41:01.080]   from our side, but we have also received proactive inquiries of potential working models together.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:08.040]   So we are looking at the entire NK cell field and then evaluate various options there.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.000]   Great. Thanks for taking the question, Zeiss.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.880]   Maybe as a quick comment, we see this cord blood derived NK cells already quite advanced
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.440]   in clinical development. So there have already been many patients treated while with the
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:31.680]   IPSCs currently, there is still a safety to be determined and obviously in combination
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:39.720]   we will learn more on the functionalities. So this is somewhat yet to us on how functional
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:45.120]   an IPSC derived versus a peripheral NK cell is and it's good to see the first clinical
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:51.400]   data. So we're quite not only happy, but we've checked so many different options at the moment
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:56.480]   for NK cells and we are indeed very convinced about the activity of the cord blood derived
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:02.040]   cells from MDN. Great. Thanks, Adi.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:11.760]   Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of IOG from BMO Capital. The line is now open.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:17.160]   Please go ahead. Hey, good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:25.080]   my question. This is E.K. on for Do Kim. Just a couple regarding the BCMA and the Engager.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:33.560]   I understand that you have limited visibility on the entirety of the clinical bill pathway,
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:41.000]   but if you can provide any type of insight in terms of what genetic kind of has planned
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:53.040]   in terms of today potentially pursue an accelerated pathway for the assets and secondly, again,
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:59.440]   you don't provide complete details on the exact milestone payments, but if you can provide
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:07.080]   it some additional perspective on what the future milestones for the asset might hold
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:14.360]   in terms of, you know, phase two, phase three, things of that sort, as you would expect, increasing
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:20.240]   size of value for each milestone payments, that would be helpful for us. Thanks.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:27.280]   Adi, maybe I take the question on the pathway and then hand over to you with the milestones.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:34.040]   Yes, please go ahead, Arndt. So thanks for the question. I mean, as you already correctly
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:40.520]   say, we cannot really speak in detail for Genentech, but we can share with you. I think you're aware
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:47.160]   of course, licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal. We did with Genentech. They're
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:54.680]   obviously excited about the strong differentiation potential of the molecule also demonstrated
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:01.400]   at ACR at the poster just to review again, a very strong preclinical cell killing selective
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:08.280]   nosauticon release, very good safety profile, and good pharmacodynamic marker, specific
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:17.320]   BCMA plasma cell killing in the synomunky. So, you know, despite the also recent approvals
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:26.760]   of the, you know, first encumbers in the space, I would say that Genentech shares our excitement
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:32.080]   with the differentiation potential in a way for a potentially best-in-class molecule. Maybe
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:42.040]   I leave it there. I think it's a clearly strongly clinically validated space, and I think this
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:49.320]   molecule will enable Genentech and we as their partner to, you know, have a strong position
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   in this space.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:59.080]   Regarding the financials, I just want to recall the deal when it was signed. So, we received
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:09.240]   96 million in upfront cash, and I can get the total of more than 5 billion in milestones
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:15.160]   that are in different categories. So, there are preclinical, there's a preclinical milestone
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:21.880]   payment. There are indeed multiple clinical milestone payments, regulatory and cells
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:29.680]   milestones, and on top we can receive royalties, which as we described are on the higher end
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:39.120]   of what you would expect for the early nature of the license agreement. Beyond that, we're
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:46.760]   unable to disclose any further details unless Genentech would allow us or Rush would allow
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:54.200]   us to do so. Usually, and that's just a general statement, is that the payments will increase
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.560]   the further the program progresses.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:03.120]   Okay, thank you for that. Just one more quick question. I think I might have misheard it.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:10.920]   This is in regards to AFM 24. I believe you mentioned that there was a patient that had
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:18.200]   increased in AL6 cytokine levels that was resolved over 24 hours. I'm just curious,
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:23.600]   was that self-resolving or did that patient receive an AL6 inhibitor?
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:30.800]   Yeah, I can -- thanks for bringing that up and clarifications. So, the transient AL6 increase
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:39.400]   was reported in the INE enabling synotox study, what you referred to the ASDR poster. Indeed,
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:46.000]   we saw that with the dosing, a kind of moderate peak that quickly went down was completely
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.520]   resolved without any treatment. Obviously, one doesn't do that in the -- because this
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:57.560]   is synotox study. Again, when we see this in the context, because it was transient and
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:02.960]   fully reversed, leads us to the conclusion, which of course will be looked at carefully
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:10.200]   in patients that we should not expect any kind of cytokine release syndrome.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.160]   Okay, thank you for that clarification.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.160]   Sure.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:22.520]   Thank you. Next question comes from Yael Jenner from Made in Your Company. Please go ahead,
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.600]   Yael Jenner is now open.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   Hello.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:31.240]   Yes, hello. Yael, hi. Can hear you?
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:37.520]   Hi. Sorry, that's my hesitate to follow up. Thanks for taking the questions. My first
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:46.160]   question is that for the AFM 13 in the -- for the registration study that the -- it's assignment
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:56.480]   two set up. So, what might be the threshold of ORR in the 40 patients and sort of internal
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:02.440]   readout before you can move forward? So, just curious what -- any information you can reveal
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.320]   on that front?
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:13.520]   I'm afraid we cannot give a concrete response rate. It's based also on the Bayesian design,
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.960]   so there are some interdependence of response rates, but we usually do not disclose thresholds.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.720]   But it's a classical assignment two-stage design.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.280]   Okay, no problem.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:35.760]   And also just curious in terms of AFM 24 that your dose escalating, but at least based on
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:43.280]   the animal data, is any thoughts where -- when you might start to see the potential effective
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.600]   dose to start?
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:53.640]   I think currently it's not possible to predict when we will have the optimal biologically
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:49:01.480]   active dose, as there are a number of covariance like binding sites for CD16, binding sites
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:09.920]   for EGFR, and then distribution. And as you know, the animal models, especially in terms
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:18.400]   of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, are very difficult to translate the relevant
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:24.960]   talk species. And we have to add that only talk species is the synomorgous monkey. However,
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:32.360]   we do not have any synomorgous monkey tumor models available. So, we cannot really bridge
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:38.640]   between what we see in the toxicology studies and then what we would see in terms of efficacy
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:45.840]   for tumors. So, it will be something that we will have to define in our clinical program.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:55.360]   Okay, great. Maybe I will stick in one last question here, is that in terms of adaptive
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:03.560]   in case cell from the cobala, not deriving case cells, first of all, could that be potentially
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:11.160]   used in started tumor and any comments, comments in terms of regarding that possibility?
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:21.280]   This is, as Adi said, something that we are actively looking into. We are starting out
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:31.800]   with lymphomas, obviously, with AFM13 targeting CD30. But our vision is that also for AFM24
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:39.960]   we will develop certain development options in combination with NK cells. Could be cord
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:45.600]   blood derived NK cells. Could be NK cells from another source. That is something that
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:53.400]   we will define. But the intention is also to have a program where AFM24 would be partnered
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:51:13.360]   with exogenous NK cells. Okay, great. Thanks. Appreciate it. And congrats for all the progress
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:23.320]   this far. Yeah, thank you again for listening in and following our updates.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:31.880]   The program is coming smoothly along despite that we are affected by COVID. We have strengthened
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:37.600]   the team significantly in order to address any issues that may relate to the conductance
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:46.560]   of this clinical trials or to the interactions with the specific sites. So we're very happy
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:53.160]   to be able to have been able to address any of the issues that have been arising in the
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:59.680]   field. Indeed, I want to thank again the entire team here at AFIMED for managing all that through
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:07.760]   these difficult times. We're quite excited that we can move forward these programs either
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:14.720]   as monotherapies and now looking at different options of combination. If you have heard,
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:20.320]   we focus on natural killer cells and checkpoint inhibitors, in particular PD1s or PDO1s. So
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:26.800]   we feel that we have with the multiple programs addressing different targets, we can provide
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:35.640]   a cadence of data over the next quarters and in years. And very happy to report any additional
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:41.040]   updates as we move along. Thanks a lot again for listening in and all the best. Good point.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:45.060]   Thank you. That is the end of the conference for today. Thank you all for participating
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:55.400]   in the August Connect. See you soon everyone. Thank you.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.600]   Good morning and welcome to the third quarter 2020 pilgrim's pride earnings conference call
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.800]   and webcast. All participants will be in listen only mode.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.000]   Do you need assistance? Please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key font by
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   zero. At the company's request, this call is being recorded.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Please note that the slides we saw during today's call are available for download
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   from the investor relations section of the company's website at www.pilgrims.com.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   After today's presentation, there will be the opportunity to ask questions.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I would now like to turn the conference over to Dana Muinoto,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   how the investor relations for pilgrim's pride. Please go ahead sir.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Good morning and thank you for joining us today as we are operating in financial results for the third quarter end of September 27, 2020.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release providing an overview of our financial performance for the quarter,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   including a reconciliation of any non-gap measures we may discuss.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   The copy of the release is available in the investor relations section of our website,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   along with the slides we will reference during this call.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   These items have also been filed as aid case and are available online at www.scc.gov.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Presenting to you today our Fabio Sandri, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Mention Officer, Angel Walbooser at Commodity Risk Management.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone of our safe harbor disclaimer.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements that represent our outlook
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   and current expectations as of the day of this release.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Other additional factors none anticipated by management may cause actual results
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   to defer materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Very information considering those factors has been provided in today's press release
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   on NK and our regular filings with the SEC.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I'd now like to turn the call over to Fabio Sandri.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Thank you Dana. Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us today.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   For the third quarter of 2020, we reported net revenues of $3.08 billion
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   and adjusted EBITDA of $305 million or a 9.9% margin, 18% higher than a year ago
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and an adjusted GAMP EPS of 66 cents.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our global team for their continuing commitment,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   dedication and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and healthy
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   by maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging time.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I could not be more proud of our team as they have continued to come together
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   to support one another, our customers and consumers.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   FACE is a conditional appearance and our team members responded admirably
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   to the unprecedented conditions supplying products to our customers.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   We are continuously adapting our global operations to the change in channel demand
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   while adjusting our operations to be able to maintain the operations at all our plans
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   and minimize any significant disruption due to labor and health issues.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   We remain diligent in implementing precautionary, proactive steps
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   to better safeguard the wellness and health of each team member
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   while fulfilling our spatial duty as a food producer to consumers in every region where we operate.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   We incurred direct COVID-19 mitigation costs of roughly $27 million for the quarter
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and close to $77 million year to date.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   The direct costs are related to the extra cleaning of our production and common areas,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   the extra PPE and the including masks and face shoes that we are providing to all of our team members
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and the installation of physical barriers in our production areas.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   We also installed dual technology UV and bipolar ionization in every plant
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   We are offering free light health online services that allow for virtual doctor visits
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   and no cost and above all CDC guidelines.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   We remove vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   These figures includes indirect costs.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   There are a lot of indirect costs that are more difficult to precisely quantify
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   such as overall disruptions to our operations, less optimal mix and production efficiencies
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   that are not included in these numbers.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Also, we are supporting our communities with our HomeStrong initiative.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It is an example of how we value the important role we play in the communities where our team members live and work.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   We understand the responsibility that comes with being a major employer in rural communities
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and we work hard to contribute to the well-being of those communities
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   by not only providing gainful employment opportunities,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   but also participating in volunteers, donations and sponsorship opportunities.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   In this quarter, we accrued $50 million in SG&A for this initiative.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   According to the specifics of our business, despite continuing volatility and challenging market environments in Q3
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and added operating costs, we have continued to generate a superior relative performance to the competition
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   and have remained resilient to market fluctuations.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   This is a reflection of our portfolio approach including the strategy on well-diversified products,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   broad geographical footprints and relentless focus on key customers.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   For the full quarter, operating performance, both in US and Mexico, significantly improved sequentially
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and Europe also continued to increase despite the challenges due to COVID-19.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   In Q3, we saw market conditions continue to recover across all of our global operations
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   with the US and particularly Mexico experiencing the struggle rebound in performance
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   relative to weak conditions during the first half of the year.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   We are pleased with the results especially when taking into account all the disruptions,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   less than optimal product mix and added operating costs when compared to the environment in 2019.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Despite continuing challenges in global market conditions due to COVID-19,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   our consolidated results have also remained well balanced
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and the result of our vision to become the best and most respected company
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   creating the opportunity for a better future for our team members.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   To support our vision, we are continuing to implement our strategy of developing
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   a unique portfolio of diverse, complementary business models.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Continuing to relentlessly pursue operational excellence
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   becoming a more valid partner with key customers
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   and creating an informed environment for safe people, safe products and healthy attitudes.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   While market conditions in all our global operations are continuing to improve during the quarter,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   food service demand globally still has not reached prior levels
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and the environments are still quite challenging some sectors where we operate.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Disruptions from COVID-19 have continued to present a significant challenge
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   on each individual country's demand for protein consumption as well as for the flow of global trades
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   and generate volatility far beyond normal seasonal factors.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   We will maintain our strategy while continuing to improve the portfolio
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   to better respond to individual market dynamics
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   and generate a relative increase in performance over our peers.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   We believe this approach will give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to long run
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   and minimize the full peaks and troughs of the commodity sectors.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   During the third quarter in the U.S., we are continuing to see demand recover
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   at our fresh operations including from some sectors within food service
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   with more states gradually losing travel and movement restrictions.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   QSL volume has been especially strong and demand from our customers has been outperforming the industry.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Similar to last quarter commodity large bird reboning was also again the most challenged during Q3.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Operationally, however, we continue to improve our relative performance
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   versus the industry across all business units.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   We are continuing to adapt to the shipping channel demand by increasing our volume mix
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   to key customer retailers. In addition, a large portion of our food service customers
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   are also within the QSL segment which has further dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Our portfolio of differentiated products along with our key customer model
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   are giving us better insulation against the volatility.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   We are also in a much better position to adjust products and channel mix
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   given our presence across all bird sizes from small to large.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Within those small birds and case ready segments,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   market supply and demand was again very well balanced during Q3.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Demand from retailers, especially from our key customers,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   was strong supporting improved performance of our case ready business.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Our market leadership in these categories and more differentiated product portfolio
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   have continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive advantage versus the industry.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   While we commit to our key customer strategy has been reflected in the consistency for past results,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   the value of this approach has never been more relevant to our growth
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   than during the current times of great uncertainties and challenges.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   To further support the growth of key customers,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   we are doubling our case ready capacity at our plant in Minnesota
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   by increasing the number of heads processed at the plant
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   while also raising the mix of more stable margin case ready products.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   With this addition, we also expect to increase by 20%
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   our production of our differentiated higher attributes just bear brand products.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   It is also supported our conversion of one plant from the commoditized large bird deboning
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   to a key customer QSR in the small bird segment.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   The strong relationships we have with key customers
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   since these customer rely on us to satisfy their needs for growth.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   In addition, many of our key customers
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   maintain a leadership position in their respective categories.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   As a result, we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Beyond driving peer growth, our key customer strategy also promotes trust,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   enhances long term relationships and strengthens our margin structure.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   In the US prepare foods business, revenue declined 23% on 26% less volume year over year.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   A large part of this decrease, 70% of the volume was driven by schools remaining close,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   partially upset by strength in the retail demand.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   On the other hand, our margin from sales have improved 29%
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   driven by more favorable price and mix.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   We continue to simplify our portfolio to improve efficiencies
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   and shift resources towards branded growth in the retail channel.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Our pilgrims brand sales grew 52% and our just bear brand gained a new distribution
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   resulting in dollar share growth in the retail channel.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   32 code storage data, at the end of August, broiler inventory was up 2% from the close of Q2,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   but down 1% from the previous year.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Like quarter inventories were up 10% compared to last year.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   This is not surprising considering the mixed simplification
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   due to ongoing labor constraints seen during Q3,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   an overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result of COVID-19.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   As some markets reopen and the pipelines are empty,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   we are seeing some increasing leg quarter sales during October
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   and a reduction in inventories and upward movement in prices.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   US poultry exports, including pause, were up 4.7% year over year throughout August.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Roller meat alone was up 3%. In contrast, through Q3,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   our exports have increased by 14% year over year, outpacing the market.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   China continues to be a significant growth driver
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   and we believe the impact of AFS in Southeast Asia and now Germany
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   can provide further support to export demand.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   As we approach the one year anniversary of China reopening to US poultry,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   producers are presented with a vastly different market landscape than a year ago.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   China has solidified itself as one of the largest export destinations for poultry,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   second only to Mexico. China's presence as a significant buyer
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   keeps diversification of our export portfolio a high priority.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   We have added 95 new direct clients in 2020
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and have also continued to diversify our product and destination mix.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Sales of non-traditional export items are up 30% year over year,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   which strengthen the cutout margin.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   We enter Q4 with Optimus as we continue to place commodity items efficiently,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   leverage pigments overall portfolio diversity
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   and prioritize exceptional customer service to meet the needs of our key customers around the world.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   After a very challenging first half in 2020,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   our Mexican operations deliver great results in Q3
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and we recorded one of the strongest Q3 in the company's history,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   despite the favorable mix impacted and added operation costs relative to the same period last year.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   More normalized economic activities and improved supply demand balance in the market
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   are increased share of non commodity products
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   and a very good operational performance all contribute to the results.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Although overall demand is improving, we remain agile
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   and are continuing to adapt our facilities by shifting production to those channels
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   that are experienced better relative to demand.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   The persons in Mexico experience some challenges,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   especially in the value categories due to less traffic on retail
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   combined with a contraction in the QSR volume,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   but he begins to see some signs of improvements towards the end of the quarter
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and we believe the positive trend can be sustained into Q4.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   We remain committed in long-term growth and demand prospects in Mexico.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   We are continuing to invest in our ODEA and premium pilgrims brand
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   both in fresh and in prepared,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   as well as seeing more market share in the modern channel,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   which will bring more stable margins to our operations.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Our European chicken operations deliver a nibbit in Q3
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   that was 13% sequentially above Q2,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   with both volumes and revenues 7% and 18% higher respectively.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Supported by our exposure to retail
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   and the continuous recovery in food service and QSR demand in particular.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Relative to Q3 of 2019,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   EBITZ will still hire 2% despite 8% lower volume and 5% lower revenue.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   From easing of COVID-19 restrictions,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   the introduction of UK government incentive directs towards food service,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   as well as a consistent improvement in food service demand
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   within continental Europe,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   have all contributed to a better sequentially improved performance versus the prior party.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   They still have not yet reached prior levels.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Even during this challenging time,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   we continue to be relentless in investing in innovation,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   delivering labor and new improvements,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   driving better efficiencies, managing our cost base,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   and offsetting cost increases to lean manufacturing techniques
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   and capital investments around automation and process flow,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   without sacrificing the health and wellbeing of our team members,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   which remains a priority.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   We are committed to delivering the safest work environment possible,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   improving the quality of our products,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   while achieving our sustainability agenda and bird welfare targets.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Our relative performance to the industry,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   measured as the results of the last 12 months,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   continues to show us improving,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   and all facing the average of the competition in Europe.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   For the next quarter, we expect further improvements,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   coming from the food service and QSR segments,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   as these segments adapt to the situation in each country,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   and remain vigilant and prepared to react and adapt in case market conditions change.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   The performance of our newly acquired European pork operations
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   has continued to improve with EBITDA on an upward momentum.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   We have now been profitable on an EBITDA basis
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   for the last six quarters in a row,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   with margins also increasing on a consistent basis.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   The improvement in performance was driven by robust demand at retail,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   partially offset by reduction in food service,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   continued strengthening pork exports, especially to China,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   as well as the implementation of operation improvements and capture of synergies.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Exports to China remain strong and are up 100% in Q3.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Also, exports to China have doubled as a percentage of our total pork sales,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and we expect demands from China to continue driving the strength and growth fall,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   overall exports in the near future.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   All of our European fresh pork facilities are approved to export from China,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   so we are well positioned to benefit from those opportunities.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   We also continue to evolve in our strategy,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   and we will significantly increase our volumes with a new key customer in the next quarters.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Integration of the assets is ultra-actual expectations.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Over the next few years, we expect to generate an EBITDA improvement
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   to achieve a level that is competitive with leading companies with similar portfolio.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   We have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired European assets
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   through some recent wins to increase our retail exposure
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   and strengthen our partnership with key customers.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   We are optimistic about building upon our operational improvements
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   extract best-in-class operational accents, capitalize export opportunities,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   optimize the portfolio of channels, segments and products,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   as well as strengthening our growth business with key customers
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   to drive innovation in value added and higher margin areas.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   We have a great team in Europe dedicated to generating the best possible relative results
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   by focusing on factors within our control,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   while ensuring protecting the safety and health of our team members.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Point prices have been rising since August,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   driven higher by a combination of stronger than expected export demand
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   and smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the U.S.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 2.17 billion bushels
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   versus 1.99 billion last year,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   which includes a 550 million bushels increase in export demand.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   The current corn crop is projected at 14.7 billion bushels,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   the highest in four years,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   and over 1 billion bushels larger than last year.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Although corn prices have risen from the lows we saw in August,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   prices are very similar to where they were this time last year.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Soybean yield prices have also risen since August,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   driven higher by larger than expected export demand,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   primarily to China.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   USDA is projecting the current soybean crop at 4.3 billion bushels,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   up over 700 million from last year.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Despite the large increase in production,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 290 million bushels,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   the lowest level in four years.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   The uncertainty over the size of the Chinese import program
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   is causing increasing uncertainty
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   and volatility in the oil seeds market globally.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Wheat prices in Europe has also risen recently
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   despite the larger than expected Russian wheat crop
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   and projected increased supply in other major wheat exporters like Australia.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   A slow start to the planting season in Russia
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   and larger than expected export demand out of the U.S.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   are contributing to the rise prices in the wheat market.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   On the chicken production, according to the USDA,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Q3 was down half of a percent relative to Q3 2019,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   as increased live weights did not offset headcount reductions.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   The industry continues to maintain a larger layer flock
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   with current levels 4.4 percent above last year,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   in line with the trends observed in QLXC.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   The industry has also managed to reduce the average age of laying hands,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   promoting a younger, more efficient breed.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   This has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   to manage supply of eggs in the short term
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   while enabling growth in the long term
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   as the demand environment improves.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Overall, the trend has shown a slowing of bullet placement growth,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   which is in line with expectations,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   given that most of the bullet placement increases in 2019
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and early to 2020 were expected to be supportive of new capacity
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   that has come online over that period.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   From Q2 to Q3, COVID-19-related restrictions have slowly been rolled back,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   with many businesses and restaurants opening under modified environments
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   to protect worker and consumer health.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Throughout this process, consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and have continued to modify their shopping and spending habits
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   in response to the new normal environment.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   This new consumer environment favors the retail channel,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   as many consumers are still required to work from home
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   and choosing to limit the exposure to potentially more crowded areas.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   As a result, retail demands for chickens, like that of all proteins,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   have remained supported throughout the quarter.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   While food stamps demand still trail below years ago level,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   this channel has proven highly adaptable
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   and continues to improve each month from the low points in April,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   led by the QSR segments.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And thank you for the USDA expect production to be flat for the quarter
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   on a year over a year basis.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Before 2021, in which the USDA expect oil production to grow,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   0.9% versus 2020.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   High unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute to a food microenvironment
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   and the fallout effects of COVID-19 will impact the channels differently.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   We expect the restriction of restaurant capacities,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   social distancing guidelines, consumer concern for individual health,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   to continue favoring the increased frequency of at home meals.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Since chicken continues to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   retail demand is likely to remain above year ago levels.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   While we expect overall food service demand to remain more volatile
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   and remain below year ago levels, at least in the near term,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   QSR's ability to adapt quickly to the new environment
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   in a positive sign for the chicken industry moving from late 2020 to 2021.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   while minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   While we are already well balanced in terms of our birthside exposure,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   we will remain diligent in seeking opportunities to incrementally diversify our product mix
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   while optimizing our existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Our key customer approach is strategic
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   and creates a basis for further accelerate growth in important categories
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   by promoting more customized, high quality, innovative products
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   to give us a clear, long term, sustained, competitive advantage
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   while further improving the resilience to market filtration.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   With that, let's turn to additional details to our financiers.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Our SG&A in the third quarter was higher versus a year ago
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   as we improved the efficiencies of our expenses
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   but increased support for expanding the Just Bear brand nationally
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   and the investment for our new prepared foods products,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   both in US and Mexico,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   as well as the inclusion of the new assets in Europe.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Also included in the report that SG&A is our $50 million contribution
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   to the hometown strong initiative and the DOJ agreement.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   We will continue to prioritize our capital spending plan this year
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   to optimize our product mix
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   that is aimed at improving our ability to supply innovative, less monetized products
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   and strengthening partnerships with key customers.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Even during these uncertain times,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   while we continue to evaluate all CAPEX projects
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   and defer those we deem known essential,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   we reiterate our commitment to investing on strong return on capital employee projects
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   that will improve our operational efficiencies
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   and tailor customer needs to further solidify competitive advantages for customers.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Our balance sheets continue to be robust.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Given our relentless emphasis on cash flows from operating activities,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   focus on management of working capital
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   and discipline investment in high return projects.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Our liquidity position remains very strong
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   with more than $1.3 billion in total cash and availability.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   We have no short-term immediate cash requirements
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   with our bonds maturing in 2025 and 2027
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   and our terminal maturing in 2023.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   During the quarter, our net debt was $1.9 billion,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   the lowest since 2016,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   and a leverage ratio for 2.5 times less than 12 months ago.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Our leverage remains at a manageable level
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and we expect to continue to produce positive cash flows this year,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   increasing our financial capability to pursue strategic actions.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   We expect 2020 interest expense of around $132 million.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   We have a strong balance sheet and a leverage that is within our target,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   which are supportive for us to act on great opportunities during these uncertain times.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   We will remain focused on exercising great care
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and ensuring that we create shareholder value
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   by optimizing our capital structure
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   while preserving the flexibility to pursue a growth strategy.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   We will continue to consider and evaluate
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   all relevant capital allocation strategies
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   that will match the pursuit of our growth strategy
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   and continue to review each prospect accordingly to our value-creating standards.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Operator, these concludes our prepared remarks.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Please open the call for questions.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Thank you.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   We will now begin the question and answer session.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   In the interest of allowing equal access,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   we request that you limit your questions to two,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   then re-drain the queue for any follow-up.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   To ask a question, you may press star and one on your substance phone.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   If you are using a speakerphone,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to minimize background noise.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   To withdraw your question, please press star, then two.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   This first question is from Benjamin Toyer with Barclays.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Please go ahead.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Hi, good morning. This is Anthony Hernandez on behalf of Ben Toyer.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   My question is regarding COVID-19.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   How is your current level of absenteeism at plant?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   How has that evolved in recent weeks,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   considering the continuously high number of cases in the U.S.?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And also, if you can provide some of the kind of a wrong rate
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   of protective measures related to COVID-19 during the quarter,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   and what do you see going forward?
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Thanks.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Yeah, thank you. Good morning.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   First, as we face this global coronavirus pandemic,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   we have been guided by three principles.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   First, an uncompromised commitment to the safety of our team members.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Second, recognizing and embracing our responsibility
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   to provide quality food for the country,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   and of course, endeavoring to provide continued employment opportunities
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   and benefits to our team members during a time of unprecedented economic appeal.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   So the direct costs that we are related to the extra cleaning
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   in our production in common areas.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   We also provide the PPE and E, including the masks and feed shoots,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   to all of our team members.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And we install physical barriers in our production area,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   and of course, we are maintaining social distancing wherever, wherever areas we can.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   We do more than 10,000 barriers within the first 30 days of the pandemic,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and we continue to upgrade those barriers.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   We also install that dual technology UV and bi-cornery ionization
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   As I mentioned, we are offering free live health online services
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   for all of our team members that allow for virtual doctor visits at zero costs.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   And above all CDC guidelines,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   we remove the vulnerable team members from facilities
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   with full pay and benefits during community outbreak.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   And that is creating some challenges to our operations
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   because by removing those people, we have less people at our plants.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Yeah, the situation is very fluid.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   It varies from plant to plant.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   But over the last months, we have increased our staffing
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   to close to the levels that we were before COVID.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   So we are already running a much better mix that we were during the Q2.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And we are seeing a very good increase in our absenteeism levels.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   As people are more familiar with what we are doing,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   as we are gaining the trust of the entire communities,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   people are less reluctant to return to work.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And with that, we've been improving our ability to execute the optimal mix.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Of course, we are also working with our key customers to simplify our mix
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   to create a more optimal footprint.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And with the frequent communication with them,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   we are ensuring there are team members.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   We expect to return to the optimal operation in this quarter.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Perfect. Thanks a lot. I'm going to work on your results.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   The next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Hey, good morning, everyone. Good morning, Ken.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Just two questions. One is, as you change your mix,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   what was the mix between big, small, and medium, say, last year,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   and then what do you think it's going to be now,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   and then what do you think it's going to be in about a year from now
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   as you adjust your product mixes?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Yeah, Ken, we are well-balanced between small birds,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   tree peg, and large birdie boning.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   What we are doing is, as the demand has been shifting to more retail,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   we've been shifting our operations also with the growth of QSR.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   We've also adapted those conditions.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   What we are doing for 2021 is to first move that plant from big birdie boning
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   to small birdie boning, which will increase our presence in that segment.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   We are also doubling the capacity in our Minnesota plant
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   to comply or support the growth of our key customers
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   and adjust their brand, which has doubled the sales in the online channel
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   over this quarter.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Looking into overall portfolio, we move from 46% of our total sales
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   in retail to around 51%, just in 2020, with small changes in our operation.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   For next year, expect a 2% increase in that portfolio to the retail,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   and a 1% to 2% increase in the small bird with those two conversions.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Great.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   My next question is, can you talk about the sustainability of the Mexican margins?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Particularly, I did see that there was a little bit of a FX benefit.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   How do you think about the Mexican operation?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   I think you did say that it's still continuing the momentum into the fourth quarter.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   How do you think about it for 2021?
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   How do we frame it in our minds?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Yeah, sure, Ken.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   We've been talking about Mexico over the last year that they are very volatile,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   quarter over quarter, but they are more stable if you think a longer period of time
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   or within a year.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   What happened in the first quarter or the first semester in Mexico
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   was a complete imbalance during supply and demand.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   So the industry increased supply during the first semester.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And at the same time, demand, because of the COVID-19,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   really create a challenging environment.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   As you remember in Mexico, there was no support from the government
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   with the COVID-19 like we had in the U.S. and Europe.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   There was no governmental stimulus or unemployment benefits.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   We created a sharp slowdown and recession in the region.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   It really affected the demand, both in the food service and retail.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   While in the U.S., we saw an increasing retail compensating,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   at least partially, the shutdown in food service that didn't happen in Mexico.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   And that's why the supply and demand was completely off balance.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   The industry adapted their supply for the Q3,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   and we at Pilgrims adapted to that situation as well.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   We reduced our costs and we also cut production.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   The supply and demand improved a lot.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   And we saw the rebound in the food service and demand in Q3.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   And now we have very stable prices during this time in Mexico.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   We expect this to continue during Q4.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Q4 has always been a stronger quarter for Mexico with the festivities.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   We don't know at which point that will be reduced because of the COVID restrictions.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   We've seen some increase in cases in Mexico.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   So there could be some more restrictions in the Q4,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   but given the supply and demand situation that we are right now,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   the results are sustainable.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Now, for Q1, we expect the industry to increase production to adequate supply and demand,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   and the return to more normal levels.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   but we expect to be very stable year over year.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Of course, our strategy is supportive of the growth
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   to increase the higher margin differentiated products as well.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   We saw a little bit of impact in the prepared foods, especially on the more affordable products during Q1,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   but we continue to invest and highly differentiated the pigments products continue to sell really well.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Along the turn, despite the volatility, Mexico is a growing economy,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   and as the population increase their disposable income,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   it leads to a significant growth in protein consumption.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Great. I really appreciate that answer.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Thank you. Okay.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   The next question is from Ben Bienvenue with Steven Ings.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Please go ahead.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Good morning.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   I want to ask, you touched on in your opening comments with ASF in China and Germany.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   I want to ask on Germany more specifically.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I would think that's a nice boon for the tool of business.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Just curious on what you're seeing in that business,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   both as it relates to the impact on the domestic market
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   and then an uptick in potential demand from that market as well
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   and how you think your position to capture that benefit.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Yeah. Thank you Ben.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   The operations in Europe are more focused on the retail.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   So we produce most of our products in UK for the retail UK market.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   And because of the high welfare, we command the premium in that region.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   The big competition, as you referred,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   is on the food service sector of imported products from Poland and Germany mainly
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   and Spain on the pork side.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   As the Germans have these issues with their production
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   and because of the ban in China, it actually increases the sales in the UK market.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   It also creates the opportunity for our UK products to be sold into China.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   So what we saw is that on the, what we call fifth quarter products,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   a significant increase in pricing.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   But on the normal products like loins and others,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   we see the prices more stable because it's a zero sum game at the end of the day.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   So it increases the opportunity to China, so that was welcome.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I think our sales have, like we mentioned, have doubled during Q3
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   and we're seeing some very stable pricing.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   But it also increases the competition in the food service segments in the UK.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Okay, great.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   My second question is related to grain.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And apologies if I missed this in your opening comment.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I did hear your overview of the market.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Could you talk about how your position is relative to the market?
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   You know, are you more hand and mouth at the moment?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Do you have any basis secured?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Any color you could offer there on how your position, you know,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   is a balance of fourth quarter and into next year would be helpful.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Hey Ben, this is Joe.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Thank you for the question.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Obviously we've seen prices of corn and soybean no increase in the last few months,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   which has been the result of a few factors for corn.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   We've seen a reduction from the supply side with USDA reporting 6 million fewer planted acres
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   than they originally estimated back in March.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   We also saw our final stocks for 2019 end up being 200 million bushels less
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   than was expected when the final counting was done.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   On the current crop, we actually for the acres of our planet see pretty good yields
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   above trend line yield, so it's not an issue on the supply side in terms of U.S. production.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   But on the demand side, we've also seen much bigger exports demand primarily driven by China.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Still the USDA is projecting a carrier out of around 2.1 billion bushels,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and that includes a 30% increase in export demand from last year.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   So even if export demand ends up higher than what USDA is projecting,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   corn stocks should still be in line with previous years.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   On soybeans, USDA is projecting a 290 million bushel carryout,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   which would be the lowest carryout in five years.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   This projection, though, includes a 31% increase in export demand driven by China.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   In addition, an increased export demand, Argentina,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   which is one of the world's largest oil seed exporting countries,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   is in the midst of a historic economic crisis,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   which is causing farmers there to hold back available supplies from the market,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   adding more pressure to the U.S. to meet this demand.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   We believe the market is likely to feel anxious about U.S. soybean supplies
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   until there's a resolution to this currency situation in Argentina,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   or until South American supplies can be available to meet this demand.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   In terms of how our positions, we've always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   to the market conditions and the risk we see,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   and we feel very comfortable with where we are in corn and soy.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   We do recognize the risk of soybean supplies in the U.S. and our positions reflect that.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Okay, awesome. Thanks, and best of luck.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   As a reminder, if you have a question, please press star then 1.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   The next question is from Michael Picken with Cleveland Research.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Please go ahead.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Yeah, hi. Good morning.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   I just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of the move, I guess,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   into retail, and some of that Big Bird product,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   is that being chopped up and put into trades,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   and how is that impacting some of the margins on the commodity business?
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Yes, Mike, there's a lot of product from the Big Birds,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   especially during promotional seasonality during the summer
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   that from the Big Birds end up being put in the trade to be sold in the retailers.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   We continue to do that.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I think the challenge to the industry is that we need to have the label available
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   and the facilities available to do more of that,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   and that's why the industry has not increased more the production to the trade pack
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   as we want, or as the demand continues to grow.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   It's also because of that we are increasing the capacity in our Minnesota plant.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   So as of today, yes, we are buying Big Bird meat, and we continue to put it on the trade,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   especially during Saturdays, and I think the whole industry is doing that.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Okay, great.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   And then my second question is just looking at the --
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   you mentioned that your absentee rates are starting to go down
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   and you're starting to get back to your normal mix.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   In terms of some of the deboned dark meat,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   are you starting to return that to historic levels, and what could that mean for the leg quarter prices,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   which is seeing the most pressure?
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Can that help, or is the fact that China is taking more poor?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Can that help with leg quarters?
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Why haven't leg quarter prices moved if there's more deboned dark meat potentially being produced,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   and it seems like at the very least China is taking more U.S. poor?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Yes, you're right, Mike.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Because of the absenteeism and also the food service industry in U.S.,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   the industry produced 3% more leg quarters in July and August than the same period last year,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   despite a lower total production.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   That put a lot of pressure in the leg quarter pricing.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   As we are seeing more the reopening of the food service,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   and as we are seeing the absenteeism and the staffing of our clients increasing for us and for the whole industry,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   we are seeing more deboning.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   We are already at levels comparable to last year in terms of deboning,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   which will reduce the pressure in the leg quarters.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Of course, China has been also more active in the leg quarter market over the last month,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   and we are seeing that in the leg quarter inventory that was up on a sequentially basis up to August,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   but we are seeing a reduction.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   And also the inventory today is down 9% compared to the peak Q1 average that we have.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   So those two factors can contribute to the reduction in the leg quarter production,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   which is a commodity item, as I mentioned.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   And the China interest, I think we saw over the last weeks, although not today,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   the increase in the oil prices and the reduction in the dollar,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   which increased the availability of dollars from the developing countries,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   which also increases the demand for leg quarters.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   So what could help on the leg quarters going forward is both on supply and demand.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   On the supply is exactly what you said,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   less leg quarters because of the improvement in labor efficiencies,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   and the more sales in the domestic market on the food service,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   and on demand because of low prices and because of more available income in the developing economies.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Fabio, just as I'm thinking about it, the small bird and resale channels
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   obviously have been tremendously profitable for you guys during this time period,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   and with the plant conversion coming, but with commodity big bird remaining,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   I want to put out that you have here remaining under such pressure,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   just at what point does it make sense to start talking about converting another plant,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   whether that's to retail or to small bird,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   because it just seems like that big bird portion is not going to improve
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   without more capacity either being converted or taking out of the market in some capacity.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Sure, thank you Peter.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   I think the decision to convert the plant is a more long-term decision,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   and we always make those decisions combined with our key customer strategy.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   As we see the demand of these key customers growing, we take action in our portfolio.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   So, and that makes a lot of sense for us to do that conversion right now
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   from that operation from big bird to small bird to support this growth.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   I think, again, you need to look into a more broader long-term perspective.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   If we continue to expect the food service sector to rebound,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   if you look at the food service sector, today the food service restaurants are now 13% year over year,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   and that is impacting the big bird deboning for sure, while the key offers are up 9%.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   As we go to a more normal operations, as we see maybe the development of vaccines,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   we don't know when that's going to happen, or we see more openings of the restaurants,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   we expect the food service restaurants, especially on the full service,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   to regain some market share that they are not operating today.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   So, I think it's a long-term decision, and it's also a very difficult decision
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   to move from big bird to a smaller, because we have the growers and we have the feed mills.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   It's all built to that specific bird.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Our plants in the United States are really customized to that specific segment.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   So, any conversion, it really requires significant capital
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   and requires some significant changes in the overall supply chain,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   both starting from the growers, your feed mills, and your field operations.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   So, it's a high capital investment that needs to be supported for the long run.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   So, that's why we don't see a lot of conversions in our industry.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Of course, if this situation continues for a longer period of time, you can see some conversions.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   I think also it's important to know that some other players don't have the key customer relationships
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   that we have, and moving from the big bird to the small bird, or to the keys ready,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   require a customer and a key customer to support.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   And since they don't have those relationships, it's harder for them to do some conversions.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   No, that's helpful.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   And then maybe just to follow up, you know, given where the balance sheet is now,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   and something you talked about in your pair of remarks, you know, how should we think about M&A potential,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   maybe from a geographic perspective, or does it make sense to get bigger in pork in Europe
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   and, you know, going into 2021.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Just any help there, and then maybe you can also comment on any updates on your CFO search.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Thanks very much.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Sure. In terms of strategy, I think our strategy continues to fail,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   and our growth strategy continues intact, and as we mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   We're looking to increasing our prepared foods operation and our branded operation to create a more balanced portfolio.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   And we're also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more value from operational efficiencies.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   We're seeing targets both in the US and outside the US, geographical diversification, and to growth in Europe.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   And we will evaluate all alternatives to our value creation standards.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   In terms of the CFO, we are in the process of finding another CFO.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   We already engage recruiting firms, and we should have some news in the near future.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Great. Thanks very much, guys.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   The next question is from Adam Stein-Wilson with Goldman Sachs & Co. Please go ahead.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Morning, Adam.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Alright, so maybe first just a clarification or a little more detail on the expansion of the Minnesota plant for case ready
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   and the conversion of the Texas plant to Smallbird from Big Bird.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   What's the net impact on your production volume?
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   What's the capital cost for those projects?
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Yeah, in terms of total volume, I think we should be just a little bit up.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   We expect to be to grow in line with USDA expectations in the industry for 2021, which is a little bit lower than 1%.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Yes, as we have more birds in Minnesota, but we also reduce the weight in our operation on the Big Bird that we are just from into a small bird.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   We expect to be for 2021 in line with those two.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   In terms of investments, it's not very significant to our total capex.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   As the conversion of the Smallbird plant, it's a simpler conversion.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   Of course, that QSR requires some DSI, which is portioning equipment and some marination equipment.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And we're going to invest in automation in that plant as well.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   It's a manual deboning operation, and we're going to invest in automated deboning.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   So the investment is close to $20 to $25 million in that operation.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   And in the case of the case ready operation, it's close to $70 million.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   So overall, it is a total of $100 million that we're going to invest in those two conversions.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   That's a helpful call there. And the follow-up was -- I just want to make sure I heard something right from the paragraph remarks.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   He talks about the prepared food business in the U.S. declining 26%, I think is what I heard.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   And maybe hoping to expand on that, that's a business that I think has had a bit more challenges over the years and just is --
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   is it really just a question of returns of school and food service traffic, or how do we think about that business from a margin profile moving forward?
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   In our prepared food business, we have a strong brand, which is the Pierce brand that is meaning a food service brand.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   We also are very strong in the school with our Gold Kiss brand.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Both those segments are the ones that are most affected by the COVID-19.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   The non-commercial food service that includes schools were down 66% at Q2, and now they are down 43%.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   We are seeing some school reopens, which could help, but it's a segment that is still down 40%.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   On what we call the commercial food service, which is a street business where our Pierce brand is a leading brand in wings and in chunks,
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   we saw that at Q2, they end up 36% lower than the prior year, but they're rebounding,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   and then today, they are close to 4% lower than the same period last year.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   So the food service business has been recovering, and with that, our Pierce brand has recovered in our volumes,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   but the school system is still close to 40% lower than the prior year.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   And that's why we're investing in more retail branded business.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   As we mentioned, our Pierce brand has increased more than 30%, and we have been very successful in spending the Just Bear brand
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   on the fresh category, but it's been very successful on the online segment and also on the higher attribute segment in our key customers,
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   to the prepared food segment.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   All right, great. That's helpful color. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   Thank you, Anna.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   The next question comes from Carla Cazella with St. Timorgan. Please go ahead.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Hi. My question is regarding your leverage. The three times target, how comfortable or how high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional M&A?
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   And are you seeing any more M&A opportunities just given the volatility in worldwide protein markets?
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   Yeah, thank you, Carla. We set this target of two to three times because it's the best capital structure that can protect and reduce our interest payments
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   while not creating any problem for our bonds and for our leverage.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   The two to three times is in normal operations. Of course, during some acquisition, if we have a great plan on how to reduce that back, we can go further.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I don't think there is a number that is specific on where we go. I think it's more about what is the plan to leverage.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   And of course, the plan to the leverage could include the issue of stock. And that's why Pilgrims as a public traded company has that opportunity to use the stock as a currency,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   not to increase the leverage to points where we don't think it is prudent in the case of significant acquisition that will be transformational for the company.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   Okay. And just one last point. No, sorry. In terms of M&A, yes, we are seeing more targets. Of course, the whole situation about traveling has created some challenges in terms of seeing and visiting assets.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   But we are seeing some targets that are still very interesting to us and could create a lot of value for our shareholders.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   Okay, great. And then just in the event that JBS is able to list the U.S. business, would that cause any need for changing your structure?
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Yeah, we don't believe so. I think JBS has said many times that they continue to support Pilgrims to be a public traded company.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   And just as I mentioned, it is a great way for us to keep our growth. We can use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important and transformational event for Pilgrims.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   Okay, thank you.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Once again, if you have a question, please press star and one on your telephone.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   Gentlemen, there are no more questions registered at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Fabio Sandri for closing remarks.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   Well, thank you all. We would like to reiterate our continued commitment to our valued team members to provide them with a safe and healthy working environment
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   while supporting our duty to maintain food production and supply to customers. We are looking forward to closing 2020 with good results in spite of the volatility.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Our diverse portfolio of differentiated products tailored to support our key customer strategy in conjunction with our broad geographic footprint.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   We continue to generate consistent performance and minimize margin volatility in challenging market conditions relative to competitors.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   We will continue to seek new growth potential both organically and through acquisitions while offering even more differentiated products portfolio within our business to support key customers needs by cultivating a culture of constant innovation.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   We would like to thank everyone in the Pilgrims family, including our family farm partners, suppliers, and our customers who make our business possible.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   As always, we appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you for joining us today.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   >> Welcome to the ever source energy Q3 2020 results conference call.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.040]   My name is John and I'll be over here for today's call.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.980]   At this time all participants are on list in only mode.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.880]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.720]   During the question and answer session if you do have a question press star
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.460]   then one on your touch phone phone.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.260]   Please note that this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.680]   And I want to turn the call over to Jeffrey Cockton.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.200]   >> Thank you very much John.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.180]   Good morning and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.080]   I'm Jeff Cockton, ever source energy's vice president for investor relations.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.360]   During this call we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.400]   And as you can see on slide one some of the statements made during this investor call may be
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.080]   forward looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.020]   of the US private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.800]   The forward looking statements are based on management's current expectations
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.660]   and are subject to risk and uncertainty which may cause the actual results
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.780]   to differ materially for forecast and projections.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.100]   These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.740]   Additional information about the various factors
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.900]   that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on form 10K
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.300]   for the year ended December 31st, 2019 and our form 10Q for the three months ended June 30th, 2020.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.520]   Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAP measures
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.980]   and how those measures reconcile to GAP results is contained within our news release
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.100]   and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10K.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.800]   Seeking today will be Phil Lembo, our executive vice president and CFO.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.640]   Also joining us today are Joe Nolan, our executive vice president
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.620]   for strategy, customer and corporate relations.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.260]   John Marrera, our treasurer and senior VP for finance and regulatory
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260]   and Jay Booth, our controller.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.660]   Now I will turn slide two and turn over the call to Phil.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.840]   >> Thank you Jeff, good morning everyone.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.220]   I hope everyone on the call remains healthy
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.740]   and that your families are safe and doing well.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.040]   This morning I'll cover a variety of areas, review the results of the third quarter,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.920]   discuss recent regulatory developments including the acquisition of the assets
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.200]   of Columbia GAS of Massachusetts, provide an update on recent developments
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.680]   around our offshore wind partnership with Orsif.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.040]   I'll start with slide two noting that recurring earnings were $1.02 per share
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.720]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of 98 cents per share
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.300]   in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.560]   GAP results which include a charge of 1 cent per share relating
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.740]   to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia GAS
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.960]   of Massachusetts, total $1.01 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.120]   In the first nine months of 2020, recurring earnings excluding Columbia GAS acquisition
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.540]   cost total $2.80 per share compared with recurring earnings of $2.69 per share
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.580]   in the first nine months of 2019
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.280]   and excluding the northern path transmission impairment charge.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.460]   GAP results for September of this year were $2.76 per share.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.280]   Turning to our business segments, our electric distribution segment earned $0.60 per share
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.360]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.740]   The low earnings were results of both higher storm restoration costs
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.680]   and property tax expense as well as the impact of sub-shared dilution.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.340]   Our electric transmission segment earned $0.36 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.680]   with recurring earnings of $0.33 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.440]   Improved results were driven by the continued investment and reliability
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.580]   in our transmission facilities partially offset by shared dilution.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.260]   Our gas distribution segment lost $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2020
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.880]   compared with a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of last year.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.760]   Improved results were due to higher revenues.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.780]   I should note that because we didn't close on our acquisition
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.660]   of Columbia gas of Massachusetts assets until October 9th,
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:04.320]   the transaction had no impact on this gas segment, the segment during the quarter.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.820]   Each quarter of this year, we booked acquisition related costs at the parent
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.780]   and have segregated them for increased transparency.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.340]   Beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, ongoing results of our new gas franchise
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.660]   which is named Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts will be reflected in the natural gas segment.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.060]   Integration related costs however will continue to be recorded separately
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.140]   at the parent and excluded from our recurring gas earnings.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:45.080]   Our water distribution segment earned $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2020
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.580]   compared with earnings of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.260]   Improved results were due to a $3.5 million after tax gain on the sale
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.500]   of our Hena Massachusetts area facilities to the town.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.460]   Eversource parent earned $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020 excluding the Columbia gas
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.880]   of Massachusetts asset acquisition cost equal to our earnings in the third quarter of last year.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.280]   As you probably noted in our earnings release and can see on slide three,
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:30.600]   we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings per share guidance of $3.60 to $3.70
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:38.520]   and is excluding the non-recurring costs related to the purchase of Columbia gas of Massachusetts assets.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.620]   We are also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.060]   from our core regulated business through the year 2024.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.700]   We continue to be, to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range largely due
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.080]   to the investments we need to make on behalf of our customers
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.040]   as we outlined for you earlier in the year.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.900]   As a reminder, while we fully expect the Columbia gas assets to be accreted
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:16.540]   to our earnings per share starting immediately in 2021, we have not yet updated our long-term
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.300]   financial outlook to reflect the acquisition of Columbia gas assets
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.460]   in our capital, our cap backs that are our earnings growth.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.820]   In addition, as we disclosed previously, earnings from offshore wind would be incremental
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.140]   to our core business growth.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:40.140]   We'll provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecasts adding
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.500]   in EPS gas company Massachusetts projections and provide an update
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.860]   of our offshore wind partnership during our year-end call in late February.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.820]   From the third quarter results, I'll turn to slide four and our experience restoring power
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:03.960]   after tropical storm ETIES ravaged Connecticut on October 4th.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.840]   We serve 149 cities and towns in Connecticut and every one
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.900]   of these communities suffered damage from ETIES, much of it catastrophic.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:20.520]   As you can see on the slide, we had nearly 22,000 damage locations
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.840]   that we had to address and brought in an army of electric restoration
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.800]   and tree crews to restore power, all the while working on the restoration
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.380]   in a pandemic setting.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.740]   The restoration process lasted nine days, meaning we completed our work one
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.660]   to two days faster than we had in the last two tropical storms that hit Connecticut,
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:51.040]   even though we had 30 to 35 percent more damage locations and most importantly,
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.060]   we completed that work safely with no serious electrical contact and no COVID exposure
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.100]   among the enormous work force we brought to Connecticut.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:07.860]   Just a tremendous effort by all of our employees from across all parts of every source.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:16.160]   At this time, we estimate that deferred costs across all three states will total more
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:23.180]   than $275 million, with a vast majority of that some incurred in Connecticut.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:29.040]   That figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.380]   We're still actively pursuing invoices from hundreds of vendors
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.240]   that assisted us during the statewide restoration effort.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.940]   Where we were setting new poles or hanging miles of new wires or replacing hundreds
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.000]   of transformers, these related costs ought to be capitalized.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.520]   The ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation of performance in safety
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.160]   and expeditiously restoring power to our customers is pending an ongoing review
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.460]   by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or PURRA.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:11.040]   That review is scheduled to be completed in late April of 2021.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:18.400]   Sticking with our regulated business, I'll turn to slide five
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.740]   and a review of this year's distribution rate reviews.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:27.880]   This past Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities issued its decision
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.920]   in the N* gas rate review that we filed last year.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.620]   It supports our continued investment in the N* gas system on behalf of our 300,000 customers.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.740]   The decision allows N* gas to increase distribution revenues
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.580]   by $23 million on an annualized basis.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.080]   The DPU approved an ROE of 9.9% and a capital structure
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.180]   with a 54.77% equity.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:02.220]   It also permits us to implement performance-based rate making for a 10-year term
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:09.820]   that with sounds operating performance by N* gas will target annual base rate increases
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.180]   of inflation plus 1.03%.
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:19.720]   This is an earnings sharing mechanism that would return 75% of the benefit to customers
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:25.160]   should we see the ROE of 10.9% and sharing mechanism on the downside
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.800]   if our ROE falls below 8.4%.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.600]   Also exciting is the decision also approves our first ever geothermal pilot program.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:40.040]   Our other longstanding rate proceeding involves public service of New Hampshire.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:46.300]   In New Hampshire last month, we and all the parties to the PSNH rate case filed a proposed settlement
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.420]   in the rate review that is pending for nearly, you know, a year and a half.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:57.640]   You can see from the slide, we settled on a $45 million annualized rate increase
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:05.660]   that includes a 9.3% return on equity and a 54.4% equity layer.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:11.340]   Should regulators approve the settlement, the permanent increase would take effect
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.500]   in January 1st of 2021.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.000]   You may recall that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission allowed us
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.740]   to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately $28 million back in July.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.080]   July 1st of 2019.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.640]   The final approved rates would be retroactive back to that date, 18 months.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.320]   We would recover that in a true up over the course of the year 2021.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.220]   We can settle -- consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.240]   to PSNH's first general increase in about a decade.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:56.160]   And have asked the New Hampshire PUC to approve the settlement before the end of November.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.320]   From the rate review, reviews, I'll turn to slide 6.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.520]   And our recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas and Massachusetts
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:12.140]   for $1.1 billion of cash excluding working capital adjustments.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.260]   Most of these assets were signed to Everplace Gas Company in Massachusetts,
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.480]   a new subsidiary I mentioned that we formed in May of 2020.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.420]   As you can see on the slide, much of Everplace Gas' service territory is adjacent
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.060]   to Endstar Gas or Yankee Gas Service Territories.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:37.360]   Additionally, Endstar Electric already provides electric service to about 20
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.140]   of the communities that Everplace Gas serves with natural gas.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:49.160]   As a result, we expect to realize operational benefits for our newest 330,000 natural gas customers
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.380]   and the communities where they live.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:00.360]   To finance the transaction, we sold approximately $500 million of equity in June,
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.340]   and we financed the death portion of the transaction in August.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.440]   And again, we are very confident that this transaction will be accretive
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.800]   to our earnings per share in 2021 and incrementally accretive in the years ahead.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.880]   A critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.100]   to all stakeholders is an eight-year rate plan that we negotiated
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.960]   with the Massachusetts Attorney General and other key parties prior to our filing
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.200]   with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.240]   The key elements of that plan are listed on slide seven.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.880]   It will allow us to make the necessary investments in our episode gas of mass system
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.000]   and reflect those investments and rates in a reasonably timely manner.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.140]   We're thankful that the DPU approved the settlement
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.660]   and the acquisition very quickly.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.200]   Now that we have the key to the property and a long-term plan in place,
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.920]   we are focused on providing our new ever source gas customers with the same high level
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:06.340]   of service that we provide our other 550,000 natural gas distribution company customers
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.220]   that we have in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:15.400]   As I noted earlier, we plan to integrate ever source gas of Massachusetts
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.180]   into our updated five-year projections that we'll provide you in February.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.060]   We continue to project approximately $3 billion
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:30.140]   of regulated company capital investments this year despite the challenges posed
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:35.660]   by the pandemic and the need to take crews off of capital projects for a significant pot
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.480]   of August to deal with the aftermath of Tropical Storm Isaias.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:46.240]   Through September, our capital investments totaled approximately $2.2 billion.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.220]   That's approximately the same level as this time last year in 2019.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.200]   We made considerable progress on our transmission capital program
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.860]   in the third quarter, putting several projects into service at or below budget.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:08.780]   These benefits of lower costs will slow through to New England's electric customers.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:15.860]   From the regulated business, I'll turn to offshore wind partnership with Orsted on slide eight.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.820]   We've had a few developments since our July 31st earnings call.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:28.020]   The most significant development was that in August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:35.200]   posted a complete review schedule for our 130 megawatt South Fork project on Long Island.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.900]   The schedule culminates in a decision on a construction
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:46.380]   and operations permit, or COP as it's known, in mid-January of 2022.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.200]   We are also making progress on the other permit.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.900]   In September, we filed a settlement proposal with the New York Department of Public Service
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:01.780]   to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the construction, operations,
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.980]   and maintenance of the project that lies within New York jurisdiction.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:12.780]   In October, several of New York State agencies signaled their support for this proposal
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.820]   by signing on to the agreement.
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.400]   We've structured an agreement on host community payments
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:25.940]   in the necessary real estate rights with the town of East Hampton, where the offshore cable will land,
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.960]   and will be connected to the Long Island grid.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.260]   New York Public Service Commission citing hearings for South Fork is scheduled
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.720]   to commence the first week of December.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:45.180]   We continue to expect the state signing process to be completed in 2021 before bone issues the COP.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:52.120]   Based on that schedule, we now expect the project end to service in the fourth quarter of 2023.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:58.500]   This is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our May and July earnings calls
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.560]   while we were still waiting for the review schedule.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:10.480]   During to our other projects, you recall that we filed our bone application for Revolution Wind in March.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.020]   We expect bone to establish a review schedule for that project in the first quarter
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.220]   of 2021.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:24.420]   We do not expect to provide an updated in-service date for this project until the schedule is issued,
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:31.660]   but at this point, it is unlikely that the project will end the service by the end of 2023.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:39.160]   Also, we filed our sunrise wind application with bone on September 1 and expect bone
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.320]   to establish a review schedule for the project next year.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.560]   Once we receive that review schedule, we'll be able to better estimate a more up-to-date
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.740]   in-service schedule.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:55.320]   But again, at this time, it would seem that the end of '24 in service is not likely.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:01.540]   We're very optimistic about our offshore wind business and expect many opportunities
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.120]   over the coming months and years to expand our offshore wind partnership
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.440]   beyond the 1,714 megawatts currently on the contract.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.440]   As we mentioned before, we have enough leaf capacity to construct at least 4,000 megawatts
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.700]   on the 550 square miles of ocean tracks that we have on the long-term leaf
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.640]   off the southeast coast of Massachusetts.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:33.320]   To this point, on October 20th, we submitted a number of alternative bids
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.960]   into the second New York offshore wind IRSP, where the state is looking for between 1,000
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.860]   and 2,500 megawatts.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.940]   New York state officials have indicated that they expect to announce the winner --
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.460]   or winners -- before the end of the year.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:56.060]   Our sunrise project, as a reminder, won the largest portion
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.500]   of New York's first IRSP last year, 880 megawatts.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:07.500]   Additionally, just last week, Rhode Island Governor Gina Romando announced
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.940]   that her state will target early next year for issuing an IRSP
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.280]   to 600 megawatts of additional offshore wind.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:21.000]   As you know, the majority of our revolution wind capacity, 400 megawatts,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.100]   will be sold to Rhode Island, with the balance going to Connecticut.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.480]   Thank you very much for joining us this morning,
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.660]   and I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.700]   >> Thanks, Phil, and I'll turn the call back to John just to remind you how
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.280]   to enter questions in the Q&A queue.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.440]   >> Thank you.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.580]   If you do have a question, press star then 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.880]   Once again, press star then 1 on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.900]   If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.860]   >> Thank you, John.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.240]   Our first question this morning is from Shah from Guggenheim.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.340]   Good morning, Shah.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.120]   >> Good morning, Jeff.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.740]   Good morning, Phil.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.400]   >> Good morning, Shah.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.160]   So, a couple of questions here.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.720]   Just some of your language around sort of the growth rate, obviously,
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.640]   which still excludes Columbia gas and offshore wind.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.160]   Obviously, these are very creative, and you're already conservatively kind
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.300]   of well within your band.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.220]   So, should we sort of be thinking about these incremental items
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:31.860]   as potentially rating your growth rate to maybe 6% to 8% or something that will hit you
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.320]   to the top end and then sort of extend that runway with your current trajectory?
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:42.120]   I mean, the reason we'll ask is 6% to 8% seems to be sort of that new top quartile bucket
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.280]   in our space where 5% to 7% is becoming a little bit more typical.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.920]   Secures how you're sort of thinking about this?
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:54.180]   Do you see value to be in the top quartile, or you don't think you need to award it for it?
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.860]   So, curious on that as we think about layering its plan.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.160]   >> Sure. Sure.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.500]   Thanks for the question, and I hope you've been doing well.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:13.260]   Certainly, the addition of Columbia gas will be additive to our existing forecast.
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.020]   So, we're working through all the details of that, so we're able to provide you
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:26.840]   with a full update in February, but we expect to get significant benefit from that franchise.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:36.540]   And, as you say, we also expect as those offshore wind projects come online to also be additive.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:43.060]   To remind folks, I know I said it, but and you did, that the 5% to 7% growth rate is
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:49.140]   from the existing core business, which doesn't include Columbia assets.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:54.980]   It also doesn't include grid modernization activities
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:23:05.060]   that are currently pending in Connecticut and New Hampshire or AMI that could be a potential
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:13.040]   to move forward relatively soon in Massachusetts in terms of taking a look at that by the regulator.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.980]   So, I see that we have a number of levers to grow and grow
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.900]   at even a higher rate than we had expected before.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.900]   Got it. That's helpful.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.500]   And then, Phil, just lastly for me, is can you just maybe talk a little bit
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.500]   about your expectations for the legislation in Connecticut?
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.940]   I mean, the legislation that passed was more constructive than the draft legislation,
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.500]   but obviously some disappointment with the refunds and penalties offset
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.740]   by the potential upside from like PBRs.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.440]   So, how are you guys thinking about this entirely?
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:59.260]   Sure, the energy legislation we've said consistently that PBR is a formula
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.540]   and a template that we think is effective.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:11.820]   We have PBR structures in other states, and we think that having a robust discussion
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:18.500]   on PBR in Connecticut makes a lot of sense, so we're very supportive of that provision.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:25.880]   You know, really, you know, the energy legislation directed Pura to evaluate that
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:32.260]   and open a docket by the middle of next year, so June of 2021,
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.880]   and it authorizes Pura to, you know, establish storm standards
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.240]   and potential penalties, as you mentioned.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.960]   There is an increased potential of penalties.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.420]   Currently, those penalties are two and a half percent
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:54.980]   of our distribution revenues in Connecticut, and that goes up to four percent.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.920]   So, you know, it also gives Pura some additional time, you know, to review cases,
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.880]   so, you know, which is also something that, you know, seems to be appropriate.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:13.260]   So, the legislation, as you indicated, is out there and Pura is working through the details
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.700]   of it, and we expect to be working through that in a constructive way
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.360]   with them over the next several months.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.420]   >> Got it.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.060]   Terrific.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:22.920]   That's all I had today.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.740]   Thanks, guys.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.680]   >> All right.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.580]   Thanks, Shar.
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:30.440]   Our next question is from Steve Fleischman from Wolf.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.580]   Good morning, Steve.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.580]   >> Good morning.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.960]   Phil, can you hear me?
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.340]   >> Yes, Steve.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:38.760]   I can.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.640]   Great.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:46.700]   So, just a question on the delays in your offshore wind projects.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.680]   Could you maybe talk to -- I know we don't know the exact timing,
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:59.480]   but how should we think about the impact on the economics of those projects from delay
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.780]   or puts and takes, and is it hurting the economics
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.540]   of the projects you already have signed up to?
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.820]   >> Yeah. Thanks for your question, Steve, and I hope you and your family are doing well.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:20.840]   I guess to go to the puts and takes piece, you know,
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:29.500]   I don't think that folks should automatically think that schedule changes result in ups or downs.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:35.320]   There's some benefits or that people may not consider in that.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:41.380]   So, certainly, if you are looking at adjusted schedules,
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:48.420]   you might be able to adjust your installation vessel optimization better, you know,
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.380]   the turbine sizes themselves are getting larger.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:27:00.620]   So, you could move to larger turbine sizes if projects are due at a later time period
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.180]   versus an earlier time period.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.620]   And certainly, the cost supply chain and availability of materials
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.100]   and supply chain is only getting better.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:19.020]   So, I would say that, you know, there's opportunities for improved cost economics
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:23.860]   as you move into a schedule that, you know, you may not think of, you know,
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:29.020]   I think people generally think of projects as, you know, if it's a delay, it's a cost increase,
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:34.100]   but there are other elements that work here on the offshore wind business that offset that.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:39.460]   >> How about any negatives?
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.380]   Is it how about like, do you lose, you know, lose any tax credits or anything else?
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.220]   >> Yes, certainly.
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.340]   >> I guess just time value?
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:53.580]   >> Yes. In terms of the schedules we're looking at, we don't expect to have any impact
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:59.540]   on our tax assumptions, but certainly, significant delays.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.260]   Delays could have impacts on your tax assumptions.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:09.180]   Delays could also have impacts on contracts that you have with counterparties.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:15.380]   But in our specific case, so that's the general case, in our specific case,
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:22.020]   we're confident that we have the ability to work within both of those, the tax area
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:27.940]   and the contract area in an effective way with where we see the schedules going in the future.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.580]   >> Okay.
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.460]   >> Thank you.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.180]   >> Thank you.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:39.780]   >> Our next question is from Angie from Seaport Global.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.700]   Good morning, Angie.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.140]   >> Good morning.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.540]   So I have a question about Massachusetts.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:53.860]   You may have this very constructive decision for ENSOR gas, but the state is clearly looking
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:29:00.980]   up to the future of gas LDCs, and so how do you guys see it, especially in light
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:06.740]   of the fact that you just acquired an additional gas utility in Massachusetts?
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:13.780]   >> Good morning, Angie, and thank you for your question and hope you're doing well.
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:21.340]   You know, the way that I would position it, the way that I think people should think
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:27.620]   about it is that there's nobody, first of all, who's more aggressive in terms of looking
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.220]   at clean energy strategies and carbon reduction than ever sourced in terms
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.420]   of having carbon neutral goals like 2030.
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:42.020]   We have worked effectively with all parties in all states, but in Massachusetts
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:49.500]   where the Attorney General and others want to take a look at, you know, sort of the future
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:55.300]   or the outlook in terms of the gas business, we've been working
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:00.260]   with these intervening parties for many years, and we'll continue to work with them
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.180]   on what we think an appropriate strategy is there.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:12.860]   So, this is a long-term outlook in terms of that the state wants to, you know,
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:20.660]   have aggressive clean energy and carbon reduction targets with wholly supportive of that,
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.860]   and we look forward to working, you know, with all the parties there,
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:31.380]   but we don't see it as a threat to the gas distribution business in the region at all.
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:41.460]   >> Okay. And in Connecticut, you know, there's this recent back and forth between you guys
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:48.300]   and Pora about the expansion of the lack of basically disconnections on the back of COVID.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:54.860]   I mean, it sounds a bit concerning that Pora is pushing back so strong
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.220]   that they don't need to sign off on that extension.
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.980]   I mean, I would assume that it's an actual practice, normal practice
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:08.940]   for a regulated utility to seek recovery of these, you know, under-recovered revenues.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.700]   I mean, can you give us a sense, you know, how you see it in Connecticut,
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:19.060]   given the latest, you know, legislative changes and also some deterioration
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.580]   and, you know, negative relationships in the state.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:31.940]   >> Yes. So we are not doing shutoffs across all any of our franchises at this point.
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.260]   And specifically, you know, we're working, you know, we're working with customers.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:44.100]   We're working with fuel agencies, assistance agencies on an approach here that works,
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.500]   that work best for customers.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.980]   We've also engaged with Pora, as you mentioned,
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:53.940]   and other government officials, you know, on this issue.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.420]   So I'm confident that we'll get to a good place here.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:04.380]   You know, nobody wants to burden customers with any more than we're all ready.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:10.100]   All of us are burdened with in terms of the economic conditions and COVID, et cetera.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.500]   So we're working through the issue.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:18.100]   We're working with customers, as I say, and some of the assistance agencies.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.980]   And I'm sure we'll get to a good outcome here.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.060]   >> Very good. Thank you.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.580]   >> Thank you, Angie.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.180]   Next question is from Julian from Bank of America.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.100]   Good morning, Julian.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.580]   >> Hey, good morning, team.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.380]   Thanks for the time.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.780]   I hope all of you are doing well and safe with families as well.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.820]   Perhaps just to pick up off of -- or perhaps clarify, if I can,
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.540]   some of the last rounds of questions.
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:51.140]   When you talk about the 4Q roll forward, are you going to be rolling to 2025
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.660]   and then more specifically, how do you think about including
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.580]   or excluding offshore wind in light of the uncertainty described?
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.900]   Should we expect that offshore wind should continue to be at least for those projects
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:08.060]   where there's an undetermined date to continue to be excluded there?
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.500]   >> Julian, thanks for your question and your comments.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.380]   And I hope you and your family are doing well too.
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:20.340]   Just to clarify, we will -- our history has been to add another year
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:25.820]   into the outlook, so 2025 would be that year since our forecast goes
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:31.660]   through the 2024 time period, so that is something that you should expect to see.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.260]   And really our view on how to look at offshore wind,
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:41.780]   it doesn't change by any of the schedule items we talked about today or --
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:49.700]   we've looked at it as showing the core business as the driver
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.180]   and the foundational element of the growth rate.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:58.100]   And then to show that wind is additive to that in what way.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.580]   So that would be the intent going forward.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:07.860]   I think that what I've been asked this question before, the answer is was
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:11.580]   and still is, as more years of wind come
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:16.980]   in to the actual results of that particular year, then to me it makes more sense
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.220]   to roll it all together.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:25.580]   But at this stage the expectation, especially in this upcoming February update,
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:31.060]   would be to have the core business extend that through 2025
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:37.860]   and then show offshore wind in addition to that.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.580]   >> And if you don't mind elaborating a little bit further,
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.500]   I know that there's a certain degree of uncertainty
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.740]   on exactly the perming schedule that inhibits your ability to say one,
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:51.180]   these projects in a region service, can you at least try to put some more parameters
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:55.460]   around what each of these pieces of the process could take such that there's
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.140]   like a window if you will?
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.900]   It may be too early.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:07.980]   >> Yeah, so in terms of, you know, people have realized out there
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:13.380]   and we've been asked questions, I think you've asked us the questions in terms of,
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.260]   you know, with delays on vineyard wind and other things,
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:23.580]   there's been some delays in terms of bone notice of intent
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.020]   and to prepare their environmental impact statement
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:33.500]   and frankly we would have expected in our original schedule that some
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:41.460]   of these NOIs, you know, to prepare the environmental impact statement would be out by now.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:46.500]   So, these are expected, I believe, you know, the plan schedule
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.340]   for reviewing and releasing these is underway.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.780]   So, I wouldn't expect, you know, a significant change in the schedule
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:02.660]   but at this stage it would be prudent to wait to see that the schedule that comes
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:08.780]   out of the bone before we commit to a final in-service date.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.180]   I wouldn't expect it to be significant.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.220]   >> Got it, excellent.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.380]   All right, I'll pass it from there.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.900]   Thank you so much, Steve.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:18.980]   >> Thanks, Julian.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.100]   Next question is from Durgash from Evercore.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.580]   Good morning, Durgash.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.940]   >> Hey, good morning guys.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.500]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:34.380]   Just following up on, you know, the offshore wind here, what do you expect,
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:40.180]   you know, there's this EIS decision, I suppose, that is going to be out or EIS tape
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:44.900]   and rather this month or early December, what do you expect there
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.980]   and then how does that impact your future project timelines?
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:57.980]   >> Yeah, the -- you've noticed a bit of intense that they contain a plan schedule,
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:03.100]   you know, that in the NOIs they have contained bones planned schedule
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.220]   for reviewing each of the cops.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:10.300]   So that would be an important piece of information to have available.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:17.140]   So that's really the -- what's included in that is a plan schedule for reviewing the cop
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:21.660]   that comes out with the notice of an intense.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.740]   >> Right, so I guess maybe I'm talking about the environmental impact statement.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.380]   Isn't there an environmental impact statement that bone was supposed
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:34.420]   to sort of put out here in the next few weeks?
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.900]   >> You're talking about the one for vineyard, right?
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.900]   >> Yes.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:38.900]   Yes.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.900]   Yes.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.900]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:41.900]   Yeah, I'm not.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.900]   I apologize.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:48.780]   You probably have to ask Vineyard Wind on about that.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:53.300]   >> Okay, but that doesn't have a read through for you or your offshore wind project.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:57.260]   I guess that's sort of what my question was.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:02.620]   Well, certainly all of the developers off the coast, you know,
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:08.980]   that we've been going through this cumulative impact study and looking at spacing
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:16.740]   and of wind turbines and we came up with one nautical mile by one nautical mile spacing.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:24.020]   So certainly there could be components that come out in any decision for vineyard wind
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:28.660]   that you'd have to, you know, take a look at to see if it has any impacts, you know,
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.340]   to all the developers including us.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:36.780]   But in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing,
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.500]   I think vineyard might have a better perspective of that.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.420]   >> Okay, perfect.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.260]   That's all I had, guys.
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.500]   Thank you so much.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.060]   >> All right.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.940]   Thanks, Dorgesh.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.260]   Next question is from Jeremy from JT Morgan.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.500]   Good morning, Jeremy.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.180]   Good morning.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.740]   Thanks for having me.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.820]   Just wanted to start off with what are the benefits of looping ConEd
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.940]   into the proposed Sunrise 2, Sunrise Wind 2 RFP here?
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.180]   Every source has the experience of building transmission
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.980]   and we're curious what additional competitive advantages ConEd provides here
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.700]   to this specific project.
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.700]   Can you provide details on potential ownership interests for each entity
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:21.140]   and does ownership interest change once construction is complete
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.860]   and the project is in service?
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.380]   >> Thanks for your question, Jeremy.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.060]   Hope you're doing well.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:32.180]   I guess I would say on the first part of the question,
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:38.460]   sort of obviously ConEd has local knowledge of New York
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:42.660]   and their service territory and the network and the operation
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:48.820]   of the transmission and delivery system that are valuable
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.980]   to any party if you're operating in New York.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:59.260]   So I'd say they bring a knowledge and skill set of the area
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:05.300]   that certainly we don't have as depth of knowledge as they would,
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:11.980]   so a certain skill set there that the local player would bring.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:17.020]   So in terms of what the components
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:22.180]   of a relationship would be, those things are all to be discussed
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.420]   as we move through, but it's certainly beneficial, I think,
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:32.900]   to the project and have somebody with ConEd skill sets involved.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:41.900]   >> Got it, and as far as potential ownership interests,
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.380]   is there any kind of thoughts on how that could develop?
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:50.020]   >> Not at this time, no.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.260]   >> Got it.
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:55.020]   And then, will the delay in offshore wind permitting have any
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.060]   impact on the current financing plans?
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.620]   Is it fair to assume the 700 million of equity
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.820]   in your current private plan moves to the back end here
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.620]   and how is offshore wind catbacks spending track Peter Day versus
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:13.460]   the 300 to 400 million range that you expected?
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.780]   >> We haven't disclosed a range that we've expected.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.660]   We've talked about how much we expected to spend, you know,
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:28.540]   this year, you know, you know, just for the year 2020,
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.860]   and it's tracking somewhat close
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.580]   that I'd say is probably a little bit under what we expected
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.460]   at this time.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:43.060]   In terms of the financing, you're right that we announced a year
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.300]   ago, you know, this $2 billion of equity need
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:51.100]   that would support the forecast, and we issued 1.3 of that,
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:57.340]   so this 700 million remaining that, and I would say the same
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.260]   thing as I've said all along as we'd be opportunistic
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.260]   and consider what our capital forecasts are
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.940]   and what the market conditions are, you know,
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.540]   as we look to fulfill the rest of that offering
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.900]   that we discussed.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:16.900]   >> Got it, that's helpful.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.500]   I'll leave it there.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.580]   Thank you.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.340]   >> Great, thanks, Jeremy.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.860]   Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.580]   Good morning, Paul.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.020]   >> Good morning, guys.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.540]   >> Good morning, Paul.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:33.740]   >> I just wanted to follow up on the draft decision
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:39.580]   in Connecticut on Monday, and what your thoughts were on it.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.620]   Any -- if it were, in fact, to become a final order,
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.860]   what the potential impact could be?
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:53.740]   >> Are you talking about the draft information on rates
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.820]   or what -- can you be more specific?
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.780]   >> Sure, there was a draft decision on Monday
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:04.220]   in the PERA case associated with the rates, right,
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.820]   the rate review that was reversed, that proceeding.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.180]   I can tell you the specific name.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.300]   >> No, that's okay.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.300]   I just wanted to -- I just wanted to be specific
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.740]   because as somebody else mentioned,
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.900]   there's been a number of different --
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.740]   >> Yeah, I can measure a lot.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.540]   >> So this -- so as you recall, we --
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.540]   the PERA suspended the rates that we had implemented
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:36.620]   over the summer, both we and UI, to take an additional look.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.460]   I think this is what you're referring to.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.260]   So we did receive the draft order,
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.220]   and really it's kind of hot off the press
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:48.580]   with currently evaluating that, and we're going to, you know,
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.180]   see what comments we might have
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.020]   and comments on the draft could do.
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.980]   I think it's the 12th of November,
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.100]   so we have some time to flush out anything.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.300]   But it's consistent with --
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.700]   on first blush, I'd say, it's consistent
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:10.180]   with the purest desire to have some rate changes.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.420]   You know, move -- instead of implementing rates
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.660]   at peak times of usage, maybe such as July,
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.740]   implement them on -- you know, change the time limit
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.540]   to implement it maybe in a shoulder month,
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:27.380]   like May or something, and move to annual reconciliations
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.340]   as opposed to semi-annual.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:34.620]   So this would, you know, if there's delay,
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:38.500]   this could have -- effectively, this is a cash flow item,
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:43.060]   and it could have an impact on our deferrals
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.860]   that we have in place there.
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.860]   But, you know, I think it's generally consistent
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.860]   with the desire, as we said, to move off of these peak periods
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.220]   for making rate changes into shoulder periods
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.820]   and see what we go from there.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.300]   But we're actively reviewing that last night and today,
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.540]   and we will be -- and have any comments
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.620]   that we would have to do, as I said, on the 12th.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.740]   >> Okay. There was one part of it
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.220]   that would reduce the carrying charges from the --
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.140]   from lack to a prime rate on a variety
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:21.580]   of reconciliation mechanisms.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.780]   Is there any -- do we have any --
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.220]   I know this is off the press and everything,
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.260]   but do we have any sort of forecast as to what the --
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.980]   those reconciliation mechanisms --
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.380]   like how much capital might be tied up in those?
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:44.900]   >> No, that is a point to the carrying cost at prime,
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:49.220]   which is consistent in some of the jurisdictions, I guess.
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:55.260]   So, no, it's not a significant, you know, item,
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:59.580]   but it's certainly one that Pure had put out there
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.580]   in the draft is to recover the deferred balances
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:07.860]   with a prime rate versus a lack.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.420]   >> Okay. And then just --
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.220]   we don't know who the president's going to be at the same,
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.420]   but if there was a change in administration,
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:22.740]   do you think that could have or not have maybe a significant impact
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:29.940]   on the B O E M permitting process with respect to offshore wind?
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.540]   >> The permitting process, I mean, when we meet
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:40.260]   with all the B O E M, you know, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.780]   you know, that people are active, we're actively working,
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:48.260]   we're actively having, you know, Zoom meetings or team calls
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:56.380]   or whatever the video capabilities are that we're using.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.740]   But, you know, we're actively working that and I can assure you
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:04.460]   that the people in the agencies are working full speed regardless
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:08.740]   of, you know, who's, you know, president
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.860]   or what the election results are.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:14.420]   But certainly, it would be good to have, you know,
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:15.500]   the results of the election.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.900]   And I think we've all, as a country, you know,
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.060]   that the election results are something
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.580]   that we've all targeted out there and wherever you fall
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:29.780]   on the political spectrum, it's good to have certainty
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.980]   as opposed to uncertainty.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.500]   So I think we're all looking forward
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:37.140]   to what the final outcome is there so we can move forward.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.740]   >> Okay. That's just so -- for my clarity,
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.180]   the process of the B O E M is pretty much the agency
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.780]   of the sort of bureaucratic process that's going on.
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.300]   Really, you don't see a significant change one way
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.740]   or the other regardless of the outcome
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.020]   of the presidential election.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.860]   Is that the right understanding there?
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.700]   >> Yeah, I'd say that the work
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.900]   at the agencies is going on, you know, there, you know,
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:06.780]   we've been meeting regularly, going through questions.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:10.420]   We're working through the various state agencies.
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.900]   So no, I'd say that the work is continuing at the,
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:18.380]   as you say, the bureaucrat level.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.580]   >> Okay. Awesome.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.820]   Thanks so much.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.100]   >> You're welcome.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.740]   >> Next question is from Mike Weinstein
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.740]   from Credit Suisse.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.420]   Good morning, Mike.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.860]   >> Hey, good morning.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:31.380]   Morning, Phil.
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.220]   >> Good morning, Mike.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.020]   >> All right, good.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.580]   I hope you're doing well.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.620]   Hey, maybe you could just give a quick two-second update
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.820]   on what you think the outcome at FERC might be
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.740]   for transmission ROEs, you know, considering, I don't know,
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.260]   if the election outcome maybe has any effect
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:55.740]   on any of this accelerating an outcome?
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:59.260]   >> Well, Mike, that's a very big crystal ball
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.460]   that you're asking.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:05.980]   So, but again, thanks and I hope you're doing well.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.420]   Thanks for your question.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:12.700]   You know, it's-- I wish I had a, you know, a better answer
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.660]   than to say that, you know, it's working its way through.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:25.700]   We don't really have a specific clarity as to when FERC might,
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.100]   you know, come up with something on the New England before
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:33.700]   pending New England cases and showing the impact
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.900]   of the election one way or the other, what that could have
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.100]   in terms of commissioners and that type of thing.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:45.180]   So, you know, the only thing I know for certain is we're looking
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:55.100]   at our 10.57 rates and observing to that level and an 11.74 cap
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.900]   and, you know, we'll just have to wait and see what the final,
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.100]   the final outcome we'll look at.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:04.300]   But I don't really have any answer.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.940]   I know in years past when I tried to think that one was coming
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:13.220]   or it was going a certain way, it really hasn't materialized.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.460]   So, I think it's best to wait until the final order comes
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.220]   out at this point on board or as it may be.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:25.780]   >> Right. And a bigger crystal ball question would be, you know,
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:30.060]   I know that Hydro Quebec has a pretty big long term construction
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:33.300]   plan for, you know, hydro generation up there.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:36.060]   And I know that their long term plans included lots
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.860]   and lots of Northern past type transmission lines.
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.500]   You know, do you think there's ever a time at some point
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.660]   where there might be another whack or another go
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.100]   at transmission at some point, you know,
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.100]   a big transmission project?
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.500]   >> I think a lot of that is dependent
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.780]   upon what the states want to get, right?
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.540]   So, these are going to be processes now that are driven
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:01.900]   by states clean energy policies and the states desire
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:11.140]   to have either offshore wind or solar or hydro in the mix.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:16.540]   So, you know, there are certainly, there's a lot of activity
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.260]   at the states now.
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:24.460]   I mean the states in our area all want aggressive carbon reduction
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:28.140]   targets so it wouldn't be out of the question to see a state,
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:31.940]   you know, want to, you know, contract for more of that
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.260]   but there's nothing planned on our end.
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.900]   There's nothing that I see at this stage on the states agenda
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.940]   that would say that but when you say the word ever,
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.700]   you know, that's a long time.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.060]   >> So it seems like the offshore wind program really is kind
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.980]   of supplanted that, at least for the time being.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:55.740]   >> Yeah, I think that's a good way of looking at it.
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:58.180]   >> Okay, great, thank you very much.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:59.780]   >> Okay, thanks Mike.
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:03.580]   Our next question is from INSU Kim from Goldman Sachs.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.620]   Good morning INSU.
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.620]   >> Good morning guys.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.580]   My only question is, and apologies if I miss this
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:13.900]   but could you give just an update on the Connecticut grid mark filings
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:17.580]   and any updates on expected decisions from the commission
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:21.220]   and, you know, timing of investments, et cetera?
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:23.460]   >> Thanks for your question too and I hope you
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.900]   and your family are doing well.
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:26.940]   You didn't miss it.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:32.500]   I mentioned, you know, in terms of what items could be additive
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:36.460]   to our 5% to 7% core business growth rate.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:40.700]   I alluded to grid mark in Connecticut or New Hampshire
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:49.420]   or potentially additional AMI dockets in Massachusetts
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.420]   but there's really been no change there.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:57.820]   All the parties filed comments and plans back in July
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:01.340]   and certainly you can understand there's been a lot going on
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.940]   and I think I may have said East IEIS was in October
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:10.540]   but we all know that East IEIS was in August so since August
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:14.460]   there's been a lot of, you know, there's been a lot of focus
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:17.180]   on storms and there's been a lot of dockets
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:21.620]   and as somebody else mentioned we have dockets going on in terms
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:24.780]   of moratoriums and whatnot.
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.700]   So this, you know, the expectation was there was going
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:32.540]   to be another sort of go round and another process
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.780]   in Connecticut towards the end of the year.
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.340]   I really haven't seen anything
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:41.500]   that would indicate a specific schedule, you know, on that
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.860]   so I guess our best guess is still, you know,
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.820]   it's still in the pipeline and you may see more activity
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:51.340]   on grid mark there in Connecticut
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:54.780]   as we move over the next several months.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:59.540]   But in terms of being in our forecast, you know,
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:04.060]   I want to be clear that there is currently no, you know, zero,
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:08.420]   there's no grid mark spending in our capital forecast
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.860]   for any, you know, grid mark programs
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:14.700]   that haven't been approved like in Connecticut or New Hampshire
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.300]   so, you know, once they are approved
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.980]   and once we see what our role would be in them
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:25.740]   and once we see what that, you know, looks like then we have more
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.900]   confidence in putting in the plan.
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.700]   So that could be something we have information on
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:35.020]   by the time we get to the February update.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:41.140]   So, you know, we'll have to stay tuned on that.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.140]   >> That makes sense.
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:42.940]   That's all I had.
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.660]   Thank you, guys, and stay safe.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.820]   >> All right, you do.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:46.620]   Thanks, Andrew.
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:48.980]   Next question is from David Arkaro
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:50.140]   from Morgan Stanley.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.980]   Morning, David.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:52.820]   >> Morning. Hi, Jeff.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:55.620]   Hi, Phil. Thanks so much for taking my question.
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:56.940]   >> Thank you.
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:01.300]   >> And a quick follow-up on offshore wind, you know,
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.940]   in light of some of the recent delays, I was wondering
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:07.780]   if that changes how you're strategizing around other bids
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:12.020]   that you're putting into future RFPs like baking
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:15.460]   and more contingency, anything that might give a greater level
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.260]   of comfort around the economic future projects
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.660]   that you might win.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.660]   >> Thank you, David, for your comment, and I hope you
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.460]   and your family are doing well.
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:31.340]   Certainly, every piece of information that you get,
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:34.260]   you know, and this isn't just offshore wind, you know,
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.540]   this is, you know, on all our business,
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.420]   but I'll focus on offshore wind since that's the question.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.980]   You know, every month it goes by, every quarter it goes by,
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:48.580]   we gain more insight and information about construction,
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:53.860]   about, you know, rates about, you know,
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:54.900]   lots of factors.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.220]   If all of those things, all of those things are factored
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:01.540]   into subsequent bids, so the information
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.620]   that we have available to us, you know,
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:07.740]   as we're moving into a bid, a recent bid in New York is different
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.740]   than we had from bids that we made, you know,
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.940]   in Rhode Island or Connecticut or Massachusetts.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:16.740]   So every data point is important to us
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.980]   and we factor that into the next bid.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:25.140]   So I'd say that absolutely that schedules and how you make it
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:30.780]   through the fighting process and all of that informs, you know,
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:34.140]   subsequent bids, and so I can assure you
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:39.140]   that all those things get, you know, up to the minute attention
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:42.260]   before bid goes in.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.540]   >> Okay, got it.
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:47.260]   That's helpful and I just wanted to touch on just O&M costs
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.660]   and the O&M budget.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.660]   Could you remind us how you see that trajectory just
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.540]   for the overall business going forward?
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:58.100]   You've got a great track record of controlling O&M,
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:03.260]   so what are the key levers in your tool belt?
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:09.340]   So that you would focus on going forward for managing O&M.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:13.740]   >> Certainly, you know, we've got people processing technology,
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:17.660]   right, so all those things are levers to help, you know,
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.940]   our capital program as well as our operating program.
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:28.220]   So, you know, we continue to implement systems and technology
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:33.420]   that improves processes that makes it more efficient
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.180]   and effective work force.
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:41.020]   So we have, you know, still a robust, I'd say,
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:44.220]   series of technology improvements.
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:48.620]   If you -- I'll start off by just setting this page.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:52.620]   In the guidance we gave, we said that we expected O&M costs
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:55.100]   to be, you know, down this year and then just
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:58:00.700]   for the forecast period kind of flat going forward.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.260]   So how are we able to do that?
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:07.060]   It is by some of these technology changes
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:11.340]   and we've been implementing more productivity management tools
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:14.300]   and tools for our, you know, individual line workers
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:18.260]   and gas bidders and in the field to get their work,
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:22.140]   to update their work that we can then take that
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:25.060]   and automatically update drawings and files.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.900]   We don't need, you know, to hand it off to somebody.
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:32.980]   So there's still these productivity technology changes
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.220]   that are happening.
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:36.740]   Some went in last year, some going in this year
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.500]   and more planned for next.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:44.820]   So that will be, I'd say, the lever underpinning for us
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:48.340]   to have the ability to continue to improve processes
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:53.940]   and take unheeded costs out of the business.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.460]   >> Okay, great.
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:54.940]   That's helpful.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.860]   Thanks so much for the call.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:57.380]   >> You're welcome.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.380]   >> Thank you, David.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:03.140]   Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar.
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:04.740]   Morning, Travis.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:05.260]   >> Good morning.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.780]   Thank you.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.940]   Quick clarification on the storm costs.
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:14.380]   That $275 million number, if I heard you correctly.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.140]   How much did you expense in the quarter
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:20.900]   and how much was either deferred or capitalized
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:24.740]   or will be pending that the regulatory filing
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.380]   that you mentioned?
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:32.700]   >> Travis, that amount that you repeated was deferred.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:36.340]   That's how much of a storm cost that we deferred
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:40.940]   in the tropical storm, East IES.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:46.540]   And that was across all states but primarily in Connecticut.
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:48.140]   So that's our deferral.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:52.340]   That would be, you know, once a storm gets to a certain level,
[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:54.060]   it triggers a deferral.
[00:59:54.060 --> 01:00:00.140]   So we -- that fall is deferred storm cost right now.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.660]   In terms of -- there are other storms.
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:07.540]   Certainly, we had an active quarter for storms in general
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:10.940]   but there are other storms other than East IES
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.940]   that did impact the quarter.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.180]   I mean, our storm costs were up, you know,
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.740]   about $10 million for the quarter
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.820]   that went through, you know, our O&M.
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:24.780]   So, you know, for the quarter, it's at that level
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:29.940]   and then the 274 or 5 that you mentioned is deferred
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:32.220]   across the system.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:32.860]   >> Okay, great.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:33.900]   That's very helpful.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:34.820]   Thank you.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.220]   And then a quick follow-up to the discussion
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.140]   on the Connecticut legislation.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.980]   And there's some language in there, as I understood it,
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:46.820]   about the General Assembly having some review power there.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.820]   What's your thought in terms of the scope
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:53.500]   of what the General Assembly, separate from Pura, could do
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.140]   in terms of either taking back some earnings
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.220]   or rate changes, stuff like that,
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:04.100]   separate from what's going on in the Pura?
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:08.340]   >> Well, certainly the General Assembly can enact legislation
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:12.980]   that it feels is appropriate in any matter.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.940]   So, you know, I do think specifically
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:21.660]   to the energy legislation that was enacted recently
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.780]   in Connecticut that most, you know,
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:29.860]   things all were, you know, for the most part moved to Pura,
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.060]   you know, so the regulator.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:36.300]   So, I guess I'd look at it as the legislation would provide
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.140]   the intent, the framework, the direction,
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.340]   and then Pura is the one who's going to be implementing,
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.340]   you know, they're going to be the ones
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.500]   who evaluate the performance-based rates.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:51.260]   They'll be the ones who initiate the storm, you know,
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.020]   standards and things like that, and look at, you know,
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:58.820]   should there be penalties or should there be food,
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.980]   you know, penalties and things like that?
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.500]   So, I think that effectively, you know,
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.300]   the General Assembly can certainly enact any
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:12.540]   and all legislation it feels it should,
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.300]   and the way that this legislation seems to have turned
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.460]   out was that any implementation
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:23.060]   of that legislation is in the hands of Pura.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:26.260]   >> Okay. So, the potential for any or the risk for any kind
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.140]   of clawbacks would likely go through Pura instead of going
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.460]   through the General Assembly based on that cannot
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:34.580]   to get legislation that you talked about.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.460]   >> Right.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.340]   >> Yeah, as I say, you know, the Pura, the dockets are active
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.060]   in -- will be active over, you know,
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:49.180]   there's a certain time date that the legislation has given Pura,
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:54.260]   so I would expect that Pura will have the pen on this,
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:58.100]   but again, as I say, you know, legislation can always be
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:01.820]   enacted in any area.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.100]   >> Yeah, okay.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.300]   Great, appreciate.
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.020]   >> All right, thank you Travis.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:12.980]   Our next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.380]   Good morning, Andrew.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.420]   >> Hey, good morning.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.220]   Thanks for squeezing me in.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.780]   First question is, with the two rate cases now completed,
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.020]   can you remind us which subsidiaries might be next
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.700]   to file general rate cases?
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.620]   We have plenty of regulatory items, of course,
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.100]   with grid mod and other initiatives,
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.100]   but for general rate cases?
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:41.060]   >> Well, according to the requirements in Connecticut,
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:46.100]   Connecticut could be an area that is required to file
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:50.100]   by the existing framework that's there.
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.940]   And that would be something that would be sort of a,
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.780]   you know, next year sort of event, but other than that,
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:03.300]   we're pretty much out of the regulatory arena.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.620]   >> Okay, great.
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:09.260]   Then on offshore winds, can you just thinking, sorry,
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.660]   can you share your latest thinking
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:13.700]   on how big you're willing to let that business get?
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.540]   You talked a lot about the opportunities
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.460]   that you're pursuing beyond the three existing projects.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.540]   Any thinking as far as from an earnings mix perspective,
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:27.260]   if there's a limitation or will you plan to just bid, bid, bid
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.780]   and get as many projects as your leases will support?
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.420]   >> Well, I want to be clear on this
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.700]   because I think it's a very important point
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:39.140]   that bid isn't our strategy.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:43.300]   Our strategy is to have a financial discipline
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.140]   about growing that business in a way
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.300]   that provides appropriate levels of returns
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.700]   that benefit our shareholders.
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:55.340]   So just by winning a bid, you know, doesn't do it.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.940]   It has to be -- we have to and we continue
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:00.620]   to maintain financial discipline in terms
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:03.580]   of the amounts that we bid and the returns
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.860]   that we're looking for.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:09.940]   So as long as the returns are at an appropriate level
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:14.820]   for that business, it makes sense to make the bid,
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:19.940]   win the bid and expand the business there.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:25.580]   What we've said is our tracks, what we own off the coast
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:29.660]   of what we have access to in terms of the lease areas,
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.180]   you know, we could do about 4,000,
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.540]   at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.020]   So there's kind of a, you know,
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:40.420]   that's the maximum capability that we have
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:44.420]   so it's not an infinite growth type of thing
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:49.420]   and we had indicated that when leases were available
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.540]   that they're not in our region
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.620]   and we were not interested in them.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.100]   So leases in our region, like the ones we're involved in are good
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.420]   but other lease areas, you know, that's not for us
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.340]   in other parts of the mid-Atlantic, et cetera.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:07.500]   So it's -- we're constrained by the lease area
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:11.100]   and we're guided by the financial discipline
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:16.460]   to -- on our bids and our returns.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.540]   >> Got it, that's really helpful.
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.460]   I guess I should have said bid-bid-bid responsibly.
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.300]   >> Okay, well, yeah.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.340]   >> Thank you so much, guys.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.900]   >> Work with, I hope you stay well, I'm just saying.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.460]   >> All right, Andrew, thank you very much.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.380]   That sort of wraps up today.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:37.060]   If you have any follow-up questions, please give us a call
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.380]   or send us an e-mail and we look forward to speaking
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:45.500]   and seeing many of you during the virtual EEI conference next week.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.500]   >> And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.060]   This concludes today's conference.
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:56.100]   Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.420]   >> Thank you.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.740]   >> All right.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.060]   >> Thanks.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SAG 3rd quarter 2020
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at the time. If
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star 0 on your touchstone telephone.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Thank you. I would like to turn the
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   conference over to your host, Mr. Brandon Freight. Please go ahead.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Thank you, Grace. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review SAG's 3rd quarter 2020 financial results.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   On the call today, we have Krista Herm, Chief Executive Officer and Taylor Smith, Chief Financial Officer.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Following Chris and Taylor's prepared comments, we will open the call for a question and answer session.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Our 3rd quarter earnings press release was issued today after the market closed at approximately
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   05 p.m. Eastern Time. As a follow-on to the earnings release, we published a supplemental financial
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   information on our Investor Relations website. We also furnished this document to the SEC
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   on Formation. You can find all our earnings documents on our Investor Relations website
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   at Zag.com in the quarterly results section under the financial tab. We are recording this call
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and a podcast of the conference call will be archived at the Zag Investor Relations webpage
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   under the Events tab for one year. Before we begin, we would like to remind everyone that the
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, and management may make additional forward-looking
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   statements in response to your questions. These statements include, but are not limited to,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   our outlook for the company and statements that estimate or project future results of operations
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   for the performance of the company. These statements do not guarantee future performance and speak
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   as of the date hereof. For more detailed discussion on the factors that can cause actual results
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, we refer all
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   of you to the risk factors contained in Zag's annual report on Form 10(k) and quarterly reports
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   on Form 10(q) by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Zag assumes no obligation to revise
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   any forward-looking statements that may be made in today's release or call. Please note that
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   on today's call, in addition to discussing the GAP financial results, we will discuss
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   adjusted EBITDA non-GAP financial measure. Explanation of Zag's use of this non-GAP financial
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   measure in this call and reconciliation between GAP and non-GAP measures required by SEC Regulation
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   G is included in Zag's press release today, which again can be found on the Investor Relations
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   website. The non-GAP information is not a substitute for any performance measure derived in accordance
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   with GAP and the use of such non-GAP measures has limitations, which are detailed in the
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   company's press release. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Christopher Herman. Chris?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Thanks, Brendan. And thank you to everyone on today's call. We hope you and your families
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   continue to be safe and healthy. Firstly, let me start by thanking our entire Zag team
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   across the globe. I'm extremely proud to see how our teams reacted through the quarter
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and never last sight of serving our consumers and partners with quality products that protect
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   and enhance their devices. Over the course of the third quarter, it was pleasing to see our
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   results improve significantly compared with the second quarter and exceed our expectations.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   We are encouraged by our recent performance given the challenges we continue to face from
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy. Our work over the past several
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   months, which has included reducing expenses, adapting our operations to the current retail
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   environment, and aggressively managing inventories has put the company in a much stronger financial
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   position and provided the business with good momentum as we head into our busiest selling season.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Looking at our third quarter in more detail, as we discussed on our Q2 call in August, we saw
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   a significant sequential uptake in sales through in June for both our protection and power
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   categories, as several of our larger customers reopened our doors and resumed more normalised store
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   operations, with some sales through weeks even exceeding last year's levels. This trend continued
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   into July and consistently improved throughout August and September. While our online sales growth
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   did temper a bit from levels we experienced earlier in the pandemic, when much of the brick and
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   mortar was closed, it was still up nicely from a year ago and expanding this channel continues
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   to be a priority for us. With respect to overall performance, Q3 revenue came in at $150 million
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   compared to $147 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 21%. This represents a nice improvement
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   from the 28% year-over-year decrease in revenue we reported in the second quarter. Despite the roughly
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   32 million drop in revenue compared with the third quarter last year, combined with some gross
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   margin headwinds from higher freight expenses, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $15 million.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Thanks to cost-saving measures, we enacted early in the pandemic. Taylor will go through in greater
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   detail on the balance sheet, but I wanted to share a few highlights. Despite significant market
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   pressure from COVID-19, our account receivable, DSO has improved compared to last year. In venturi
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   decline compared to where we ended Q2, we generated positive operating cash flow, and we continued
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   to reduce our quarterly net-dead balance on a year-over-year and sequential basis. By taking
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   quick decisive action back in April and more recently working closely with our retail partners
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   under store reopening efforts, we have been able to successfully navigate through incredibly
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   challenging market conditions, ensuring the financial viability of the company, and position
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   ourselves to exit this difficult period as a stronger, more nimble organization.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I'll now provide some additional color to our categories. Starting with protection, we
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   continue to build on our overall digital wellness strategy. For a few years now, our hero screen
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   protector has been VisionGuard, a product that reduced exposure to high-energy visible blue
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   light that can have damaging effects without changing the screen colors or the peak resolution.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   We have now sold over 10 million units with this technology. In addition, all invisible
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   screen protectors produced this year and beyond now also include antimicrobial technology. This
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   includes our entire lineup for the new iPhone 12, which is now available in stores. Earlier
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   this year, we introduced our newest product geared towards our digital wellness strategy,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   a UV phone sanitizer, which works with all mobile devices and kills up to 99.9% of staff
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   in E. coli surface bacteria. Our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   with retailers and our consumers, and has led to increasing sell-through and greater shell
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   space with many of our accounts. We've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to protect
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   cases with good success, starting with the Samsung Galaxy S20 launch earlier this year,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   and right through to the recent iPhone 12 launch. All Gear 4 protective cases now also feature
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   antimicrobial technology. The combination of disenhancement, benefit, and Gear 4's differential
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   D3O impact technology is driving excitement amongst consumers, especially as awareness
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   of the brand and products grow from our efforts to expand distribution. With the new iPhone
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   12, Gear 4 is now available and growing across all of our carrier partners. This expanded
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   distribution accelerates the momentum of Gear 4 brand, and I'm excited to see it continue
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   to grow through 2021. In our power category, Morphe launched many exciting new products during
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Q3, including the introduction of a new line of wireless charging solutions. These innovations
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple devices in one central location.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   In addition, last month we launched the new Morphe Juice Pack Connect. This new product
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   represents an evolution of our popular juice pack, allowing users to easily charge their
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   phone on demand using a detachable battery feature that is not device specific and is used
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   with or without the consumer's normal phone case. Our Halo brand continues to perform well
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   on QVC, which has been a productive partnership and channel, particularly given the number
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   of consumers spending more time at home. Q4 is a busy time for our brands with QVC and
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   HSN, with a number of earrings planned during the holiday period. Looking ahead with the
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   majority of our U.S. partner doors now open and weekly sales will continue to improve, combined
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   with solid direct-to-consumer trends, we feel optimistic about our prospects for the remainder
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   of the year. While there is still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   shopping behavior this holiday season, including the effect on several countries in Europe that
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   have recently implemented lockdowns, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on demand
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   regardless of which channel our consumer chooses to engage with the brands. We are currently
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   planning four-quarter revenue to increase from third-quarter levels and continue improving
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   on the year-over-year declines we have experienced the past two quarters, even as we are facing
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   tough comparisons to last year's record Q4 sales. I am confident in the long-term course we
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   have set for the company. Our efforts around antimicrobial UV sanitization and blue light
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   protection are driven by our belief that consumers will increasingly look for solutions that will
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   hinch their digital wellness. We also believe another consumer priority will be increased
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   productivity and comfort from home. We will continue our focus on enhancing technology in
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   our lives to accomplish these growing needs. While it remains difficult to know when conditions
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   will fully normalize and what impact COVID-19 will have on the global economy and our industry,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I am confident that we have taken the right steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   company. This includes our decision to discontinue certain lower-margin product and categories
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   and simplify our core lines of business. As a more nimble company, Zac can better serve
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   its retail partners and co-consumers, capitalize on the tailwinds from the multi-year rollout of 5G
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   with the margin benefits from our branding category consolidation and generate increased value
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   for our shareholders. I will now hand the call over to Taylor.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Thanks Chris. Since many details of our quarterly financial performance were included in the
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   supplemental financial information issued earlier today, I would just like to take a few minutes
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   to add some additional comments on our third quarter financial performance. Q3 net sales
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   decreased year-over-year by approximately 21% to $115 million. After exiting a very difficult
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   second quarter, we saw good momentum throughout the third quarter as retail outlets continued
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   to reopen and allow a more normal in-store shopping experience. That being said, the residual
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   effects of COVID-19 combined with the delay of the launch of the new Apple devices, which
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   pushed some orders into Q4, made it a difficult year-over-year compare. Overall, we are pleased
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   with the momentum and sell-through improvements we saw at retail, which enabled us to increase
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   sales by almost 50% on a consecutive quarter basis from $77 million to $115 million.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Q3 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased year-over-year to 33%. There were
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   a number of puts and takes that impacted gross profit during the quarter, including a benefit
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   from net lower duty rates and expected duty refunds, which I'll discuss in more detail
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   in a second. This benefit was offset by higher expedited air freight and increased air freight
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   rates along with the sale of excess inventory at margins that were lower than our historical
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   averages. On the subjects of duty refunds, in early August, we received an exclusion notice
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   that duties paid on certain products imported from China starting in late 2018 may be subject
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   to refund. We worked closely with our customs broker to begin submitting refund documentation
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   to U.S. Customs. This work is ongoing, and given the volume of imports from China since
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   late 2018, we'll continue throughout the fourth quarter. Based on the work completed to date,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   we recorded a refund receivable at a quarter end of approximately $5.4 million for duties
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   paid that we expect to be refunded. The income statement impacted this receivable offset
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   by the balance sheet reduction from duties previously capitalized in inventory and then sold in Q3
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   2020 was a net income statement benefit of $1.7 million or approximately 140 basis points
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   to gross profit margin during the quarter. As I mentioned, there is still quite a bit of
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   work left to do during the fourth quarter to complete our remaining refund submissions
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   and we'll provide an update on any additional refund upside on our next call.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Q3 operating expenses decreased 29% or approximately $12 million compared to last year. The decrease
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   was due primarily to the various cost-cutting measures we implemented as a result of the
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   expected COVID-19 impacts on demand. Over the last several months, we've made the conscious
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   decision to bring some individuals back from furlough to support fourth quarter product launches
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   and customer care, but we continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   through this difficult time. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million versus 21 million in the prior
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   period. The decline versus last year is linked to decreased sales and reduction in overall
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   gross profit margin for the reasons I mentioned. These items were offset by the decreases in
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   operating expenses that I just discussed. Turning to the balance sheet, compared to a year ago
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   accounts receivable decreased 33% to $91 million due to the reduction in sales compared to the
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   prior year period. However, our DSOs improved significantly from 87 days to 73 days. The
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   quality of our receivables remains very good. Inventory was $80 million compared to $94 million
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   at the end of the first quarter, a reduction of approximately $14 million. During the third
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   quarter, we took a conservative approach to inventory as we closely monitored retail sell-through,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   customer forecasts, and customer inventory levels to ensure we didn't overextend on inventory
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   purchasing. As a result, we did incur some incremental expedited air freight charges due
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   to increased demand at the end of the third quarter as retail sell-through improved. At
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   this point, we will continue to closely monitor the factors that influence our purchasing
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   forecasts, but we will continue to plan conservatively due to the continued uncertainties related to
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continued headwinds from COVID-19 during the quarter,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   we generated a third quarter operating cash flow of approximately $9 million compared to
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   cash from operations during the prior year period. Net debt, which is consolidated debt less cash,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   decreased to $81 million compared to $97 million in Q3 last year and $85 million at the end
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   of the first quarter of 2020. As we discussed on the last call, during April, we amended
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   our credit facility to increase the total amount available under the line of credit from $125
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   million to $145 million. This expansion combined with the loan received under the CARES Act,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   the Q2 restructuring, and cost-cutting initiatives we've undertaken gives us confidence that we'll
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   successfully navigate the headwinds that COVID-19 has put on the business. The capital allocation
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   focused throughout the remainder of 2020 will remain on funding working capital needs and
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   continuing to service our line of credit. As we look to the fourth quarter of 2020, we
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   definitely have better visibility now than we did when we last spoke in August. However,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty around worldwide retail demand. Given this market
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   uncertainty, we will not be providing annual guidance at this time. However, given our current
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   view of customer orders and positive retail sell-through trends, we expect strong sequential
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth over the third quarter. We expect 2020 year-to-day gross
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   margins to improve during the fourth quarter, though as I mentioned, we'll see some pressure
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   over the next few quarters compared to historical averages of mid-30s as we sell through our
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   excess inventory. We expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high 20s
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   to low $30 million for the fourth quarter. No different than from many other companies,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   COVID-19 has been extremely disruptive to our business. However, with the steps we've taken
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   to restructure the business, reduce fixed costs, and ensure adequate liquidity, I'm confident
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   the likes of this period impacted by COVID-19 is a much stronger company than when we entered.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   With that, we will now open up the call for questions.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. If you have a question at this time, please press start
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   in the number one key on your touch-tone telephone. Again, that is start in the number one key
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   on your touch-tone telephone. Your first question comes from the line of Elliott Alper from
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   DA Davidson, your line is open.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Great, thank you. So thanks for the info on just the sequential sales in the fourth quarter,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   I guess. Could you talk about any trends quarter date specifically and specifically
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   makes or you seeing any material changes with sales and geographies that have lost restrictions
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   compared to those that have more?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Yeah, just a couple of notes. With the Apple launch happening a little bit later than we
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   had experienced previously, there was maybe $5 million of sales that shifted from Q3 into
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Q4, which obviously benefit kind of the sequential look at revenue. Overall though, we're seeing
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   really good sell through of the phones that seem to be doing very successful in market
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   and obviously we're benefiting from that. So Q4 is starting off really, really well. In terms
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   of geos, no material change in geoexpansion, Chris mentioned or GeoMix, Chris mentioned
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   on his prepared remarks that we are definitely seeing some headwinds, at least in terms of
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   shutdowns and some of our internal devices.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And some of our international locations. However, the wireless dealers in those locations have
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   been deemed as essential and so those have remained open. And so it remains to be seen as to how
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   that's going to impact demand. But I think overall, we're definitely seeing some strong
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   signs that we're kind of getting back to a more normal Q4 experience. Though obviously
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   COVID remains a bit of a cloud over everything.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Okay, great. And then aside from the Apple launch shifting into the fourth quarter, can
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   you talk about the holiday season and kind of what may be different this year versus historically
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and kind of any implications that may have on the December quarter?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Yeah, the one thing that we are starting to see is obviously the Black Friday seems to be
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   more, some retailers are taking strategy which are spreading us out over a number of days
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   over the month. So that's something that's going to be different. I think we're still
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   going to see a pretty strong online attachment from both side.com and obviously through Amazon.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   But we're very, I would say, optimistic about the early sales through on our screen protection
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   and cases are quite strong. And that's given that we still have a number of other devices
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   to hit the market actually this week. So overall, I think we have some good runway for the
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   holiday season that is.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Okay, great. Thank you.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Thank you.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Thanks, Elliot.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And once again, in order to ask a question, please press start then the number one on your
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   touchstone telephone. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Dain from Titan Capital
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Management. Your line is open.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Great. Thank you. I was hoping you could put a number on the expediting shipping cost that
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   you incurred in the third quarter just to give us some better idea how much the housing
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   symptoms were.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Yeah, it was between $2 million and $3 million. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   it was a bit of a balancing act with inventory where we're trying to run it down and sell
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   through, picked up at the end. We did have to move quickly and unfortunately resulted
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   in some expedited air freight charges.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   And for the fourth quarter, are you expecting that to reoccur or is it heavy caught up and
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   you feel like you're in a better place now?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Yeah, it's a great question. You know, I think we're still probably chasing a little bit of
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   demand. You know, the one thing that's also kind of impacted us no different than every
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   other company that's importing from overseas is just generally freight rates have increased
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   kind of globally. And so that's also impacted it. But I think there's probably going to be
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   a little bit of that, you know, as I mentioned, it's a bit of a balancing act. We definitely
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   wanted to be careful, you know, given the pandemic and how much inventory we were planning. And
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   you know, fortunately or unfortunately, we've seen some upsides, which is great, but we've
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   had to chase those. And so I think we're probably still chasing a little bit, which will impact
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   some of our Q4 sales and then also obviously the spend on freight.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Right. Also wanted to ask if I could really quickly about the tariff situation. Now with
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   a Biden presidency, I know you've been moving some production out of China. Does that change
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   your view on moving production out of China? Or how are you thinking about this new regime?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Yeah, I think Matt, it doesn't change our strategy. Ultimately, we're looking to diversify across
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   our CM base and make sure that we're setting the company up for continued business. So we're
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   still following the strategy. You know, we've had a very good quarter where we've now successfully
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   have piloted both screen protection and wireless power outside of China. So it gives us that
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   ability to be able to shift our supply chain when needed. Obviously, China is still a big
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   part of our strategy. But what I like is we're not just looking at it from a tariff perspective.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   We're really looking at it from a business continuity perspective.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Great. Thank you both.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Thanks Matt.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Thanks Matt.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Thank you. Once again, in order to ask a question, please press start in the number one on your
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   touchstone telephone.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Gentlemen, I'm showing you for the question at this time. I would like to turn the conference
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   back to Mr. Chris in hearing from any closing remarks.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Thank you. And thank everybody for joining our Q3 earnings report. We look forward to updating
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   you again on Q4. Have a great evening everyone and stay safe.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining.
