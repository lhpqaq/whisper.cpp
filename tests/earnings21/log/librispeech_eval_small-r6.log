[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Monroe Inks Earnings Conference Call
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.960]   for the third quarter fiscal 2020.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.160]   At this time, all participants are on a listen only mode.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.960]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960]   time.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.840]   If anyone should require assistance during the call, please press star 0 on your touchtone
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.840]   phone.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.300]   As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded and may not be reproduced
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.720]   in whole or in part without permission from the company.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.480]   I would now like to introduce Ms. Maureen Mulholland, Senior Vice President, General
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.240]   Counsel and Secretary of Monroe.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.240]   Thank you.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.240]   Please go ahead.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.240]   Thank you.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.040]   Hello everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's call.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.240]   Before we get started, please note that as part of the call this morning, we will be referencing
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:01:02.120]   a presentation that is available on the Investors section of our website at corporate.monroe.com/investors/investorresources.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.320]   If I could draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on slide two of the presentation,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.680]   I'd like to remind participants on this morning's call that our presentation includes some forward-looking
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.320]   statements about Monroe's future performance.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.240]   Federal results may differ materially from those suggested by our comments today.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.040]   The most significant factors that could affect future results are outlined in Monroe's filings
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.960]   with the SEC and in our earnings release.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.320]   The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.560]   whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560]   law.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.800]   Additionally, on today's call, management statements include a discussion of certain non-gap financial
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.000]   measures which are intended to supplement and not be substituted for comparable gap measures.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.200]   Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable gap measures will be included
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.600]   as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.400]   With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer,
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.680]   Brett Tawnton.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.000]   Thank you, Maureen, and good morning, everyone.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.440]   I'll get started today with a brief overview of our third quarter results followed by an
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.520]   update on the progress we've made on our Monroe forward strategy.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.840]   As illustrated on slide three, we reported comps down 0.9 percent in the third quarter
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.400]   as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.040]   In October and the beginning of November, we performed well against difficult comparisons
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.920]   in the prior year.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.480]   Mild weather conditions towards the end of November and in December caused a slowdown
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.920]   across our core northern markets.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.760]   These conditions have continued into January with our comparable store sales down 4 percent
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.720]   during the month.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.140]   We do not like talking about the weather; however, it is impossible to ignore the impact it has
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.140]   on our business.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.420]   While we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter, we are executing well
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.320]   against the areas within our control.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.720]   In particular, we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and our confidence
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.780]   we are on the right path.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.040]   We are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.080]   deliver strong results no matter the external circumstances.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.620]   Moving on to our performance by category in the third quarter, we were down 1 percent
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.440]   year over year in the entire comparable store sales as higher ticket year over year was offset
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.060]   by a decline in tire volume.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.520]   We experienced more normalized retail pricing this quarter and are focused on further refining
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.960]   our tire strategy to drive strength in our largest category.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.160]   Importantly, we are on track to roll out our tire category management and pricing system
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.600]   approach to real-time pricing.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.080]   I'll provide more details on this shortly.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.640]   Turning to our service and repair categories, we saw a 3 percent decline in brakes year over
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.520]   year, falling short of a difficult comparison in the third quarter last year.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.760]   In maintenance, we were flat while front-end shocks were down 1 percent and alignments
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.400]   decline 3 percent year over year.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.960]   Overall, our southern markets outperformed our northern markets as expected given the mild
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.880]   winter weather conditions we faced in this region.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.600]   New stores added $22.7 million in revenue during the quarter, including $20.7 million from
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.840]   recent acquisitions.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.000]   Regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter, we saw a decline of 20 basis
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.520]   points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.120]   store sales, which resulted in higher fixed cost with the percentage of sales.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.280]   Our variable margin on the other hand expanded due to lower year over year material cost
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.880]   as a percentage of sales, while slightly higher than the prior year quarter technician
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.360]   labor as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.880]   This is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.000]   We identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.120]   action to drive improved results.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.280]   We will have additional opportunities to continue to improve results in this area as we implement
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.760]   our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.160]   which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust the changes in demand dynamics without
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.760]   sacrificing sales.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.440]   I now like to turn to the progress we made in our Monroe Forward Strategy beginning with
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.200]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative on slide four.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.060]   This initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.760]   standardized in-store operating procedures, which we call our Monroe Playbook.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.080]   Additionally, we are rebranding select stores to a tire oriented banner where targeted
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.680]   demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.040]   service revenues.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.120]   During the first half of fiscal 2020, we finalized the transformations of our first group of
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.880]   stores, which includes 44 locations in Rochester, New York and Mid-Atlantic, as well as the second
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.160]   group, which includes 43 stores in our southern market.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.600]   During the third quarter, we continued to scale this initiative across our base and moved forward
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.760]   with the transformation of 74 stores in four markets and 42 of our recently acquired California
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.400]   stores.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.000]   We have completed the transformation into 74 stores and have substantially completed our
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.880]   California stores, which are being rebranded under our Tire Choice Auto Service Center
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.080]   banner to drive higher awareness for tires.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.480]   Turning to slide five, I'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.200]   rationale as we transform our store base.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.520]   As many of you know, we operate in two store formats.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.800]   Our service brand stores which generate approximately $600,000 per store in annualized sales and our
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.040]   tire brand stores which generate approximately $1.2 million per store in annualized sales.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.560]   Prior to any rebrand activity, we operated 555 service brand stores and 734 tire brand
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.560]   stores.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.240]   As we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores, we are prioritizing
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.000]   the higher volume tire brand.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.040]   Throughout this process, we will be consolidating our regional brands, focusing on shifting our
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.120]   service brands over the tire brand.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.160]   The lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:01.280]   When we speak to re-imaging stores, this primarily means modernizing the appearance of our stores
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.920]   with no associated brand change.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.040]   As we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re-imaging stores, we are leveraging
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.160]   our analytical model as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.260]   Looking at the bottom left of the slide, you can see here the progress we have made so far.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.420]   We are very much in the early innings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.080]   completed out of our portfolio.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.760]   We separated these stores out between comp stores and non-comp stores which helps us to
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.960]   evaluate their performance post refresh.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.640]   Of our approximately 900 comp stores that we set out to transform, we've completed 134
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:49.280]   stores and of our approximately 150 non-comp stores, we've substantially completed 69.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.120]   As we move forward with expanding this program across our base, we will continue to prioritize
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.780]   markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and our approach
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.680]   will be measured in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.340]   Through the end of this fiscal year we are focusing on finalizing the transformation of our recently
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.960]   acquired California stores while starting the transformation of approximately 80 more stores
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.440]   that will be completed in Q1 of FY21.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.400]   Moving on to the performance of the stores we've completed so far, to help provide some
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.800]   additional granularity, we separated out how rebranded stores have performed versus the
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.680]   stores that have just been re-imaged.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.200]   Unfortunately, this data only includes comp stores that have had a full quarter of performance
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.280]   following the completion of their transformation.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:48.800]   This is how we will speak to this performance of our transformed stores moving forward.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.560]   As you can see and in line with our expectations, we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.560]   stores.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.800]   This shift optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sales without sacrificing
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.840]   our service revenues.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.440]   The stores that have been re-imaged were slightly down as these are located in our northern markets
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.040]   which were impacted by the mild weather conditions I mentioned earlier.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.160]   We believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.560]   to come with a streamlined brand portfolio.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.840]   The 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation, given
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:34.400]   they have not had a full quarter post transformation yet, but we are seeing early signs of strength
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.600]   to these stores and are pleased with the results.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.960]   While we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base, the sustained
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.680]   performance we've seen at the stores that have completed the transformation today underscores
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.200]   the impact of this important initiative.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.440]   Going to slide 6 and the remainder of our Monroe Forward initiatives, I'd like to focus my discussion
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.880]   on the initiatives that are top priority which we believe will be critical to supporting
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.760]   our broader strategy.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.800]   In the third quarter, we began modernizing our store IT infrastructure at all of our approximately
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.360]   1300 locations.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.600]   This new infrastructure enables state-of-the-art technology including our new digital phone
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   and texting system which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.320]   This system will allow us to better track customer execution, drive in a more consistent phone
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.720]   strategy and improve conversions.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.480]   Our store infrastructure modernization will be completed by the end of the first quarter
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.200]   of fiscal 2021 allowing us to leverage our new phone system which will be critical to driving
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.040]   traffic to our stores.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.360]   Another priority for us is the optimization of our entire category management.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.640]   We are on track and by the end of this fiscal year we expect our new pricing software will
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.260]   be operational.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:02.240]   We believe this will be critical to driving long-term margin expansion by providing improved visibility
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.680]   into demand dynamics allowing us to better refine our assortments and execute our strategy to
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.840]   become the number one destination for tires at any price point.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.240]   Currently we are right on track to roll out our cloud-based core scheduling model pilot
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   by year-end.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.600]   Gaining real-time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.360]   and strategic ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales or overstaffed when there
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.640]   is a lack of demand.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.440]   Regarding our other teammate initiatives we have rolled out the Monroe University program
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.720]   to all of our teammates and are continuing to expand and enhance the course content.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.600]   We've also implemented mandatory onboard training to ensure that everyone who joins our team
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:52.920]   is trained on our Monroe playbook operating procedures in order to provide a quality five-star experience
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.120]   to our customers.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.960]   Moving on to slide seven while we are very focused on the rollout of Monroe Forward acquisitions
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.200]   remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.800]   During the quarter we closed the previously announced acquisitions of three companies.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.080]   One with 14 locations in Las Vegas, Nevada and four in Boise, Idaho, as well as two companies
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.280]   that include nine stores in Northern California, further solidifying our growing position in
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.480]   the western United States.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.920]   Our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts as well as benefit
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.360]   from the high concentration of vehicles in this market and a potential long-term consumership
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.080]   to ride sharing.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.920]   The acquisition in Nevada and Idaho, which are new states to Monroe is expected to add
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:44.320]   approximately 20 million in annualized sales represented sales mix of 75% service and 25%
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   tires.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.600]   The acquisitions in California are expected to add approximately 25 million in annualized
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:56.400]   sales represented sales mix of 55% service and 45% tires.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:04.160]   These acquisitions are expected to be diluted to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.080]   All acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent and expected
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.560]   120 million in annualized sales.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.920]   We operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.160]   and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.760]   M&A targets.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.240]   We currently have over 10 NDA signed with opportunities ranging from five to 40 stores
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.760]   which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.640]   while continuing to expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.120]   Further, by continuing to execute our Monroe forward initiatives including our new brand
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.720]   standards and operating procedures, we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   and efficiently.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.560]   Lastly, we open one green field location during third quarter bringing our total green field
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.280]   store openings to 7 in fiscal 2020.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.680]   In conclusion, we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in our
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.680]   business.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.680]   We are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.480]   a platform capable of delivering sustainable long term growth.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:25.360]   We are not there yet nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the transformation
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.040]   but we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business making the
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.920]   appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   our control.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.200]   I'd like to thank the entire team at Monroe for their exceptional work as we execute this
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.760]   strategy as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.040]   With that, I'll turn the call over to our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.680]   Treasurer Brian Deembrosia who will provide additional detail on our third quarter financial performance
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.440]   and fiscal 2020 outlook.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.840]   Thank you, Brett and good morning everyone.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.240]   Turning to slide 8 in our performance during the quarter, sales increased 6.2 percent year
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:15.960]   over year to $329.3 million driven by sales from new stores of $22.7 million including
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:22.040]   $20.7 million from recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.000]   stores of approximately $0.8 million.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.720]   Time store sales in the quarter were down 0.9 percent year over year.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:37.600]   The third quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days in line with the previous year period.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:44.480]   Growth margin decreased 20 basis points to 37.8 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2020
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.600]   from 38 percent in the prior year period.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.560]   This decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy cost as a percentage
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:04.200]   However, as Brett mentioned, we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.080]   costs as a percentage of sales.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:14.480]   Operating expenses for the quarter increased $5.5 million to $92.8 million or 28.2 percent
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:22.640]   of sales is compared with $87.3 million or 28.1 percent of sales for the prior year period.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.880]   The year over year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net new stores.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:36.240]   Our operating income for the third quarter was $31.6 million which increased by 2.8 percent
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.480]   as compared to operating income of $30.7 million for the same quarter last year and decreased
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.960]   as a percentage of sales from 9.9 percent to 9.6 percent.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:54.600]   Net interest expense for the third quarter increased $0.2 million to $7 million as compared to
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.880]   $6.8 million in the same period last year.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.140]   The weighted average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:08.240]   approximately $112 million as compared to the prior year period.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.600]   The increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease debt recorded in connection
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.200]   with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions and green field expansion as well as an increase in debt
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.480]   outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisitions.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.160]   The weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately 140
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.680]   basis points year over year due to lower LIBOR and prime interest rates as well as lower borrowing
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.960]   rates associated with new leases.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.640]   Our effective tax rate was 24.1 percent for the third quarter compared to 15.3 percent
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.660]   for the same period last year.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:51.960]   The year over year increase is primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit adjustment
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.840]   we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change which was related
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.880]   to certain deductions that the IRS accepted during examination of our fiscal 2016 and
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.320]   fiscal 2017 tax return.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:13.720]   That income for the third quarter was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the prior
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.280]   year period.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:21.360]   Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 56 cents compared to diluted
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   earnings per share of 61 cents and the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.760]   Adjusted diluted earnings per share which is a non-gap measure for the third quarter of
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:38.360]   fiscal 2020 was 60 cents which excludes from diluted earnings per share 3 cents of cost
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.480]   related to Monroe Forward Initiative and 1 cent of cost related to acquisition due diligence
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.080]   and integration.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.760]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 57 cents in the third quarter
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:56.280]   of fiscal 2019 which excluded 1 cent of cost related to Monroe Forward Initiative, 1 cent
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.680]   of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment cost and 6 cents benefit from
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.320]   the one-time income tax adjustment.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.960]   For more information on this non-gap measure, please see the reconciliation of adjusted diluted
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.480]   earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.080]   Lastly, we opened one Greenfield location during the third quarter.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.720]   As a reminder, Greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.640]   of one-to-four store operations.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.920]   Greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately $1 million each in annual
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.920]   sales.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:40.960]   As of December 28, 2019, the company had 1,289 company operated stores and 99 franchise locations
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:48.240]   as compared with 1,186 company operated stores and 99 franchise locations as of December
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.520]   29, 2018.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:57.200]   During the third quarter, we added 27 company operated stores and closed none.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.400]   Turning to Slide 9, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.960]   as we execute our growth strategy.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.200]   Our capital expenditures were $42.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, all
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.440]   of which approximately $18 million was related to investments in our Monroe Forward Initiative.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.840]   We are pleased with the progress of our Monroe Forward Strategy and we continue to expect
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.880]   an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years to
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.720]   support investments in store reimage and technology.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:38.760]   Additionally, a creative acquisition support growth strategy.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:45.320]   During the first nine months of the year, we spent approximately $104 million on acquisitions,
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.840]   including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our Greenfield expansion strategy.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:56.640]   As Brett mentioned, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.880]   an expected $120 million in annualized sales.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.660]   I'd like to provide some additional clarity here.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.920]   The $120 million in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:15.280]   fully integrated, which as we've stated in the past, is usually in year three post-acquisition.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.520]   During years one and two following the acquisition, we typically see a step down in sales given
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.280]   the process of onboarding new stores to our model.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.040]   Moving on, we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.420]   program and paid approximately $22 million in dividends in the first nine months of fiscal
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.420]   2020.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.520]   Finally, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.140]   to support our strategic growth initiatives.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.120]   We entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   covenants.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.840]   We generated approximately $125 million of cash flow from operating activities during the first
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:01.160]   nine months of fiscal 2020 and debt under our revolving credit facility increased by approximately
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.040]   $59 million.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:10.480]   Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide 10, we have updated our fiscal 2020
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.760]   comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of 1 percent to flat to reflect the
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.620]   impact of our year-to-day performance.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.640]   Based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:29.560]   closed acquisition, we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1 billion
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:38.200]   $275 million to $1 billion $290 million, an increase of 6.2 percent to 7.5 percent as compared
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.920]   to fiscal 2019 sales.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:49.480]   This compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1,295 million to $1,315 million.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.160]   Our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.680]   2020.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.520]   Given the impact of our year-to-day performance, we expect fiscal 2020 earnings for diluted
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:11.200]   share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 representing a decline of 5.1 percent to 0.8 percent year
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.080]   over year compared to $2.37 in fiscal 2019.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:23.400]   This compares to the previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.55.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.640]   On an adjusted basis, which is a non-gap measure, the company expects diluted earnings for share
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:38.480]   to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 representing a decline of 1.7 percent to growth of 2.5 percent
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.560]   which excludes from diluted earnings per share Monroe Forward Initiative costs and acquisition
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.240]   due diligence and integration costs.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.39 in fiscal 2019 which excluded
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:59.480]   Monroe Forward Initiative costs, non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs,
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.000]   acquisition due diligence and integration costs, and the benefit from the one-time income tax
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.120]   adjustment.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.280]   Acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be diluted to earnings
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.880]   per diluted share during the year.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.680]   At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect an operating margin of approximately
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:24.720]   10.2 percent interest expense to be approximately $29 million, depreciation and amortization
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:31.480]   to be approximately $65 million, and EBITDA to be approximately $196 million.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.040]   We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million this year.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.080]   This guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5 percent and is based
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.040]   on $34 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.040]   As always, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or Greenfield Store opening.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.880]   I'll now turn the call over to Brott to provide some closing remarks before we move to Q&A.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.240]   We are making solid strides in the execution of our Monroe Forward Strategy, in particular
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.400]   our store rebrand and reimage initiative.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.320]   The strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.880]   our confidence in this initiative.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.680]   The store rebrand and reimage program is further supported by our technological investments,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.960]   which we believe will help drive long-term margin expansion.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.720]   In summary, we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business,
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.800]   making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.560]   areas within our control.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.440]   We are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   ahead.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.320]   With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.320]   Thank you.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.240]   We'll be conducting a question and answer session.

[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.320]   Once again, that is star 1 to register questions at this time.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.680]   Our first question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.600]   Please go ahead.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   Good morning.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.800]   Morning, Brian.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:22.360]   So I want to focus on the weather here, but I do just want to dive deeper into sales trends
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.360]   in the quarter.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.600]   So, Brian, you mentioned, I think Brian did too, and your prepared comments.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:33.080]   You made some comment, commentary suggesting that to the degree to which weather impacted
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   the business.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.280]   So I'll go down a little further and say what that negative .9 comp would have been had the
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:45.720]   weather cooperated and some of the other metrics you're saying that really suggest the underlying
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:51.600]   business is trending better than what we saw in the weather affected fiscal queue 3.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.360]   I'll take the first part and I'll let Brian take the second part of the question, Brian.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.880]   When we look at the performance in the quarter, as we talked about, our northern markets certainly
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.260]   underperform the southern markets and give you a little more granularity on that.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:13.400]   Certainly our stores up in the Northeast and the Midwest were where you would expect to
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:20.160]   have more exposure to weather conditions like you have in the Northeast certainly underperform.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.280]   I think it's difficult to say what we would have done.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:29.000]   Certainly, I think we were expecting positive comps in the quarter.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.520]   Our internal expectations would have been closer to +1 to +1.5 assuming normalized weather conditions
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.160]   that we have seen in the past.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.960]   We felt really good coming out of October/November given the strength of last year's performance
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:53.240]   we were hoping against and didn't get the cooperation from the weather in December that we were certainly
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.240]   expecting.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:00.240]   As I made the comments in my prepared remarks, we certainly don't like talking about the weather,
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:06.080]   Brian, but we can't ignore the fact that when 50% of our business is tires and we have a
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.720]   high concentration of stores in the Northeast and Midwest, we are going to have outsized
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.520]   exposure to our comp performance.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:21.540]   Brian, would you mind restating the second part of your question?
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.680]   I think you covered … Maybe I'll just follow the question if I could.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.240]   The adjusted guidance … You mentioned so in January, you did a negative 4.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.320]   If I'm doing the math, it looks as though the adjusted guidance would suggest some type
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   of pickup in business in February/March.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.160]   I guess the first question is that assumption correct?
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.780]   The following question is … I know we've seen this before with your business, but at
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:56.180]   what point does … We have potentially a long time in the winter, the weather could still
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:02.000]   come, but is there a point at which in the quarter where the weather just comes too late?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:10.280]   Yeah, so Brian, your assumption is correct regarding the implied comps.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:18.480]   If you think about Q4 at the midpoint of, let's say, down 0.5 … For the full year, down 0.5,
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:25.000]   that implies Q4 of down 2, which would be about February and March being down 1 in order to
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   get to that down 2.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.320]   That's the dynamic at the midpoint, so there is an expectation of a pickup in February
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   and March.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:39.800]   Brian, maybe just to comment on the second part, as we get deeper into the fourth quarter
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.700]   or fourth quarter, the second half of the quarter in particular, I think we become less sensitive
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:53.760]   to the weather as you transition out of, say, pure winter conditions into spring.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.640]   Certainly I think the later in the quarter you get snowfall certainly doesn't have the
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:04.080]   same impact on tire demand like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.440]   October or November.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:12.360]   Consumers are pretty frifty with their money and I believe you get snowfall late in the season.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.640]   We have a tendency to forego that purchase and push it out until next season, in particular.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:23.580]   The other thing to call out as well is, if you look at our historic performance at the
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:30.440]   company, December and January have always been the most volatile month that we had to continue
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   with.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:37.040]   I think what we've seen in past performance here, trends coming out of December, January
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:42.960]   don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring month.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   Given the mild December/January heading into the balance of the quarter, we feel pretty
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.160]   good about the guidance range we provided.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:56.760]   As Brian said, our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our CompSales guidance, it assumes
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.060]   run rate coming out of January, which we certainly believe we're going to be better than that
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.400]   as we roll into FY21.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   I appreciate all the color.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   Thank you.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.400]   Thank you.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   Our next question is coming from Jonathan Lamers of BMO Capital Markets, please go ahead.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.400]   Thanks.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:26.040]   Brett, looking at your slide on the store rebranding, you know, the 18% performance of the rebranded
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.760]   stores, I think it's good.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   I'm curious, from your analytic model, how many years should it take a rebranded store
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.400]   to reach projected run rate sales?
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:48.200]   If you look at the top quadrant of that slide, Jonathan, we've shared, you know, with investors
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.800]   the fact that our service stores do roughly $600,000 in revenue and our tire stores do $1
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   million too.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.240]   In the case where we're rebranding a service store, you're working off the base on average
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:06.720]   of $600,000 and if we've seen a double digit comp improvement off of that base, you can
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:13.520]   get to implied numbers certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp to the full
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.000]   maturity equally in the average sales performance of our tire branded stores.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.560]   That's one of the things that's encouraging about the strategy for us is not that it's
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:30.840]   just a one-time step up in sales, this creates the opportunity to create multiple years of
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:39.100]   sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning, our brand related tires starts to mature.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:44.120]   Keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.280]   So if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires, we won't be relevant
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.880]   To put that on a timeline, if you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.440]   out to average sales performance of a tire branded store.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:09.560]   Okay, so just to circle up on that for the stores where you're rebranding, there's nothing
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.240]   about their market.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:19.000]   You would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.240]   stores at the $1.2 million, is that correct?
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.520]   Yeah, as a general statement, that's correct.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.900]   I think certainly you're going to have markets that will exceed the average and you'll have
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:35.560]   some markets that will be lower than that and that's part of the choices that we may be using
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.560]   the analytic model.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:44.160]   But on average, as we look across our, I'll say the opportunity stores that be in the $555,
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.400]   I think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential of the
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.540]   $1.2 over time as they mature.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.540]   Thanks.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:35:03.360]   Switching gears, Brian, how much of a headwind to that revenue from acquisition were the conversions
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.800]   of the 42 California stores this quarter?
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:13.040]   Yeah, I mean, we had some disruption there.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:19.960]   I would say we haven't really quantified that from a sales standpoint, but that's a great
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:25.400]   point, Jonathan, in that we have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the Monroe
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:33.720]   Playbook and then shortly thereafter, in this case about six months, get the reimage in-store
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.320]   brand standards in place.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:44.440]   In Q3, the 42 California stores went through that and are substantially through that as
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:50.000]   of the end of Q3, but we haven't quantified it, but it certainly had some impact on their
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.400]   sales performance in the quarter.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:36:00.160]   Okay, and that $1.8 million charge for Monroe Forward Initiative this quarter, what was that
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   for?
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:09.560]   Yeah, it was all related to the store rebrand and reimage, and it falls into three primary
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.840]   buckets related to that.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:20.720]   The first is noncapital items that we send to the stores, so as we think about updated safety
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:26.640]   chains, updated bay banners, updated point of sale marketing materials, all of these things
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:34.480]   to get the store initially to the standard that are not capital in terms of the actual
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:38.800]   work and construction done on the store, that's the first bucket.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   The second bucket is noncapital work that's actually done.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:51.960]   We get into these stores and we identify noncapital repairs, demolition, as well as some of the
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:58.580]   fixed versus replace items, for example stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.580]   a new floor.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:04.440]   Those are things that make sense economically, but you get different treatment from expense
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.760]   versus capital for, so that's the second bucket.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.360]   And the third is just right off of existing leaseholds in the stores, anything from counters
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:19.000]   to maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition when we initially
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.920]   branded the stores over to Monroe Brand.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:28.360]   Those are the three primary buckets that the Monroe Forward Initiative costs consist of.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.360]   Okay.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   Thanks for your comments.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.360]   Thank you.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.000]   Excuse me, our next question is coming from Brett Jordan of Jeffries.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Please go ahead.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Hey.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Good morning guys.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Good morning.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   We're back.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Hey.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Back to slide five.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.420]   I guess if we look at the 18% growth in rebranded stores, if we really sort of look at the comparable
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.420]   growth there.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:55.320]   What's the new product lines you're adding, how's the service comp against the service
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.320]   comp in those stores?
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.680]   Are you seeing, you know, a pickup as you change the brand?
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:05.620]   Yeah, maybe just to clarify though, Brett, I think we're actually not adding any new products
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.920]   to the service menu.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.920]   Right.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.040]   But you're adding tires to the store, right?
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.200]   Yeah, it's just mixed, right?
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:18.040]   So even our service stores today sell tires, it's only 15% they're mixed, so we're certainly
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:26.600]   seeing more outsize growth in their tire sales and we've had success in maintaining the rate
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:33.360]   of growth that we've seen on the service side, which has been part of our thesis is hold on
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:39.320]   to the service business that we've enjoyed that's high margin and then add to that more relevancy
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:44.520]   to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the tire category.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.040]   We're seeing growth on both sides.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:53.080]   Okay, and I guess we look at the reimage, how does that compare to comparable service stores
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.480]   in the network that hadn't been re-imaged, I guess sort of looking at it again, sort of
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.120]   apples to apples against the old stores?
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.280]   I think if you can figure out which stores we're talking about there, the 30 stores are
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:12.460]   Rochester and I think the Rochester stores certainly have been performing quite well relative
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.920]   to what our expectations were on reimage.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.560]   We certainly didn't expect to see double-digit growth rates out of our reimage store when we
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:25.280]   set out to do this initiative, but we were seeing more positive growth out of the stores
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:30.800]   up until the last quarter given the exposure that we've had to the weather in the north.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.760]   Compared to other stores, we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a customer service
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:41.840]   point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers facing similar
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.360]   I would say market backdrop from a weather point of view.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   Okay.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.840]   Could you give us I guess sort of the spread between the southern store cop and the northern
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:55.160]   store cop, how big of a delta was it?
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:00.240]   I mean, it was a couple hundred basis points of performance.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   Okay.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.640]   And I guess for housekeeping, could you give us the monthly?
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   Yeah, so we were, one second here, Brett.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:18.640]   We were down 1.2 in October, down 1.7 in November and up 0.4 in December.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.640]   Okay.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.960]   And then one, this is, sorry, I had the question, on the supply chain side, I mean just to throw
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.800]   the virus into it since that's popular these days, you guys do a lot of direct sourcing
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.400]   the white box product out of China.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.960]   Do you see any impact on supply chain from what's going on?
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.680]   We haven't seen any to this point, Brett.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:46.320]   We're obviously working through contingency plans, which we have had to develop actually
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:53.040]   related to the tariff issues, so we feel pretty confident that through the network of your
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.720]   multiple supply points that we'll be able to overcome any particular issues coming from
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.720]   the virus.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.720]   I'm sorry, Brett.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.720]   Go ahead.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:09.000]   I said no, I was joking, I had to get my first virus question in there.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.520]   All right, thanks a lot guys.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.760]   Okay, thanks, Brett.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   Thank you.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.720]   Our next question is coming from Rick Nelson of Stevens.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.720]   Please go ahead.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   Thanks.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   Good morning.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.720]   Like too.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.720]   Good morning.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:31.680]   Follow up on the weather last year, I think December, January, are you also pointing
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   to mild winter weather?
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:41.740]   Do you think this year was incrementally worse than the prior year?
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:48.080]   I think if you look at, you know, analyst reports that we've seen talking about, I guess
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:54.640]   the impact that the mild winter has had on not only our category, but other retail, like
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:42:00.680]   the data would indicate that this has been more mild, certainly versus last year.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:06.040]   I think we look at precipitation, which is very important for us as a form of snow with
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:12.600]   our tire business, certainly it's been a much more mild winter this year relative to last
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   year.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:23.480]   Thanks and Brett, any updates on your partnership with Amazon, what you're seeing there on the
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:35.800]   install side and how you think your tire prices compared to theirs and the tire category overall
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:43.040]   I'm curious about what happened with units in the period and market share?
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   Yep.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.960]   So let's start with units.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:56.400]   Our units were down two, average selling price was up one for the quarter.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.760]   How that compares, we don't have a lot of syndicated data, of course, we can look to and be definitive
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.760]   on that.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:09.400]   We lean on, I guess our channel checks and information from our tire manufacturers that have good visibility
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   across multiple brands and it feels like similar to other companies that have exposure to the
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:22.080]   north, particularly northeast, which is a degree that we do feel like we are probably in line
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.000]   with what we picked up through suppliers and others.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.640]   As relates to Amazon, I think we're still pleased with our relationship with them as well as
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.960]   other online tire retailers.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:43.400]   We will eventually expand the relationship in FY 21 to include all stores.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:50.240]   We talked about last quarter, our priority has been what I mentioned on today's call, completing
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.840]   the tire category management pricing tool as well as the labor scheduling tool just for
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:01.200]   our organization on a higher priority at this stage than expanding, but we are committed
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.160]   to expanding that relationship going forward.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.120]   Related to tire pricing, as you know Rick, the tire category is very complicated, you
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:15.460]   know, over 30,000 SKUs that you need to manage effectively across multiple markets and one
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.280]   of the reasons why we've invested in the tire category management tool is to do a couple
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.280]   of things.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:28.320]   One is give us much better visibility into demand dynamics defined by elasticity down to
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:34.440]   a SKU level and by having that visibility, it's going to create a much more granular approach
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:39.640]   that we're going to use for pricing.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.660]   It allows us to price at the SKU level in our industry with the intent being strike that
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:50.280]   right balance between driving the right price to drive unit volume while preserving and expanding
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.440]   our entire margins through right mix at right price.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:59.200]   I'm encouraged we're in pilot form of that now.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.640]   We will be operational by Q1 of next year, fully operational.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.800]   The rollout of that's pretty small in scale because we control our pricing centrally, so
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.200]   a small team of people will be trained up on using that system.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:17.600]   But between now and Q1 we'll be testing in parallel and make sure we're confident with
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.000]   the results that we're seeing from the system.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.560]   That makes sense, thanks for the color and good luck.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.280]   Thanks Rick.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   Thank you.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.240]   Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.040]   on your telephone keypad.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.800]   Our next question is coming from Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   Please go ahead.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   Hi.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   Good morning.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.880]   Thank you for the question.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.880]   Morning.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.840]   I wanted to go back.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.640]   I know in the prior quarters when you started rolling out some of these store refreshes, you
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.960]   called out a hit or head one to comp during that quarter, really just from distraction.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.640]   You know, it makes sense as you're in there kind of reworking and revamping the stores.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.800]   I believe you said it was about a 70 basis to find hit last quarter.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.840]   Did you quantify that this quarter or is there a way for you to kind of break that out or
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.200]   just whether overshadow that?
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:18.040]   Yeah, I think we said last quarter, Stephanie, that we, we walked everyone kind of through
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:25.320]   the seven step process and talked about how we were retooling it to take a lot of that
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.120]   work or almost all that work off of the store team.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.840]   So we were able to effectively do that in Q3.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.040]   We didn't expect that we were going to have to talk about a head wind and we really don't
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.680]   have to in terms of, from disruption related to the store reimage.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:46.760]   I think the California stores on the West Coast maybe saw a little bit more in disruption
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:53.600]   just because we did put a little bit more on them based on their lack of proximity to our
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.480]   core resources that are doing the reimage, but for the 74 comp stores, those were largely,
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.600]   I would say, undisrupted.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   Great.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.880]   And then just as a follow up, when we look at the Tire category in general, what are you
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.640]   saying from this over in an inflationary environment?
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:15.400]   I know it was inflationary earlier this year, kind of reviewing how you saw during the quarter
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.260]   and your expectations going forward as well.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:25.200]   Yes Stephanie, when you look at, go back to Q2, one of the things we commented on was just
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:32.400]   we saw some inflationary pricing on, I would say the top end of the product category with
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:39.160]   more premium brands and the first part of the second quarter we didn't see a lot of movement
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.360]   on the low end brands, if you will, opening price point brands.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.800]   We saw that change exiting Q2 and into Q3 and I think as you saw and we made the comments
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:56.560]   in our prepared remarks, we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across all
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.560]   price points.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:06.080]   Relative to that point in Q3, I think our expectation for Q4 is pretty stable environment around pricing.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.720]   We don't expect meaningful material changes in the next quarter.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:19.680]   I think we're very focused now on now optimizing our internal pricing relative to the market,
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.400]   leveraging the category management pricing until we talk about it.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:31.460]   Great and then just lastly for me, a more high level as we think through the strategy to expand
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:37.960]   just your tire services at some of those mixed changes at your service stores, does that
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:43.280]   just by nature puts you a little bit more susceptible to changes in weather on an annual
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   basis?
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:49.680]   To your point, you said on the call that it is the tire category that if it's a more mild
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.480]   weather where you don't really see the volume during that period.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.000]   Does this mean that in these conversations going forward, weather could have a larger impact
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   or similar to what we saw this year than maybe in prior years?
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.340]   Maybe your thoughts on that at this high level would be great.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.120]   Thanks so much.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.120]   Thanks Stephanie.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:14.560]   I think strategically, I would start with this, they are strategy in rows.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:20.440]   We like the business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that's focused on tires
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.440]   and full service.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:27.400]   I think you're not going to see us migrate to a tire only category as a broad sweeping strategy
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.560]   for all the reasons you just mentioned.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.200]   We like diversification in the services.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:38.800]   We like being very relevant on frequently purchased items like schedule maintenance for cars and
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.040]   certainly brakes and other undercar services.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:48.480]   I think as we increase our total business, certainly we're going to pick up a little more exposure
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:53.960]   to tires as we convert more stores in the north, I think to that.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:59.320]   However, I think our broader company strategy is diversify our store footprint more into
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:05.040]   the south and out west and certainly in those regions of the country, you don't see I think
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:10.440]   a level of volatility that comes with the tire business like you would find in the northeast
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   and midwestern markets.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:22.000]   Great, that's everything for me.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.640]   I appreciate it.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.640]   Thanks Stephanie.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.640]   Thank you.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.260]   This is coming from Scott Stember of CL King.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.260]   Please go ahead.
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.800]   Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.300]   Where's Scott?
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:42.200]   Following up on that last question about high level, about weather and I know the goal here
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.200]   was with all this heavy lifting that you're doing right now and all these processes get
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:52.840]   to the point where I guess we're now talking about weather having worked, weather does not
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.720]   really deliver all the quarter from a common perspective.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.960]   Can you talk about, I mean just broadly speaking about how long do you think that will take
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:06.080]   for us to get to that point where weather could be a headwind but it's not going to be a determinant
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.840]   whether you're positive or negative from a common standpoint?
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:17.600]   I think given our exposure to the northeast and as long as our store concentration is heavy
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:23.460]   in the Midwest and northeast inherent in that as we pick up exposure I think to weather,
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:28.600]   obviously we don't like to talk about it Scott as you said, our strategy is to diversify the
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:33.920]   footprint, keep continuing to grow down south and that's reflected by our acquisitions, we
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:40.560]   continue to build out Florida and have expanded now into Louisiana and Tennessee and certainly
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:46.600]   out west is reflected of that desire to create more or less volatility in our business due
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.680]   to the store footprint.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:57.720]   Now in our core store markets we don't accept internally the volatility in our business and
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:04.360]   we're invested in technology as we talked about to help us better execute in stores through
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:10.640]   better trained people, executing better on the phones with our phone upgrade that we're currently
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   doing.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:16.080]   All the initiatives under Monroe Forward are designed to drive performance in our stores
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:21.600]   regardless of weather so I think we'll help neutralize some of the impact that we see from
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.640]   the volatility that comes with snow and colder temperatures.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:33.600]   Got it and just a last question, you know I know that there are certain things like tires
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:40.960]   that we'll see an immediate impact from weather but more on the side of mechanical parts typically
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:48.640]   you could see an impact from, you know, warmer weather or colder weather, you know, a few quarters
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   down the road.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.200]   Is there a chance that we could see an extended negative impact on the mechanical part side
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.120]   in the next couple of quarters and that's all I have.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   Thanks.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.120]   Thanks Scott.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:05.360]   I think as we commented in the quarter our breaks were down 3% in the quarter certainly
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.840]   we're up against strong comp from last year but also I would say we do sell a fair share
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:15.400]   of brake services through tires because if you take the consumers' tires off their vehicle
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:21.840]   it gives you the chance to inspect their wheels, their brakes and we do see some nice demand
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.960]   for conversion from tires into brakes as a result of that.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:32.880]   As it relates to the downstream effect I think certainly more harsh winters have a tendency
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:39.440]   to tear up things on the vehicles however I will say one benefit of having a more mild
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:45.720]   winter is usually that it leads to spring coming sooner, it opens up a window I think for an
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:53.200]   extended spring selling season so we felt, feel like we're well positioned I think coming
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.080]   out of the winter given our strengths and how we perform historically in the service categories
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:03.980]   and given the emphasis that we placed on good better best packages in store I think we feel
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:08.960]   confident that we'll be well positioned going into the spring selling season.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.960]   Got it.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.960]   That's all I have.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.960]   Thanks.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:13.960]   Thanks God.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:14.960]   Thank you.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:21.320]   At this time I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:25.120]   Thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest and support in Monroe.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.960]   We believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy and drive long term value for
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.960]   our shareholders.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:32.560]   We look forward updating you on our progress next quarter.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.720]   Have a great day.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:40.240]   Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation, this concludes today's event.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.360]   You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620]   Good morning and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 General Electric Company Earnings Conference
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.620]   Call.
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.220]   My name's Brandon and I'll be your operator for today.
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.360]   At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.120]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session during which you can dial star one
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.780]   if you have a question.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.320]   Please note this conference is being recorded and I will now turn it over to Steve Winiker,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.780]   Vice President of Investor Communications, you may begin sir.
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.780]   Thanks Brandon.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.680]   Good morning and welcome to GE's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.520]   I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO Larry Kulp and CFO, Carolina Dadekapa.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.860]   Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.360]   on our website.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.060]   Note that some of the statements we're making are forward looking and are based on our best
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.440]   view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.220]   As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change if the world changes.
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.140]   With that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.180]   Steve, thanks.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.220]   Good morning everyone.
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.100]   We hope you and your families are healthy and safe.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.660]   Our thoughts are with all of those affected by this global pandemic.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.540]   We recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone.
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.340]   On behalf of GE, I want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical community,
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.380]   many of whom were privileged to call our customers, working tirelessly to protect all of us.
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.380]   Thank you.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.980]   When we last spoke during our Outlook call in March, we were encouraged by the continued
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.700]   strength and aviation and health care and the progress made in power and renewables.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.540]   In the eight-week sense, the world has fundamentally changed.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.740]   As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly, hitting hard and hitting fast.
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.620]   While this is an earnings call, our goal today is to provide you with the most current and
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.260]   relevant information we have and as always, to be as open and transparent as we possibly
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.260]   can.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.820]   So forgive us if we run a little long today.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.820]   The COVID-19 dynamics at GE, like the economy at large, are fluid and still evolving, but
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.780]   clearly challenging in the near term.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.940]   With that, I'll start with our response to COVID-19, Carolina, who is joining our earnings
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.020]   call for the first time will cover the financials, then I'll wrap with a more in-depth view of
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.460]   our current operations.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.820]   Moving to slide two, during this unprecedented time, we're focused on three areas.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.380]   First, the health and safety of our employees and our communities.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.780]   We established a COVID-19 Task Force that is working to ensure we're doing everything
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.100]   in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with various government directives
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.380]   and medical advisories in real time.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.660]   To that end, we've encouraged those employees who are not directly performing customer-facing
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.780]   essential jobs to work from home wherever possible.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.060]   But given the mission critical work we do at GE, not everyone can stay home.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.700]   I'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.300]   unwavering dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers, supporting essential services
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.860]   like hospitals, power generation, airlines and national defense.
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.620]   We're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.300]   This includes temperature screenings, face coverings and gloves as necessary and physical distancing,
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.940]   all keeping with national, state and local guidelines.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.740]   I'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.740]   We recently established an Employee Relief Fund and more than 75 senior leaders across
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.940]   GE have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.300]   Our second priority is continuing to serve our customers.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.060]   In healthcare, we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.700]   and treat COVID-19 patients including respiratory CT monitoring solutions, X-ray anesthesia and
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.120]   point of care ultrasound product lines.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.980]   Already our team has doubled production of ventilators and plans to double again by the
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.340]   end of June.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.180]   Healthcare digital and AI solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.980]   at once and automate wrote tasks so clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.860]   on lifesaving work.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.940]   Across all of our businesses, we're in constant communication with employees, customers, suppliers
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.580]   and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.860]   Our third priority is preserving our strength.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.540]   First and foremost, sound liquidity is crucial and solidifying our balance sheet remains
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.500]   a key focus.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.060]   With the recent closing of the biopharma transaction, we received $20 billion of net
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.220]   proceeds.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.020]   This provides GE with optionality to protect our company and remain flexible and importantly
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.940]   we retain the $17 billion leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem striving
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.180]   for precision health.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.460]   Preserving our strength at a time like this also requires a different operating model.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.140]   Here I draw on my experience as a CEO managing through 9/11 and the global financial crisis.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.900]   There are three steps in this model.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.980]   Embrace reality, redefine winning and execute the plan.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.260]   Easy to say, hard to do.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.140]   Starting with embrace reality, this is necessary in a time like this when so much has changed
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.780]   and remains uncertain.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.540]   For us, it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.620]   be for a while.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.100]   We wish it were otherwise, but that's not our reality.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.060]   Next, redefine winning.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.700]   We came into 2020 with a plan that defined winning as profitable growth, margin expansion
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.700]   and cash generation.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.300]   Now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.260]   Let me share some ways we're doing this.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:21.340]   While safety has always been a top priority for GE, COVID-19 has reshaped our safety agenda.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.780]   In terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and decriminal margins
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.780]   within the second half, our key focus areas and in health care, we clearly didn't come
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.060]   into the year expecting to increase our ventilator production in fourfold, but we will.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.100]   And finally, execute the plan.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.880]   We're moving with speed, discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure targeting more
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.380]   than $2 billion of cost actions and more than $3 billion of cash actions.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.460]   And this is where lean is particularly relevant from daily management through traditional
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.060]   Kanban systems which helped reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools we're rolling
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.420]   out across GE.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.620]   Let me share a recent example from gas power.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.020]   In our Greenville facility, the team used lean to cut the distance that a single part travels
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:16.260]   during production from three miles, yes, three miles, to a mere 165 feet, flashing the time
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.820]   it took to make that part by 42%.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.540]   These are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this environment.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.100]   So that's our approach here.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:34.420]   We're facing the pandemic head on while continuing to execute our long-term strategy for GE.
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.740]   Moving to slide three, you'll find a snapshot of our first quarter results and Carolina
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.620]   will take you through this in detail, but first a few top line thoughts.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:49.540]   As I noted, we entered the year with momentum, however, as COVID-19 continued to spread globally
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.940]   and I'm not going to sugarcoat this, we got hit hard in some of our highest margin parts
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.420]   of our best performing businesses.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.160]   This is especially true at aviation services where COVID-19 caused a rapid decline in
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.260]   commercial aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the second half
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.580]   of March.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.220]   A similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions caused by
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.100]   COVID-19 impacted our field personnel.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.420]   Then across all of our businesses, we started to see some project fulfillment and execution
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.420]   issues.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.460]   At the same time, healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.540]   in the fight against COVID-19.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:38.420]   Taking a step back, about 80% of our roughly $400 billion backlog is in services which
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.980]   have a long time horizon and while services have been hurt in the near term, those capabilities
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.100]   remain one of our greatest strengths.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.220]   They keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships, especially through
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.220]   periods of volatility.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.120]   So in the spirit of embracing reality, let me frame for you what we're seeing right now
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.940]   at a high level and then I'll do a deeper dive after Carolina reviews the first quarter.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.520]   In aviation and at GCast, airlines are conserving cash, not flying the planes they have, limiting
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.500]   maintenance fare, spend where they can and all the while deferring orders in many places.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.820]   No one can predict when and how leisure and business travel will resume, but the reality
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.560]   is likely it's not soon.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.380]   So we're redefining winning from margin expansion in 2020 to improving our decriminal margins
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.600]   this year, which requires we aggressively adjust our cost structure.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.980]   That's what winning looks like for aviation and they're moving forward with a comprehensive
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.980]   plan.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:44.220]   To be clear, we'll get back to targeting those 20% operating margins post pandemic.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.020]   For healthcare, we've been on the front lines combating COVID-19 since the early days in
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.840]   Wuhan.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.700]   This is fundamental to our mission.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.780]   While we've seen demand surge for certain products, other products including those in
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:03.660]   our high margin pharmaceutical diagnostics business have been negatively impacted as
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.020]   multiple procedures are deferred.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.300]   Healthcare is likely to rebound faster than aviation, but we're still fast tracking additional
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:18.820]   cost out actions targeting an incremental $700 million since Karen and the team spoke with
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.520]   you in December.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.020]   Empower and renewable energy, the impact of COVID-19 has been more limited to date.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.820]   Specifically at power, we're experiencing outage delays and restrictions in field service
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.500]   travel and we're monitoring new unit orders and services.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.220]   To offset this, we're further right sizing the cost structure and empower we already
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:45.500]   reduced head count by 700 in the first quarter.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.660]   Now clearly across GE there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:57.260]   including the full duration magnitude and pace of recovery across our end markets operations
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.500]   and supply chains.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.820]   We're also monitoring how the resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.700]   and our runoff insurance business.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.700]   So let me tell you what we do know.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.700]   The second quarter will be the first full quarter with pressure from COVID-19 and we expect that
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.780]   our financial results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:26.060]   The bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead, but this too shall pass.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:32.340]   I'm confident the underlying reset we took over the last 18 months to focus GE's portfolio
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.420]   and instill a greater focus on customers and lead give us a running start for what we face
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.020]   today.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:46.380]   Moreover, I've seen our response to COVID-19 signs of how we're moving faster to change GE
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.660]   for the good, more to rework to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:57.180]   in aviation, travel restrictions spurring on the use of remote digital technology to complete
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.900]   field work and renewables and more capital discipline across the board with new leaders
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:08.580]   assimilating faster and with real impact healthcare comes to mind.
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.960]   So all of this in combination with the planned actions we'll discuss later are accelerating
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.700]   our transformation of GE.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.980]   With that, I'll turn it over to Carolina, but before I do, let me say how pleased I am
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.540]   to have her on board.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:26.140]   In two short months, it's clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:33.420]   operational bias reaction and executing with speed.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.420]   Thank you Larry.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:41.340]   I'm proud to join my first earnings call at CFO of GE and help lead this company forward.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.300]   As you noted, we're operating in unprecedented times.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:50.980]   I'll be focused on first keeping our financial position strong and safe with the keen eye on
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.860]   leverage on liquidity as well as cash flow and capital discipline.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.860]   While GE's actions over the last couple of years have put us on stronger footing ahead
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.140]   of this situation, we will do more.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:07.740]   Second, working with our businesses to take the right action, not only to help mitigate
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:14.180]   the impact of COVID-19, but to serve customers better, operate smarter and more efficiently
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.580]   and integrate lean more holistically.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.860]   While Larry and I are focused on the near term, we're also managing for the long term.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.540]   We're working together to reduce complexity at GE and build a lean culture that delivers
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.340]   sustainable earnings and cash flow generation.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:35.500]   Today, my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.820]   help you see what I see across the businesses.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.380]   With that, let's turn to slide four.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.500]   This was a challenging quarter for us as the macro environment rapidly deteriorated.
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.300]   Taking it from the top.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.620]   Quarter orders were down 3% organically or down 4x biopharma.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:00.200]   Growth in power and health care was offset by double-digit declines in aviation and renewables.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.380]   Both equipment and service orders were down low single digits.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.740]   I'll cover this by business shortly.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.460]   Industrial revenue was down 5% organically or down 6x biopharma.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.060]   With equipment revenue flat and services down 9%.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:22.340]   Both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID-19.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.280]   Adjusted industrial profit margins were down 450 basis points organically.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.420]   Most of the dilution came from aviation and renewables, with the aviation impact mostly
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.420]   driven by COVID-19.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:40.820]   Now let's discuss the EPS walk, starting at continuing EPS of 72 cents.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:46.620]   It was a 75 cents gain primarily related to the 11.5 billion off-the-tax gain from the
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:52.740]   biopharma sale, which also included one cent of tax benefit in geocapital.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:58.980]   This was partially offset by a 4.6 billion off-the-tax loss on our remaining Baker huge stake, which
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.300]   we measure at fair value edge quarter.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.700]   On restructuring and other items, we incurred two cents of charges.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:11.220]   This is principally related to the reduction of aviation's U.S. workforce.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:17.300]   Lastly, non-operating pension and other benefit plans were 6 cents head within the quarter.
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.700]   Excluding these items, adjusted EPS was 5 cents.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.060]   As described earlier, our earnings performance was materially impacted by COVID-19 and other
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.060]   market dynamics.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:32.580]   This was primarily in aviation and geocapital, with negative marks and impairments in both
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.100]   precars and insurance, as well as higher credit costs.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:44.020]   We estimate the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from COVID-19 roughly 700 million.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:49.220]   Privates included lower aftermarket sales, project delays and supply chain constraints.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:55.180]   This impact is higher than anticipated at the March outlook call, reflecting the rapid
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:00.420]   global progression of the pandemic, while our prior forecast largely reflected the slowdown
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.420]   in China.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:07.220]   Our focus on addressing this pandemic is global, we're targeting more than $2 billion of cost
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.220]   out this year.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:14.260]   While this may not affect the full impact, we're rapidly addressing both cost and cash and making
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.980]   our businesses more agile and customer focused over time.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:22.820]   I can tell you from my experience that as these programs build momentum and the company leaders
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:28.140]   begin to see how powerful results can be, they tend to extend beyond their stated goals.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.260]   With just what I have seen so far, I'm encouraged that we can have some of that sales experience
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.260]   achieve.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:40.940]   Moving to cash, as many of you know, the first quarter is typically low for our free cash
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.940]   flow.
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:48.460]   This year we're impacted by our usual seasonality, but also COVID-19, especially in aviation.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.300]   Industrial free cash flow was the use of $2.2 billion, $1 billion worse than prior year.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:59.100]   But notably excluding aviation, each industrial business improved free cash flow versus last
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.780]   year, turning to the key drivers in the quarter.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.940]   Starting with net earnings, if you exclude the biopharm again and the market-to-market
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:15.380]   on our baking cubes investment, income depreciation and amortization total $700 million, that's
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.940]   down $900 million versus prior year.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:24.940]   Working capital, negative $2.6 billion, the significant use of cash, down $1.1 billion.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.480]   Let me take it through the main factors.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:33.620]   First, we had the net inflow in accounts receivable, driven by seasonally lower volume in gas power
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.620]   and renewables.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:40.500]   Second, we had an outflow in accounts cable, driven by lower volume in aviation and higher
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.780]   disbursements related to prior year material buys in renewables.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:50.780]   Third, we increased inventory to support an expected second and third quarter volume ramp
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.780]   in onshore wind and shop output declined in aviation.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:18:00.320]   Fourth, progress collections, they were a use of cash as new orders and milestone payments
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.420]   were more than effected by burn down of prior progress payments in power and renewables.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.960]   Lastly, we also spent about $600 million in gross capital.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:15.700]   We don't track now to reduce 25% of our cap expense this year.
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:21.580]   For cash flow in total, we estimate the first quarter impact from COVID-19 of around $1 billion,
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.060]   the majority of which was felt in aviation.
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.180]   As we look forward, we expect continued free cash flow pressure.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.620]   We're targeting more than $3 billion in cash action.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.220]   However, over time, we know that each business can be a better cash generator as we improve
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.420]   execution.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.500]   Moving to slide six, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.460]   Largest milestone in the quarter was closing by a pharma, with $20 billion of profit.
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:57.220]   We ended the quarter with $33.8 billion of industry cash up approximately $16 billion sequentially.
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:04.620]   TA capital ended with $13.5 billion of cash down approximately $5.3 billion sequentially,
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.300]   driven by contractual majorities.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.660]   We continue to hold a liquidity balance covering 12 months of G debt majorities.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:18.780]   We've recently taken actions to enhance and extend our liquidity and pay-down debt.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:24.780]   On April 17th, GE entered into a three-year $15 billion syndicated revolving credit facility.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:32.060]   This was a planned refinancing of GE's prior $20 billion syndicated revolver credit facility,
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.440]   providing bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of $20 billion in total credit
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.460]   lines action going forward.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.100]   Following the sale of biopharma, we also improved our liquidity profile in April.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:50.420]   We reduced our near-term debt maturity by issuing $6 billion in GE debt in April and subsequently
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.460]   tendering for $4.2 billion of debt.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:57.820]   We plan to use the remaining $1.8 billion of proceeds to further debt reduction and the
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.420]   combination of transactions will therefore be leveraged neutral.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:10.640]   GE Industrial has noted majorities in 2021, $1.9 billion of majorities in 2022 and $900
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.140]   billion in 2023.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:17.300]   At GE Industrial, we reduced debts by approximately $7 billion.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.140]   We reduced commercial paper used by $1.1 billion in the quarter and we paid $6 billion of the
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.340]   intercompany loan from GE to GE capital in April, using proceeds from biopharma.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:35.020]   At GE Capital, we reduced debts by $4 billion, so we reduced external debt by $10 billion
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:41.580]   yesterday including $4.7 billion of majorities in the quarter and an additional $5.4 billion
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:48.420]   of 2020 majorities tended in April, offset by GE's $6 billion repayment from the intercompany
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.420]   loan.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:56.700]   Our financial policy goals remain, maintaining a high cash balance, achieving less than
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:03.220]   $2.5 times net debt to EBDA at GE Industrial and less than four times debt to equity at
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:10.620]   GE Capital, accrediting in the single A range and reinstating a dividend in line with peers
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.620]   over time.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:16.660]   We remain committed to achieving our leverage targets, but we now expect to achieve those
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:23.340]   targets over a longer period than previously and not due to the impact of COVID-19.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:28.460]   On slide seven, we'll discuss industrial segments results.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:34.160]   Starting with aviation, as we've noted, our first quarter results were materially impacted.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.780]   Orders were down 13 percent organically with both equipment and service orders bound.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.740]   Equipment orders were down 27 percent, primarily driven by commercial engines business due
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.260]   to the max grounding and the COVID impact.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:54.060]   Services orders were down 4 percent, primarily driven by commercial services, partially offset
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:59.900]   by military, which one new fighter and helicopter service orders from the U.S. DOD.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.620]   Service orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders, which were up 60
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.380]   percent year over year.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:13.580]   Backlog of $273 billion was flat sequentially and up 22 percent versus prior year, primarily
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.740]   driven by long-term service agreements.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:22.300]   This included roughly $200 billion unit order cancellations in the quarter.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.540]   Revenue was down 11 percent organically.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.960]   Equipment revenue was down 17 percent.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:36.020]   We shipped 472 commercial install and spare engine units this quarter, down 37 versus prior year.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:46.120]   272 deep 1A and 1B units were down 152 and CFM 56 units were down 98 units.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.820]   Service revenue was down 8 percent due to commercial services down 11 percent.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:58.500]   This was driven by lower spare parts shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of COVID-19.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:04.900]   Total military revenue was down 7 percent, with 146 engine units shipments down 9 percent.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.940]   And this was driven by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound material rates partly
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.460]   assessed by the advanced programs growth.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.620]   Operating profit was down 39 percent organically, primarily on lower volume and negative mixed
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:26.280]   pressures in commercial services from the impact of COVID-19 and lower spare engine units.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.840]   Segment margin contracted 650 basis points organically, and this was primarily due to COVID-19 impacting
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.740]   our commercial businesses in both engines and services.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:44.340]   They continued 737 max grounding, the non-repeat of prior year favorable contract adjustments
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:49.220]   and the first full quarter of revenue from our arid rivetive business now that we have deconsolidated
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.220]   Baker Fuels.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:56.180]   To add a bit more color, COVID-19 represents just over half of the year-over-year margin
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.180]   difference.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:02.820]   737 max timing considering install and spare engine volume and supply chain excess costs
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.100]   represent additional 20 percent on the rise.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:13.640]   Moving to healthcare, which performed well, orders were up 9 percent organically, equipment
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.020]   orders were up 14 percent and services were up 1.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.140]   Healthcare orders excluding biopharma were up 6 percent, driven by a surge demand related
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.140]   to COVID-19.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:28.780]   This was partially assessed by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.780]   to COVID-19.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:35.220]   Examples like MR and intervention in healthcare systems, as well as contrast media and nuclear
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:42.260]   traces in pharmaceutical diagnostics, life sciences orders were up 10 percent.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:48.600]   Backlog was 17.4 billion down 6 percent sequentially and down 3 versus prior year due to the sale
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   of biopharma.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.460]   So excluding biopharma, backlog was up 1 percent sequentially and 4 versus prior year.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:01.140]   Revenue was up 2 percent organically and 1 percent excluding biopharma.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.740]   Healthcare systems revenue was up 2 percent with services and 3 percent with equipment
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.740]   flat.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.620]   Life sciences was up 4 percent.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.900]   Operating profit was up 10 percent organically.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:18.340]   Segment margin expanded 140 basis points organically or 30 basis points excluding biopharma.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:24.020]   This was driven by volume and cost productivity, offset by price and logistics pressures from
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.620]   COVID-19.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:32.620]   Next, on power, we had mixed results with equipment, top line strengths, offset by challenges in
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.620]   services.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.100]   Orders were up 14 percent organically.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.940]   Gas power orders were up 8 percent with equipment orders up 37 percent largely due to one-term
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.940]   key order.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.820]   We booked 2.2 gigawatt of orders for nine gas turbines.
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:53.980]   Gas power service orders were down 3 percent with contractual services down and transaction
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.460]   and upgrades roughly flat.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.540]   Powered portfolio orders were up 27 percent with strong equipment and services orders in
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.620]   spoon and power conversion.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:09.100]   Backlog closed at 85 billion flat sequentially and down 1 percent versus prior year.
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.340]   Gas backlog was 71 billion flat sequentially.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.060]   Revenue was down 12 percent organically, largely driven by services.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:25.260]   In gas power revenue was down 12 percent, gas power equipment revenue was up 4 percent organically
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.300]   on higher H-turbine mix.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:34.060]   We shipped seven gas turbines versus nine gas turbines in the first quarter of 19.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:39.380]   We helped our customers achieve commercial operations on over 32 units, translating almost
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.900]   4.7 gigawatts of new power added to the grid.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:50.340]   Gas power services revenue was down 19 percent organically, as outages and transaction sales
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:56.500]   pushed out of the quarter due to COVID-19 and we had lower revenue on higher margin upgrades.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.980]   Despite this, services would still have been down in the quarter.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:05.100]   This was driven by supply-based constraints on hot gas part parts and outage costs overall
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.580]   pressuring our CSA margin rate.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.100]   Power portfolio revenue was down 12 percent.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:16.660]   Businesses were driven by lower volumes across subsegments and still we had lower services
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.260]   back low convertibility in nuclear.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:24.340]   The decline was driven by outage timing and in power conversion we refined our sales parameter
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.140]   focused on higher margin market segments.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:36.260]   Operating profit was down 239 million and segment margin contracted 570 basis points organically.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.380]   While gas power fixed costs were down 9 percent sequentially and fixed versus prior year, this
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:48.740]   was more than upset by lower service volume and additional costs from COVID-19 disruption.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.060]   Next are renewables.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.060]   Continue revenue growth was more than upset by fulfillment and execution issues impacting
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.060]   profitability.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.500]   Orders were down 11 percent organically.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:06.100]   Equipment were down 11 as we cycle a stronger USPTC and services were down 23 percent.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:12.700]   A positive spot in the quarter was international orders which were up 11 percent.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:20.780]   Backlog of 26.5 billion was down 4 percent sequentially but up 5 percent versus prior year.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.660]   Revenue was up 28 percent organically.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:28.020]   This was mainly driven by onshore wind up 60 percent.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:34.260]   Onshore equipment revenue was up 81 percent with the new unit turbine delivery of 731 more
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:40.980]   than double prior year and repower kit delivers of 219 up 40 percent.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:46.340]   Onshore services revenue excluding repower kits was up 15 percent.
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:52.360]   Onshore order pricing index continues to stabilize at 1 percent in line with recent trends.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.980]   Grid revenue was down 8 percent mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones driven
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.620]   by COVID-19.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.980]   Operating loss was down 115 million.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:07.980]   This was driven by the supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 fulfillment delays and the
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:13.900]   non-recurrence of the non-cash gain from offshore wind contract termination in the prior year.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.460]   This was partially upset by higher onshore wind volume.
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:24.100]   Segment margin contracted 210 basis points mainly driven by the same items mentioned above
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:30.700]   and the range of execution issues were fixing at grid and hydro.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.820]   Moving to slide 8, starting with GE Capital.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:40.020]   In the quarter adjusted continue operations generated a net loss of 118 million.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:45.640]   This excludes the impact of the capital loss tax benefits utilized against biopharm again
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.500]   resulting in 88 million earnings.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:55.020]   Compared to prior year which excludes the U.S. tax reform benefit continuing net earnings
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.420]   was unfavorable by 154 million.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:03.700]   This was due to negative marks and impairments at GCAS and insurance lower gains and lower
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.700]   earnings from a smaller asset base.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.620]   This was partially upset by lower excess interest cost and SGNA.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.700]   We ended the quarter with 101 billion of assets excluding liquidity.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.740]   This was down 1 billion sequentially primarily driven by GCAS due to asset sales depreciation
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.740]   and collections partially upset by new volume.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:29.860]   Signals assets were flat sequentially as a decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:36.740]   by higher market rates was upset by the annual insurance capital contribution.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:42.140]   Supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continued to migrate to MUFG.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:48.220]   As noted earlier capital ended the quarter with 13.5 billion of liquidity.
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:54.580]   Capital also ended with 54.5 billion of debt which was down 4.5 billion sequentially driven
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.420]   by debt maturity.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:02.820]   This continued operations generated a net loss of 164 million which was unfavorable versus
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.980]   prior year by 200 million.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:11.660]   We still plan to provide the required support to GE Capital in line with insurance tax reform.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:18.140]   Next, just like our businesses corporate needs to adjust our new reality and we are continuing
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:24.540]   to take additional structural actions to rationalize costs and reduce the size at corporate.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:31.260]   Moving at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were 374 million 8% higher but that's primarily
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.740]   due to higher intercompany profit elimination which will partially upset by better digital
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.940]   performance from continued cost reduction actions.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:46.100]   Functions and operations were 25% lower primarily driven by GE Digital's improvement.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.580]   You can see from digital performance that the focus cost reduction programs are getting
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.580]   correction.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.940]   We continue to right size our functional costs across GE and push more accountability into
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.940]   the divisions.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:03.860]   Larry and I are conducting cost and cash reviews of each of the businesses with fresh eyes in
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:08.220]   the current environment so you can expect there will be more to come.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.220]   Stay tuned.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:16.460]   I have spent most of my career in leadership at lean decentralized companies.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:21.540]   Fundamentally I believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers businesses
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.500]   to take the right actions quickly.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:29.900]   This type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with COVID-19
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.620]   but also to be prepared to pivot to growth.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.660]   We're working toward this goal and there will be more to come.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:41.660]   With that, back to you Larry.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:51.580]   There's no question that COVID-19 is putting real pressure on our businesses.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:55.820]   Given that so much has changed and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:01.580]   from COVID-19, I would like to spend some time here discussing second quarter trending based
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:05.420]   on what we're seeing through the month of April.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.300]   Starting with aviation on slide nine.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:14.580]   Of all of our industrial segments, this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:19.500]   The rapid contraction of air travel has resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:24.740]   airlines suspend routes and ground large percentages of their fleets.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:29.080]   We'll cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail but on the
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.980]   other end of the spectrum demand for our military business remains strong.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:39.740]   To that end, we rebalance some of our capacity to meet this increased demand.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:44.540]   To offset some pressure in the commercial business, we're taking several steps that while painful
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.140]   preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:55.580]   We've previously announced $500 to $1 billion in costs and cash actions and we've now increased
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:34:02.900]   this targeting more than $1 billion in cost actions and more than $2 billion in cash actions.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:08.020]   This will be achieved through different initiatives some of which have been completed, others in
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.060]   flight as we speak.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:15.060]   These include a 10% reduction in aviation's total U.S. workforce and furloughs impacting
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:22.620]   50% of its U.S. maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufacturers will
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.940]   continue to monitor and potentially extend as required.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:35.580]   We're also focused on reducing the discretionary and cap expense and optimizing working capital.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.820]   I know aviation's decriminal margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:44.660]   and Carolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:48.100]   While we expect our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the second
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:53.420]   quarter, our expectations are that the cost action we're undertaking will improve decriminal
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.700]   margins in the back half of the year.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.500]   While there are many uncertainties, I expect that we will exit the year with a much lower
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.240]   decriminal margin than what you saw in the first quarter.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.780]   So make no mistake, driving improvement here is our number one focus.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.660]   As we think about the full year, we're tracking travel restrictions, carrier and passenger
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:18.980]   behavior, disease countermeasures and freight demand, all of which will impact aircraft
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.740]   departures and revenue passenger kilometers.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:27.820]   While we're seeing an unprecedented decline in 2020, we're taking action and David and
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:34.740]   the team are working proactively with our customers to navigate through this crisis.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:38.900]   So spending a little more time on commercial services, which represented $3.3 billion of
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.660]   revenue in the first quarter, let's go to slide 10.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.340]   As you can see on the left side, departures across the full industry were strong in the
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:50.180]   first quarter before rapidly declining in mid-March.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.980]   As we look at it this week, focused on the GE and CFM fleet, global departures are down
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:36:02.820]   approximately 75 percent, roughly 60 percent of the CFM fleet is parked today.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.100]   In line with this, we're also seeing significant headwinds and global shop visits, which were
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:12.020]   down low double digits in the first quarter as airlines defer short-term maintenance and
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:17.020]   we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better, with some potential to moderate in
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.620]   the latter half of the year depending on the variables just outlined.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.180]   Based on what we're seeing through the month of April in the second quarter, we're seeing
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:31.420]   shop visits down roughly 60 percent and CSA billings down roughly 50 percent.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:37.300]   Additionally, we expect the significant reduction in utilization is likely to continue to pressure
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.100]   our CSA margins.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:45.700]   That said, when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time, GE is well
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:51.500]   positioned with the largest and youngest installed base of all engine manufacturers.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:59.220]   Additionally, roughly 62 percent of our GE CFM fleet has seen one shop visit for the last
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:03.220]   and this will generate demand upon recovery.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.980]   We have more narrow bodies that are 10 years or younger than the narrow body installed
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:13.180]   base of the rest of the industry and when we see a pickup and air travel demand, we expect
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.400]   narrow bodies will recover most quickly.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:22.180]   Overall, it was a challenging quarter and we're expecting additional pressure here in the second
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:28.980]   but our cost action will alleviate some of the pressure in the second half of 2020.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:34.820]   Moving to commercial engines, which represented $1.5 billion revenue in the first quarter,
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.060]   in light of COVID-19, air framers are producing at a lower rate.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.100]   Based on what we're seeing through the month of April, in the second quarter we see installed
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:49.420]   engines down roughly 45 percent and spare engines down roughly 60 percent year on year, attributable
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:54.120]   to the delivery deferrals in addition to the already planned lower production rate on
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.420]   the 737 max.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:02.820]   In the near term, we're rightsizing production capacity and actively managing the supply base.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.860]   We have very strong relationships with the air framers and an attractive value proposition
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.580]   is evidenced by a multi-year backlog.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:14.040]   As you'll see on the right, we have strong positions, sole source on two of the biggest
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.180]   new engine entrants and a 65 percent win rate on the other.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:23.740]   While we acknowledge there's pressure on near-term demand for new aircraft, these stats demonstrate
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:29.020]   to customers see the value of GE technology.
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:34.940]   We're taking the right actions to be well positioned for the post pandemic world.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.900]   Moving to healthcare, which consists of healthcare systems and PDX.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:44.220]   In the second quarter to date, we're seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:49.220]   in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 within healthcare systems.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.540]   Now these product orders including ventilators have increased one and a half to two times
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:59.100]   versus pre-pandemic levels, but at the same time we're seeing reduced demand for other
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.660]   diagnostic products as certain procedures are deferred or canceled around the world.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:08.940]   To be clear, these other diagnostics are still essential and often associated with saving
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:17.040]   lives in areas including oncology and cardiology, but are currently deprioritized.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.740]   PDX is a similar story.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:23.620]   This is a high margin this is made about contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with procedures
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.260]   that are being deferred or canceled right now.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:32.740]   Several HCS product lines and most of PDX is down as much as 50 percent versus pre-pandemic
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.100]   levels.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.360]   While these dynamics vary by country, there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.120]   experience different stages of the virus.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:48.060]   Taking China for example, as hospitals come back online, we're seeing a ramp in previously
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:53.700]   deferred procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:59.260]   Healthcare is accelerating its planned transformation to expand margins post biopharma by reducing
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:06.420]   head count, fixed costs, discretionary spend and marketing spend, prioritizing R&D, deferring
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.980]   CAPX and optimizing working capital.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.900]   Looking forward, we're most focused on the following indicators for healthcare.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:20.060]   Hospital admission and occupancy rates and increase in non-COVID-19 procedures, changes
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:26.380]   in hospital CAPX budgets, government spending on healthcare broadly and development of COVID-19
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.780]   test treatments and vaccines.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.300]   Based on our experience in China and the market in April, we expect to be down in the second
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.740]   quarter with potential recovery afterwards.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:45.300]   COVID-19 has highlighted the need to build and truly invest and scale a new digitized infrastructure
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.300]   and quickly.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:51.820]   We're committed to our investment in our digital Edison platform and solutions like Neural Virtual
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:57.140]   Care Solution, which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous ventilated patients
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:05.220]   simultaneously helping to expand their capacity while reducing their risk of exposure.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.460]   As our digital healthcare journey continues, we're at the center of an ecosystem striving
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.780]   for precision health.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:17.980]   I'm very proud of the work our team is doing to combat COVID-19.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:23.780]   Moving to power on slide 13, we'll talk to the current trending in the second quarter
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:29.140]   to date in dynamics at gas power and power portfolio.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.500]   Starting with gas power equipment, while we're monitoring and managing supply chain disruptions,
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:39.940]   as of today, we still see a path to 45 to 50 gas turbine deliveries this year.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.900]   But our order's profile and therefore cash down payments worth several hundred million
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:50.220]   dollars are likely weaker due to IPP pressures in the U.S. and Mexico as we expect that deal
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.980]   financing will become harder through the year.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:42:00.900]   Additionally, with oil price pressure impacting Middle East and SSA investment, including demand
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:06.100]   for new LNG, we are expecting a longer road to normalization.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:13.340]   Ultimately, we're sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin accretive backlog
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.980]   with disciplined execution.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.740]   In services, approximately 20% of planned averages are shifting from the first half of this year
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.180]   due to COVID-19 field labor constraints.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.700]   We're also seeing pressure on upgrades, primarily in the Middle East, where low oil prices are
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.180]   impacting customer budgets.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:36.740]   We are seeing GE gas turbine utilization in the U.S. up mid-single digits due to low gas
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:42.900]   prices and the shift from coal, but utilization globally is down low double digits due to lower
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.860]   electricity demand.
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.900]   In power portfolio, our steam business is most impacted.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:54.660]   Factory closures pressured our steam operations, including one facility in Wuhan, which was
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.240]   closed for approximately eight weeks in the first quarter.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.700]   Today, we're back up to more than 70% of capacity.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:07.340]   The global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in India driven by government
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.340]   restrictions.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:13.500]   Overall, we're seeing about 30% of outers shift from the first half of this year to the
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:19.500]   second half, with another 10% to 15% pushing into next year.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.500]   Our power businesses are taking several measures to offset these pressures.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:30.540]   In the first quarter, we reduced head count by 700, notified approximately 1,300 contractors,
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:35.740]   implemented a hiring freeze, and in line with the demand profile, we are taking even further
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.460]   actions.
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:44.620]   This will serve to reduce fixed costs in 2020 and drive benefits in 2021.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.760]   Looking forward, we're tracking a number of items, including timing of our gas turbine
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:53.860]   new order closure, service outages and volume, leak utilization is the energy mix, and fuel
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:59.820]   prices are impacting each region differently, supplier impacts and project execution, billing
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.500]   milestones and customer collections.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.860]   We're targeting to have our accelerated cost out measures drive organic margin expansion
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.500]   despite these demand changes.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:19.060]   Moving to slide 14 on renewables, there was a limited impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:23.740]   and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:28.740]   As we've said, we think about renewables and three distinct operating pools, starting with
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:33.700]   onshore wind, while we continue to deliver at record levels in the Americas.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:38.740]   We are seeing supply chain disruption at our LM wind facilities and we're monitoring key
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:44.020]   commercial milestones such as permitting and financing, which could potentially cause timing
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.020]   delays.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:51.400]   In offshore wind, certification for our industry leading turbine, the Hollywood X, remains
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   on track.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:59.460]   We're also on plan to start delivering on our 80 unit, six megawatt commitments to EDF.
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:03.780]   After completion of this project in 2021, we expect to start shifting production to the
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.780]   Hollywood X.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:10.500]   We're also monitoring financial closure of 2020 deals.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:16.020]   Grid and hydro, our two turnarounds, are impacted by supply chain disruptions with over half
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.860]   of our grid facilities now operating below full capacity.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:26.300]   At grid automation, we're also impacted by lower book to bill order conversion.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:30.660]   Across all three of these pools, we're increasing cost out and restructuring and we've identified
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:34.460]   several hundred million dollars of additional actions.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:39.060]   Longer term, a lower cost structure will benefit renewables.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:43.340]   Relating to the global supply chain, we're focused on the safe reopening of our plants
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:48.740]   globally and then optimizing the workforce and plant load levels.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:53.740]   Before we were expecting a larger impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter and by business,
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:59.780]   we're tracking 20 and 21 demand impact on progress collections and potential site delays in onshore
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:00.780]   wind.
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:06.060]   The risk of financing delays associated with deals at offshore project site delays at grid
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:11.900]   and hydro and the backlog at grid.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.100]   On slide 15, within GE Capital, our GCAPs and insurance businesses are where we are feeling
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.860]   the largest impacts so I'll keep my comments focused there.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:26.740]   First, GCAPs is better positioned today than in previous downturns with better asset quality,
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:31.480]   less customer concentration and more geographic diversity.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:37.020]   That said, we're preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments as well as lease restructurings
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:42.420]   and we've had approximately 80% of our customers seek short term deferrals.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:49.140]   As you may have seen, we've agreed with Boeing on rebalancing of our 737 match order book.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:54.700]   Second at insurance, market and rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:47:00.460]   portfolio and reinvestment yields therefore we're deploying capital to capture market
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.620]   dislocation investment opportunities.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:09.100]   We're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year and similar
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:13.460]   to the industrial segments we're implementing incremental cost and cash actions.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:18.700]   Looking forward we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales at GCAPs and
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.700]   insurance.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:26.580]   Our seasoned teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period.
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.260]   So to close, our priorities are clear.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:34.780]   We rapidly mobilized our team and the face of COVID-19 with our top priority being the
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.500]   health and safety of our employees.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:44.620]   And overall, the priorities we reviewed with you at the outlet call remain intact.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.820]   We're facing into our near term realities while continuing to manage GE for the long term.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:55.180]   When the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century, our team is rising to the challenge
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:48:00.220]   with humility, transparency and focus.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:05.580]   We continue to deliver value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:10.700]   goods supplying vital health care equipment and keeping the lights on.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:15.300]   And while there are many unknowns there will be another side.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.120]   Plains will fly again.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:23.460]   Health care will normalize and modernize and the world still needs more efficient resilient
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:24.460]   energy.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:28.420]   At the same time, we're embracing this new reality.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.940]   We're redefining winning and we're executing our plan.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:38.620]   The costs and cash and actions we've taken you through this morning are a major result.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:44.420]   These moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multiyear transformation to make GE a stronger,
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:50.360]   number and more valuable company and I am confident that GE will emerge stronger.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.620]   With that, Steve, let's go to questions.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:55.620]   Great.
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:01.740]   Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:07.540]   again and ask one question and a follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.620]   Brandon, can you please open the line?
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.020]   Yes, thank you sir.
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:13.180]   We'll now begin the question and answer session.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.540]   If you have a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.680]   If you'd like to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:25.340]   If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up your handset first before dialing.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:30.380]   Once again, if you have a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad.
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.660]   From vertical research, we have Jeff Sprague.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.900]   Please go ahead.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.180]   Thank you.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.180]   Good morning everyone.
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.660]   Help everyone as well.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.020]   Thanks for all the great details.
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.020]   Good morning, Jeff.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.020]   Good morning.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:51.140]   I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on how you kind of view the asset
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:55.260]   quality of the contractual service agreements and the like.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:02.540]   There's a lot of assets there; obviously there's at least a temporary impairment of cash flows.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.060]   How does that test work?
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:08.580]   Have you done it yet and are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.380]   be thinking about?
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:25.180]   Jeff, I think if we look at the service backlog, broadly, just under $325 billion for the contractual
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:31.180]   company, the vast majority of that $234 billion is in aviation.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.860]   I suspect that's where you're most focused.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:44.260]   We go through those backlog reviews and the CSA reviews on a regular basis.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:53.700]   What we've done here over the last seven, eight weeks is really tighten and quicken the review
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:51:00.520]   process that we do with the businesses, both at aviation and at GCAS.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:07.980]   What we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest and, if you will, most accurate
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:14.540]   information possible with respect to customer risk given everything that's going on.
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.900]   We do that on a regular basis.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:23.660]   We did that at the end of the first quarter in closing, much as we do every quarter clearly
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:32.740]   we've got a fluid situation and I think the modest charges that we took, the modest changes
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:37.060]   in the first quarter clearly are going to play out as we go through the course of the year.
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.860]   We can't really scope that for you today.
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:47.860]   If you look at the CSA book in aviation, for example, as we went through the mechanics
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:54.480]   of the future billings, the future costs related to those billings, based on the information
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.740]   at the time, it was really just $100 million adjustment, non-cash of course, which is why
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.740]   you see a little bit of the earnings cash dynamic.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:12.300]   Certainly as we go forward we're going to be updating those adjustments and again we
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:18.700]   would expect that we would see more of that given what the airlines are doing with their
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:24.780]   planes, but I think it's important to keep in mind, again, these are 10 to 15 year agreements
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:32.260]   as you know and those adjustments are taken in the context of that particularly extended
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.260]   time period.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.260]   Great.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:40.020]   Thanks for that and just as a follow-up if I could, I know you don't want to get real precise
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:47.500]   on guidance but you are pointing us to a further decline in cash flow in Q2, which isn't surprising
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:56.020]   quite frankly, but could you bracket that at all for us what we should expect for Q2 and
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:00.700]   any high level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint?
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:09.980]   Yes, Jeff, I think that we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and didn't want
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:16.560]   to take an attempt at framing formal guidance here today in light of all of this flu and
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:22.860]   all of this is still evolving here and I think the tact we took was really to try to share
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:30.380]   as much with you as we possibly could in terms of the April detail business by business and
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:35.140]   acknowledge that we're going to see a more challenging second quarter here given the full
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.720]   impact of COVID and the like.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.160]   But beyond that, I think that's really where we are.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.540]   We know we've got to get to work on the cost and the cash actions.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:51.420]   That's why you see us doubling that activity and aviation, stepping it up elsewhere around
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.420]   the company.
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:54:00.700]   So the $2 billion of cost, the $3 billion of cash will clearly help us later on in the year
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:08.660]   if those actions take root, but for today I think that's really what we're -- that's
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.700]   what we know and that's what we're comfortable sharing.
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:11.700]   Thanks.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.900]   Best of luck, Larry.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.900]   Thanks.
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:18.540]   From Morgan Stanley, we have Josh Pokers-Winsky.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.380]   Please go ahead.
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:28.000]   Josh, your line is open.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Josh.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:36.980]   Josh, you might be -- Josh, are you there?
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:43.540]   Why don't we -- Brandon, let's move on and come back to Josh.
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.540]   Okay.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:45.540]   Sure.
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.540]   Next question we have from Bank of America.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.540]   We have Andrew Oden.
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.540]   Please go ahead.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.540]   Yes.
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.540]   Good morning.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.740]   Can you hear me?
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:53.740]   Andrew?
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:54.740]   Yep.
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:55.740]   Andrew, are you okay?
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:56.740]   Well -- Yeah, just a question.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.740]   I can hear you.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:02.820]   Thank you so much and good luck to everybody.
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:12.020]   So, run rate minus 60% in terms of shop visits, 5% on CSAs, do you think you continue to trend
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:16.940]   at this level in the second quarter or is there more downside?
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:25.940]   Andrew, the -- I think you're referring to page nine and the slide deck.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:28.780]   I think this is what we're seeing here.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:40.100]   Yeah, I think this is what we're seeing right now and given what the carriers have said publicly
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:47.700]   what they're doing, we think these are good likely near-end run rates to share with you.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:54.140]   We're not trying to offer up a definitive view as to the next several quarters, but this
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:59.420]   is what we're seeing right now in the second quarter, for sure.
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:06.520]   My follow-up question on spare engine sales, I think minus 60%.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:11.900]   Have we lost these or will these come back when the situation normalizes?
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:17.460]   Maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.460]   the next couple of years.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:24.180]   Thank you so much.
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:34.740]   Andrew, we were ramping spares with both the LEAP1A and the LEAP1B as the narrowbody market
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:42.700]   was taking off typical early in the life of an engine activity.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:50.140]   We are clearly seeing that soften, not necessarily going to zero as preparations are being made
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:54.660]   for the return to service to the max.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:59.580]   I don't think that opportunity is lost, but I think much of what we're seeing in aviation
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:03.700]   broadly, it will be pushed out for a few years.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:10.340]   Again, I don't think we're taking a definitive view as to what year, what quarter things get
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:19.340]   back to, if you will, a normalized 2019 level, but we recognize the discussions out there
[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:23.580]   about this being a multi-year recovery, gradual, slow.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:30.840]   I think we're embracing that reality and that applies really across the portfolio both on
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:36.360]   the OE side as well as the aftermarket spares included.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.420]   Thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.860]   Thank you.
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:46.540]   For Amelius Research, we have Scott Davis.
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.740]   Please go ahead.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.500]   Hey, good morning guys and welcome Carolina.
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   Thank you.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.340]   Good morning Larry.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:02.400]   Any way to think about the cost actions as it relates to kind of structural versus more
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:08.700]   kind of pandemic short term related?
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.700]   Sure.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:17.700]   Well I would say Scott, as you well know, that when we're in a mode like this, you're moving
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:22.800]   as quickly as you possibly can almost anywhere that you can.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:28.420]   So if you look at what we've announced in aviation, the doubling of those activities today, the
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:37.200]   broadening across the company, if you look at the tally today, there is a decidedly short
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:44.020]   term bias there that Carolina and I are going to be working with the CEOs over the coming
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:49.320]   weeks to transition to a more permanent action, right?
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:54.900]   If you look at what we did in aviation, for example, in terms of the temporary lack of
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:59:00.580]   costs, that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure and that business on a variable
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:07.420]   basis to these shockingly fast changes in demand.
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.620]   You might categorize that as temporary.
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:16.000]   We need to work through the changes on a more permanent basis that are required in light
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.300]   of the length of the recovery that we're looking at.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:25.820]   So we have confidence in these numbers that we're sharing today, the two billion of costs,
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.300]   the three billion of cash.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:33.480]   There's a bit of a tactical bias today just given how fresh this is, but we will be leaning
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:39.420]   in toward making more than permanent recognizing that at the end of the day there will be a
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:47.620]   bit of a mix, be it head count related discretionary spend on the cost side in addition to some
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:52.740]   of the working capital and certainly the cap X reduction, the Carolina reference, the 25%
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.100]   reduction year on year.
[00:59:55.100 --> 01:00:04.600]   So a lot going on and by no means is these headlines today the end.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.660]   It's very much at work and in progress.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:14.780]   Okay, that's helpful, Larry, and we think the $20 billion came to you pretty much about
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.780]   perfect timing.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:22.900]   Does that money just have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as is for the year?
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:28.860]   Or is it just such a big number you can start to parse some of it out thinking in terms of
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:37.460]   whittling down some of the debt that you can manage?
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:43.580]   Well, it did come at a good time.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.500]   There's no question.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:52.340]   That's why we put the emphasis in the biopharmists set up on certainty.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:58.300]   We want to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the healthcare
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.300]   options.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:06.940]   Carolina, anything you want to add relative to managing liquidity versus leverage right
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.940]   here?
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:15.900]   I think it's important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared to before
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.900]   COVID and it's very important for us.
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:23.900]   Of course leverage is important, but liquidity is very important and we end the quarter with
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:30.380]   47 billion cash and that's really to cover 18 billion of the capital long-term debt
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:36.540]   maturities now through 21 and actually after the April actions we are down to 13 billion
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:41.820]   of the charity for 2021, almost all of that in capital.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:47.060]   I would also say we expect to have around 20 billion in total credit lines going forward
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:49.780]   and that's really in line with our risk appetite.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:57.540]   We have the new 15 billion three-year RCF that I mentioned and 5 billion will be on 20 billion
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.540]   of credit lines.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:03.880]   I think we just say that we really intend to maintain a high level of cash, I would say
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:09.060]   to maximize flexibility and that's why we're taking these actions, also to do risk balance
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:15.580]   sheet and basically prudently manage our liquidity in these very challenging external environmental
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:18.100]   times.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:22.820]   That makes sense and thank you and good luck to you guys.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:23.820]   Thank you.
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.820]   Thanks Scott.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:25.820]   Be well.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:31.180]   Let's try Josh Porcos-Winsky again from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead sir.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:34.180]   Hi guys, can you hear me this time?
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.180]   Yes?
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.180]   Yes.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.940]   Clearly Josh, good morning.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:42.260]   Awesome and hope everyone is as well that got earlier comments.
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:48.980]   Larry, can you just give us a sense and I know you guys have data going back eons and aviation.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:57.780]   How the impact of retirements and cannibalizations kind of make more of a U shape versus what
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:04.500]   the air traffic may look like, is there a natural lag between when folks start flying again
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:10.460]   and when shop visits can happen just as a function of kind of using up some of the runtime on
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.900]   otherwise idle assets?
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:23.020]   Well Josh, certainly we have revisited the history and the team is well versed in what
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:25.860]   we've seen in years past.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:36.580]   Sure we've seen anything kind of on par with this, but there's no question there's going
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:42.860]   to be a bias on the part of some as some of these fleet reductions play out to retire
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:51.780]   some of the older aircraft and that will factor into the aftermarket, much like some of the
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:04:00.780]   dynamics around green time and how here in the short term folks try to preserve cash in
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.780]   their business.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:08.900]   So I'm not sure that there is necessarily an exact model that captures what all the carriers
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:13.060]   and aggregate are going to do here, a model that offers great precision.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:17.740]   I think we do know that the combination of these factors is going to create pressure
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:26.100]   for us here in the short term, I think what's most important for our business really is cycles
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:34.540]   much more so than revenue passenger miles and as we see schedules come back as we work our
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:40.620]   way through the pandemic that will put us back on I think better footing, but here in the
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:45.460]   short term I think we're acknowledging that we're going to see shop visits and CSA buildings
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.340]   take on some real pressure due to the downturn.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.340]   Understood.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.860]   Thanks, I'll leave it there.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:59.300]   From JP Morgan, we have Steve Tusa, please go ahead.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.300]   Hey guys, good morning.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:06.140]   Hey Steve, good morning.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:11.700]   In early March you guys had that slide that showed two to four billion and free cash flow
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.300]   guidance, which is obviously off the table.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:20.060]   You also talked about things growing in 21 and 22 and off that kind of three billion dollar
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:28.620]   base I think most research and numbers I saw were kind of in that six billion dollar range
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:31.980]   of free cash flows, growth off of that level.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:41.340]   Are the out year numbers still at all legit or are you withdrawing that long term outlook
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:46.860]   as well?
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:53.620]   Steve I think we have immediately been focused on taking the right actions both the cost,
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:59.940]   the cash, the balance sheet actions here in the short term in the face of this unprecedented
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.940]   pandemic.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:08.740]   We've taken guidance off for the year, we're not putting it back on today just given the
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:16.220]   undue uncertainty of it all, right, so I don't think we're trying to get out any further than
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.220]   that.
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:23.940]   I appreciate the question but I think for purposes of today we're really just trying to frame
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:30.020]   for folks what we're seeing but that said, however long it takes us to work through this
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:37.460]   I think we feel very good about our ability to come out stronger and get back on a positive
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.780]   cash flow growth trajectory.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:42.260]   Got it, got it.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:45.740]   Carolina anything you would add to that?
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:52.300]   Well no I think it's important to acknowledge that by taking out costs now and part of it
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:59.460]   being structural that gives us sort of as well as mitigating the decrementals that helps improving
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:05.200]   the incrementals, the outer years I mean that will depend on the recovery on the industries
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.200]   as well.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:11.020]   That's, I would say, one of the most impossible to speak to today.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.180]   Right and I guess how much on that structural law side?
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.180]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:22.380]   Yeah, no I'm just one other point I think worth mentioning and I think what we're acknowledging
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:28.020]   here is that assistance played out in March and what we're seeing already in April, right,
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:33.740]   it really is hitting us from mixed perspective hard.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.720]   Our highest margin businesses are really feeling it here.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:47.380]   I would think that on the recovery we would see it swing the other way so when we get back
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:54.140]   and come off a bottom we should have positive mixed effect really across the board particularly
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.100]   in aviation and healthcare.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.400]   Your second question Steve was relative to the cost actions and how much permanent, how
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:04.980]   much not permanent?
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.260]   Yeah, I know I guess how much is that going to cost you I mean like you know to come up
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:14.500]   with two to three billion dollars of cost in cash you know you've done, you cut your restructuring
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.680]   last year pretty significantly and you needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.380]   I mean most companies kind of one for one, how much is this stuff going to cost you this
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.440]   year on a cash basis?
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:37.620]   Yeah, I think what we have said previously is we were going to be down off of last year
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:43.780]   from an expense and from a cash perspective I think we're probably going to end up more
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:50.420]   or less in line, right, keep in mind that some of the cost actions like furloughs don't carry
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:56.800]   restructuring charge with that, right, because they aren't permanent so part of what we're
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:03.900]   trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary costs but all the while if we can make more
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.760]   structural moves we want to make sure we've got room to do that.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:12.340]   But I'd say right now assume that it be relatively flat year on year but it's Carolina indicated
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:17.620]   in her remarks we want to try to do more if we can.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.620]   Great.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.660]   All right thanks a lot guys.
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:20.660]   Thanks Steve.
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:28.140]   From UBS we have Marcus Medermeyer, please go ahead.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:31.100]   Hi good morning Larry, Caroline and Steve.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.900]   Let me maybe follow up on the – Marcus good morning.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:36.460]   Hey good morning.
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:45.580]   Within the year so in year 10Q you referenced the data numbers of 48% RPK reduction is – and
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:51.100]   I know obviously flight hours and RPKs are two different stories but is that sort of a
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:56.460]   kind of scenario that you're flying through internally and I'm just trying to get a sense
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:02.300]   what that would mean if we look at our sort of like 19 aviation cash as a baseline sort
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:09.460]   of like where on that type of scenario we could end up particularly looking at sort of what
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:15.880]   you've mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have I think 62% of engines built ahead
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:20.420]   of shop visit one which arguably are the engines that are on the narrow bodies coming back
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:25.260]   first because they're probably the youngest in the fleet.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.260]   Right.
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:33.640]   Just trying to get a sense for within the year how you're thinking about that.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:43.160]   So I think that given what we highlighted relative to the April experience and the near term projection
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:50.900]   of that there's no question that we're going to continue to see the pressure on cash at
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:54.460]   aviation that we've seen here of late.
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:11:04.140]   That will undoubtedly be our biggest headwind.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:11.740]   No, sure, but shop visit we heard sort of the numbers that you said but did you do sort
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:20.580]   of internal stress tests around where you could end up or is that just something that you
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:24.560]   did too early to comment?
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:35.960]   No, no, no, there's plenty of planning for again an extended slowdown here.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.580]   We're embracing this reality to the fullest extent possible.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:45.000]   We are not expecting this to bounce back in the near term.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.500]   So we flag in the queue the IATA numbers.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.620]   We also reference others.
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:53.900]   You see it in our own departure data here in April, right?
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.900]   We are way down.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:59.900]   That has a direct feed in the shop visits, CSA buildings and the like.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:09.460]   So we're adapting to this new environment confident that it will recover, but we're simply not
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:20.120]   trying to assume the pressure abates anytime soon, witness the cost and the cash actions
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   that we're taking.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120]   Sure.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.120]   Okay.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.120]   No, I appreciate that.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:30.900]   And maybe as a follow up quickly on the capital side, do you anticipate any change in the capital
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.100]   support there for insurance in particular?
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:38.980]   You referenced that a little bit in the prepared remarks, I think $2 billion is sort of the
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:39.980]   parent number.
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:46.460]   How are you thinking about that at the moment?
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:53.380]   On the parent support to capital and on the insurance, let's take a step back then.
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:13:03.400]   So in 19, the capital had an intrusion from $4 billion, and the estimate for this year
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.500]   is $2 billion on insurance funding.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:14.180]   And those $2 billion, you know, that's significantly lower than the year before, we estimated that
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:19.120]   the parent will need to support roughly in mind with this, but some variables are still open
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:25.100]   and that depends on G capital itself, right, to G capital earnings, the LR2, the capital
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:30.060]   ending assets, liquidity levels, but basically it's about $2 billion as it looks now.
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:35.860]   And I would also say going forward, which is a great thing to follow up, we do continue
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:42.040]   to anticipate further funding, and that would be again through a combination of G capital
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:48.940]   itself, LR2, liquidity and the future earnings and on top of that possible capital contributions
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.940]   from G.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:56.300]   Thank you.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:58.540]   From Coen & Co., we have Gautam Khanna.
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:13:59.540]   Please go ahead.
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:00.540]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.540]   Good morning guys.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.540]   Good morning.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.540]   Two questions.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:15.900]   So at Aviation, it sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up, the spare's business, the
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:23.900]   aftermarket, the $15 billion commercial aftermarket business will lag ASM growth because of a younger
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:31.020]   fleet emerging, you know, a surge of use serviceable material and the like, hard outs, and obviously
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:36.260]   lower spares provisioning as the OE rates come down 30% to 50%.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:43.980]   I guess first question is, when do you anticipate aviation free cash flow getting to break even?
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:50.580]   Is it even possible before calendar 22 in that type of environment?
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:58.420]   And then I have a follow up.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:03.940]   I'm not sure we would buy into the premise per se, right?
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:14.220]   I mean, we are a cycles business, much more so than any other indicator and those cycles
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:19.100]   are going to have to come back before the passengers do.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:23.500]   As you indicate, the age of the fleet will help us over time.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.940]   There could be some short term headwinds.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.100]   So we'll see how that plays out.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:37.980]   I think what we're acknowledging here is that we've been hit from a free cash perspective
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:45.100]   in our biggest and best cash generator at Aviation.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:55.820]   But we're really not getting into much more in terms of the free cash forecast on a multi
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:56.820]   year basis.
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:57.820]   It's too soon.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:03.660]   There's just too many moving pieces for us to be that before we're leaning at this point.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:08.660]   We wish we could be, it's just not where we are.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.340]   Just to follow up, obviously 2020 is a tough year.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:19.700]   We're going to have some cash burn, 2021 unclear, but certainly doesn't seem like an aviation.
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:23.980]   We're going to have a strong recovery.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:27.980]   So as we emerge from this, we're going to have more leverage.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:32.820]   I guess the question is, you guys have made some asset sales to deleverage.
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:41.460]   What else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster?
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:46.940]   Is there any other things that you guys are exploring or that you might explore that's
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:17:00.020]   different than what you've done over the past year?
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.020]   Thank you.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:28.760]   We are committed to our deleveraging target less than two and a half times on the industrial
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.760]   side.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:35.500]   And I think you've seen us make a lot of progress year to date, which I hope underscores the
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:42.460]   seriousness of that objective, both on the GE side right, I think it's 7 billion of debt
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:48.820]   reductions in the quarter and that capital, I think it's up to 10 on a year to date basis
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.700]   given some of the things we did in April.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:59.120]   Clearly it's going to take us a while longer here to hit those targets like I suspect most
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:04.300]   companies, but in terms of doing anything new or different, I think we're going to continue
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:09.940]   to try to run these businesses as best we can, be as disciplined as we can on the capital
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:16.460]   front, be smart and thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations like pension
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:21.980]   as you've seen us relative to the plan design and some of the settlement options.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:28.740]   So I'm not sure there necessarily new plays per se, but we'll continue to look at every
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:33.060]   option available to continue to strengthen the company, strengthen the balance sheet, bring
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:37.940]   those leverage levels down in the face of COVID-19.
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:43.340]   Caroline, I'm sorry, I jumped in there, did anything to add there?
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:48.520]   I would just add to the leverage comment also the liquidity that at times like this, you
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:53.220]   know, you do look at the liquidity and I think it's important to say that we really want
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:58.940]   to maintain a high level of cash maximizer flexibility and you have seen the de-risking
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:05.800]   activities that we have made to sort of push out the debt in the further years, so we keep
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.300]   optionality.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.300]   Thank you.
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:15.540]   Yeah, and I think to that it's just important for us all to remember we ended the quarter
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:22.100]   with 47 billion of liquidity on the back of the biopharma action and some of the other
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.460]   things that we have done.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:30.540]   So we'll continue to be nimble and flexible, mindful of our obligations and our reality.
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:37.060]   Okay, from Barclays we have Julian Mitchell.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.180]   Please go ahead.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:41.900]   Hi, good morning.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.300]   Maybe just a question.
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.300]   Marie Julian?
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.300]   Good morning.
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:51.060]   Maybe just the first question around the working capital dynamics and the free cash flow at
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:58.540]   aviation, I guess there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:05.540]   down draft you get a working capital cash offset to an extent and then it reverses whenever
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.780]   the sales come back.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:13.660]   Could you just update us on how you see the working capital cash impact at G Aviation sort
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:19.220]   of in the early stages now in this downturn, what you would expect to happen to working
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:25.620]   capital when things recover and if there's any major difference on the cash dynamics
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:32.860]   of the power-by-the-hour type service relative to the ad hoc spares activity in aviation?
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:39.220]   Julian, I would say --
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:56.460]   Yeah, with respect to working capital, I think our primary challenge is really inventory
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.460]   at aviation, right?
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:04.740]   We came into this year knowing we were going to have to adjust to a different schedule
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:13.340]   with the max chasing the step up at Airbus with the 320neo while dealing with a good bit
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:21.100]   of past due on the commercial side both OE and aftermarket while having pretty good military
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.820]   demand to contend with.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:31.820]   That all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from a cash flow perspective
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:38.100]   was an inventory at aviation in the quarter, so that's what we're going to be most focused
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:44.260]   trying to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies, adjust to the reduced production schedules,
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:51.380]   the lower aftermarket requirements while continuing to take care of the military business.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:59.220]   That's a complex supply chain undertaking, but the team, as you can imagine, is keenly
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:04.780]   focused on using some of the lean tools, working with our supply base to make sure that we not
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:13.500]   only take the cost out of the business, but bring those inventory levels down in light
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.620]   of current demand.
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:18.780]   But should we expect?
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:34.020]   The second part of your question, I may have missed that in aviation, you have the drop
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:39.220]   in EBITDA in the downturn and the recovery in EBITDA in the early part of the upturn.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:46.520]   I was just trying to understand on working capital, is that cash impact counter cyclical or is
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:53.340]   it pro cyclical, so you're getting a working capital outflow through the downturn as well
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:23:02.580]   as the EBITDA decline?
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:07.660]   I understand the high level dynamic there that you're alluding to.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:13.820]   I think right now the simple reality of aviation given the pressures and the cross currents
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:17.780]   is that it is a negative and we need to work to improve it.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:23.420]   How much of a tailwind could it be at this point in the cycle?
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.180]   I think it's too early to tell.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:32.720]   We've got to get on the improvement path first, Julian, to be able to take that potential
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.140]   and deliver it in the financials as a reality.
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.140]   Thank you.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:44.720]   The second question was just around the operational issues, so I think it sounds like the cost
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:50.620]   out tailwind should build through the year, but in Q1 you had some operational issues in
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:58.700]   power on the service side, steep decrementals even with the fixed cost down 16%, renewables
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.300]   the margins were down despite a big revenue increase.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:08.100]   So I guess what's the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:15.060]   these cost savings over the balance of the year?
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:20.380]   Well I think you have to take it business by business, right?
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:28.380]   If you look at what happened in power clearly the push out by customers because of their
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:34.700]   own site restrictions and by us on the back of the travel restrictions really pushed a
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:42.300]   lot of high margin revenue out of the quarter and probably out of the first half.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:52.100]   That was on top of some cost pressures of our own making which we need to improve upon.
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:25:01.500]   But I think in power I believe that the team is doing a very nice job working off the so
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:06.620]   called inheritance taxes, driving real cost improvements, you see that in the head count
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:12.180]   reductions here in the first quarter and as we get to a more normalized service environment
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:17.460]   I think you'll continue to see that turnaround continue to take flight.
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:21.180]   I think in renewables Julian it's a different dynamic.
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:28.760]   Yes we had phenomenal revenue growth in the quarter double the onshore turbine deliveries
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.660]   here in the U.S. got a little bit of a better price, got about a point of price which is encouraging
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:41.540]   to see but it is by nature a very low gross margin business so the growth is in high calorie
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:43.380]   unfortunately.
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:50.180]   We had a few, well we figure one offs but they're not one offs until they go away permanently
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:53.460]   cost and execution issues.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:59.760]   All the while the turnarounds in hydro and grid are I think moving forward but it's early
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:07.100]   days and they have a number of inheritance taxes that will take a few years to work through.
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:12.480]   So I think the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate those turnarounds
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.940]   in power and renewables.
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:20.340]   They're dealing with different dynamics in the respective businesses and that's really
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:26.020]   why I think I have the confidence to say that you should expect a decremental margin sequentially
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:33.540]   to improve that the restructuring and the cost actions should present themselves in improved
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:41.020]   decrementals in the back half but we've got work to do to make that happen.
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:44.680]   Great thank you.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.260]   From Wolf Research we have Nigel Kohi please go ahead.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.260]   Thanks Julian.
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:53.380]   Thanks good morning everyone and Karina great to see you on board.
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:27:00.800]   So look we appreciate all the color in the slides and the additional color in the queue.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:06.620]   So Larry is it now a base case that industrial free cash flow will be negative and maybe
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:13.660]   just address the risk of significant cash burn this year or is there enough on the cost
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:17.620]   out and the working capital side to maybe mitigate some of that pressure and keep the industrial
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:22.900]   free cash relatively steady.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:31.860]   I think what we're trying to share this morning Nigel is that probably three things.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:41.340]   One we've been hit hard and fast here in some of our most important highest margin businesses
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:50.180]   be it aviation and services particularly gas power services, PDX in health care.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:56.180]   We think that that gets worse before it gets better particularly here in the second quarter
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:59.940]   with a full effect.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:04.020]   It's uncertain as to how things play out from here.
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:11.060]   We're going to acknowledge that uncertainty hence the pulling of the guide but we're not
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:13.760]   going to sit back and hope that it all passes.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.260]   We're not going to take the view that we've got a sharp debounce coming hence the two billion
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:23.860]   of cost actions we've talked about and the three billion of cash actions.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:30.740]   We're going to do everything we possibly can to control our destiny here without impairing
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:35.140]   the long-term value and the long-term trajectory of our company.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:38.080]   So we're telling you what we know today.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:44.700]   We wish we knew more but that is really the state of play right now and the approach the
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.580]   headset that we're taking to it.
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:47.580]   Okay.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:48.580]   I appreciate that Larry.
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:49.580]   Thanks.
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.420]   I thought one of the real highlights of the quarter was the underlying strengths of the health
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:59.620]   care margins, even ex biopharma especially given some of the headwinds you face in there.
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:03.260]   We're seeing strengths in small equipments and pressure and big iron.
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.500]   How does that mix look though?
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:10.300]   When you look at the mix on smaller patient monitoring equipment et cetera versus the big
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:18.060]   iron, how does that equipment mix play out to the margins?
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:28.980]   Well we certainly, I think the key thing to keep in mind Nigel is the big iron certainly
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:41.100]   got hit, the lower ticket, the lower price points be patient monitors, ventilators and
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:50.140]   the like certainly got quite a boost but it's a small part of the business.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:53.540]   So there was a little bit of mix there but not a lot.
[01:29:53.540 --> 01:30:00.140]   It was really more a function frankly of the team doing a nice job more broadly recognizing
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:09.240]   that absent biopharma we needed to tend to the core cost structure and all its form in
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.260]   the ACS business.
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:15.820]   We've been growing health care, biopharma leading the way, we've got some good margin
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:19.300]   support from that business the last several years.
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:25.780]   So now as we think about the $17 billion core the teams really I think put their sights the
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:31.220]   last couple of quarters on growing that business, growing it with a creative margin and it's
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:38.220]   really the cumulative effect that you see a bit here in the first quarter before we got
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:39.220]   hit.
[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:41.260]   They got hit a little bit later, not as much.
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:44.820]   You'll see more of that unfortunately here in the second quarter but I think you've got
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:51.340]   a team who thinks that like many other Medtech companies they can low to mid single digits
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:58.660]   over time and put more digital into the mix, better cost that should give us the opportunity
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:04.020]   to grow with a creative margins along the lines of what Kieran laid out in December.
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:09.500]   I have no less conviction about their ability to do that today than we did when we made that
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:15.240]   presentation, again mindful that we've got some gyrations here in the near term to deal
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.240]   with.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.240]   Right.
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.240]   Okay, thanks Larry.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.240]   Good luck.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.240]   Thanks Nigel.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.240]   Thanks Nigel.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:27.420]   We are at the bottom of the hour so Brandon we're at the bottom of the hour so we can just take
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:29.060]   one more question.
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:30.060]   Sure.
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:33.620]   From RBC Capital Markets we have Dean Dre please go ahead.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:34.620]   Thank you.
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:39.820]   Good morning everyone, wishing everyone good health and I had my welcome to Carolina.
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:41.300]   Thank you.
[01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:43.940]   Good morning Dean.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:44.940]   Good morning.
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:52.280]   Just two questions, both aviation, a lot of discussion about structural cost out and Larry
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:32:01.060]   be interested in how have you balanced the structural cost out in aviation with rifts and balancing
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:09.060]   the rifts and furloughs versus how you might be compromising the ability to bounce back when
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:10.820]   it does ramp back up.
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:15.340]   So that's the first question and then the second one, just to make sure I heard it correctly,
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:19.580]   did you quantify the leap cancellations in the quarter?
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.380]   I know there's delivery deferrals.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:28.180]   Our experience in 2008 was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations because
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:33.420]   customers would lose that nonrefundable deposit so what's the expectation here in terms of
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:34.420]   engine cancellations?
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:37.780]   That's it for me, thank you.
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:51.860]   Maybe I'll take the first part of that and perhaps Carolina can take the second.
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:59.500]   I think we are mindful that there will be a recovery and we want to be well positioned
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:06.340]   for it because it's going to be very good business for GE for four decades.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:16.260]   But I think we are really trying to again embrace our reality and take the cost actions
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:23.100]   in the aftermarket business and more broadly at aviation, mindful that we've got a period
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:30.340]   of time here of an unknown duration but it's not going to be measured in months where that
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:33.300]   business is going to be under considerable pressure.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:41.180]   So after a period of time is the aftermarket has grown as it has the last decade, this
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:46.860]   is going to give us an opportunity to rethink, to consolidate.
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:53.940]   All the while, mindful of our obligations to customers, the nature of how the footprint
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:58.160]   has changed, the changes that are probably still coming.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.660]   So there are a number of variables, it's very much a work in progress as well but I think
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:11.380]   we've got line of sight to build on some of the temporary action to take permanent action
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:19.720]   to make sure that we have a lean cost structure with adequate capacity to come out of the downturn
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:25.140]   here, well positioned to perform both for customers and for investors.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:29.900]   Thank you, we'll now turn it back to Steve Whitaker for closing remarks.
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:37.340]   Do you want me to answer the question on, yeah, second question?
[01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:38.340]   Go ahead Carolina.
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:39.340]   Yes, I will.
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.340]   Go ahead Carolina.
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:47.100]   Yeah, you were right because I actually mentioned back in my notes there that in our backlog
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:54.480]   which was flat sequentially and up 22% versus per year, that did include roughly 200 Group
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:00.060]   B unit order translations in the quarter.
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:05.140]   I would say the progress we've found are very small so far, but on top of that we also saw
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.140]   GCAS, right?
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:11.460]   So we have GCAS cancellation of 69 aircrafts in April, so that will be reflected in the
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:16.060]   second quarter evaluation backlog.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:21.060]   Great, thanks everybody.
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:27.740]   I know it's a long call and a busy day so if you need more just reach out to us and that's
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:33.280]   our luck.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.280]   Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.280]   This concludes today's conference.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.620]   Thank you for joining and you may now disconnect.

[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   In addition, in today's remarks, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You can find our reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   in our slide presentation and in our release, which are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I will also remind everyone that in both our earnings release and today's presentation,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   we have included both as reported financials and supplemental financial information to assist with analysis and comparatives.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   The as reported financials only include the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment results
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   from the closing date of the transaction on February 29, 2020,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and the supplemental financial information provides results as the transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2018
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   to provide a full quarter of comparable results.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Turning to slide 3, on today's call we will provide an update on the top priorities of the company in the current operating environment
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as review our first quarter total company and segment highlights.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We will conclude today's call with the Q&A session.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   At this time, I will now turn over to the Santerenal Chief Executive Officer.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Thanks Rick and good morning to everyone on the call.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I would like to kick off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by COVID-19
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and all the dedicated healthcare workers, service funders and volunteers who are on the front lines
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   all over the world battling this pandemic.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll Rand employees around the world.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The pictures on slide 4 are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   who have adapted to the realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Every day I hear of new examples of our businesses providing mission critical products to our customers
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   one thing I am sure about is that Ingersoll Rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and serving our customers at the center of everything we do
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Moving to slide 5, I would like to grant everyone on the critical priorities we are following during these challenging times.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   When we close the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   that within a matter of weeks we will be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruptions to our customers supply chain
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   and the day-to-day operations of the company.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us to plan, accelerate and adapt our actions
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers and the community.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain times.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And finally continuing to execute on the strategy of the company
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   The strength of Ingersoll Rand team aligned around these three priorities
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   will position the company to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more unified company.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine that we call IRX
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   are really at the heart of how we operate as a company especially in these unprecedented times.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   During the integration process we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   One that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   This purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams leave on a daily basis
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   and the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll Rand Execution Excellence Process.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll Rand.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Turning to slide seven I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis since it has been swift
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and focused around two major components.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   First is the health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And second business continuity not only within operations but across a larger supply chain.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Starting first with health and safety we activated our COVID-19 tax force in February
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   and had a full coordinated company approach in early March just weeks after the creation of the new company.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Our execution approach has served us very well as we are able to quickly implement enhanced site safety protocols
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And it is very encouraging that our quick actions have been successful
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   But it's more than just implementing safety protocols, it's also about supporting and engaging the employee base.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   As a result we have implemented a number of measures including a global outreach program to facilitate employee feedback.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Not only did our team volunteers take individual pay cuts, furloughs and forego vacation time this year,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   they have thoughtful in-depth suggestions, many of which were actively implementing today.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   From our business continuity perspective starting first with our operations as we previously communicated
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   we have seen plans largely in China, Italy and India impacted due to COVID-19.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   China was largely impacted in the months of January and February and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   as things are now largely back to normal.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Italy and India saw about a two month lag to China with operations being impacted in late March and into April.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And in this time our sites around the globe are 98% operational with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The supply chain has seen a similar trend as the impact in China is largely behind us
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   The Americas and India regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   In the past few weeks we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Much like our operations India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of May when governmental restrictions begin to ease.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   We are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Let me tell you about what we're doing here.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Starting with slide 8 through the use of IRX we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over $350 million
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   with increases across all major savings categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   As a reminder we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost energies
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   of approximately $250 million by the end of year 3 after closing.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energies
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and the associated stand up of the new company.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters the facing of synergy delivery
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   and that is exactly what we have done.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   We have dramatically increased the pace having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   with approximately $70 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The majority of these savings are coming from head count actions already taking in the past two months
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   In addition we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   with RFQs for nearly one third of our historical direct materials fan base already launched
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   In total we are now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   which is approximately three times higher than the original year 1 expectation of 10 to 15% realization.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   We are keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three year time frame
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   at this time to remain prudent on volume dependent synergies like procurement
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and I have to be given the current environment.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   This is not only the structural cost that we have taken out
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   with thoughtful short term cost reductions to protect margins.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So let's move to slide nine to talk about that.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   In Q1 despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   on a pro forma basis we were able to limit adjusted EBITA decrementals to less than 30%.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   With the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   we expect that these additional actions would yield $40 to $50 million of incremental cost savings
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   in the PNL this year with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   We will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   and if the man environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   While we are making some tough decisions to control cost
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   one area that we are not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Much like we did back in 2015 at Georgia Denver
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   and new product opportunities we are following the same playbook today.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   such as the Man Generation and our IoT platforms.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   This is all part of the strategy to play offense
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   now especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Moving to slide 10 let me talk about liquidity.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   At the time of the merger we took the opportunity to reprise our legacy debt
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   by placing the new $1.9 billion dollar term loan to close this transaction.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   All of our debt is a term loan B structure
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   with very attractive pricing as the U.S. components are LIBOR plus 175
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   and the Euro component is a Euro board plus 200.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The term loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   and there are no maturities until 2027.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   as we finish the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and over $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   As we look ahead we continue to see several opportunities to own the cash
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Opportunities exist across working capital and cash taxes
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   in the second half of the year as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   will expire by September of 2020.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   given the attractive rate and covenant environment.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Turning to slide 11 our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   as we're building the culture of Ingersoll Rand with our employees at the core.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and preserve liquidity and at the same time we will position the company
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   for future growth both organically and through opportunistic targeted Bolton M&A.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Our business operates in a very fragmented market
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and importantly our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   is taking shape as we launch several of our ESG oriented initiatives already.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Overall we have several value creation levers as we look ahead
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain macroeconomic landscape.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I will now turn it over to Emily to work you through the financials.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Emily?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Thanks Vicente.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   On slide 12 you will see the as reported financials for the company.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   As a reminder the reported financials include three months of legacy Gardner Denver
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and one month of the legacy Ingersoll Rand industrial segment in Q1 2020
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   As a result the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   other than to mention that the as reported net income in the quarter
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   includes $197 million of amortization, acquisition, restructuring and other adjustments
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Turning to slide 13, to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   as if it had happened as of January 1, 2018.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   From a total company perspective FX suggested revenue and orders declined 14%
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Regionally we saw notable declines in Asia Pacific
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   as well as sharp declines in the US and Europe towards the end of the quarter
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   most notably in the ITNS segment.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   This led book to bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   The company delivered 208 million of adjusted EBITDA at a decline of 24%
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   driven mostly by the volume declines in ITNS and the expected downturn in the HPF segment.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4% down 200 basis points from last year.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   However our proactive cost controls within the business limited decrementals to 29%.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   the legacy Gardner Denver business delivered 97 million
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately 100 million
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   The legacy IR businesses delivered 51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   as opposed to a combined 60 million for January and February.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Moving to slide 14, pre-cash flow for the quarter was 60 million dollars
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   on an as reported basis including 8 million dollars of CAPEX.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   The Q1 pre-cash flow includes 63 million dollars of outflows related to the transaction
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   comprised of 38 million of synergy delivery and standup related costs
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   and another 25 million of transaction fees.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   We also paid 38 million dollars of debt issuance costs in the quarter
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   bringing our total transaction related outflows in the quarter to 100 million dollars.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   From a leverage perspective we finished at 2.6 times
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and while we do expect to see some short term increase to leverage
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   we have shown the ability to delever historically.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   As you can see on the right side of the page we'll remain extremely disciplined
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   on cash and we expect our capital allocation priorities
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   to be very aligned with what you have seen historically.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Specifically internal reinvestments for growth,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   prudent debt pay down and opportunistic bulls on M&A.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   We have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segment.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Vicente?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Thanks Emily. Starting first with industrial technologies and services on slide 15
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   the IT&S segment's first quarter adjusted order intake was $889 million
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   down 9% versus per year excluding effects.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Adjusted revenue in the quarter was $796 million, down 17% excluding effects
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and leading to a book to bill ratio of 1.12 times.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   From a regional perspective Asian Pacific revenues were down in the mid 30s
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   with Europe down 15% and America's down 7% all excluding effects.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   We used this trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   meaning that the APAC declining Q1 is what we expect to see in America's enemy in the near term.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   but we're staying highly active with the man generation activities and pricing controls
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   but we continue to demonstrate disciplining price generating over 1% in the quarter.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   While these markets are more opaque than historically we're using our unique data acquisition strategy
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We break this out into two areas aftermarket and original equipment.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   For aftermarket and leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   that are connected to our remote monitoring systems.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   In America and Europe we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few weeks of March
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   of nearly 30% with some recovery in the past few weeks of April.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   We're now using these as a way to know where our service teams need to focus
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   which is approximately 50% of the compressor business today.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   For original equipment we're using the man generation leads.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   We said in the past that the man gen was a leading indicator of orders
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   With more than a thousand leads per week we have a lot of commercial insight in our system.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   What we saw in the later weeks of March was a drop of 30% versus what we saw earlier in the quarter
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   with similar trends in America and Europe.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   but still approximately 20 to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers and vacuums
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   with orders down in the mid to high single digits.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   We have spoken about third party industry reports in the past
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   According to a leading third party report the market in the U.S.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   was down mid-single digits in dollars in the first quarter.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Garnet Denver branded products were flat
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and Ingersoll brand branded product was down high single digits.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   But when you look into the details you see the power of the two companies.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Garnet Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   while Ingersoll brand took share on high horsepower compressors.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   as well as the direct and indirect channels that both companies have.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Power tools and Lyft which is part of this segment had a very tough quarter
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   with orders and revenue down both over 20%.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   that online retailers typically make in the first quarter
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   to support first half of the year revenue.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   However, this quarter, in addition to the slowdown of the market,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   many online retailers switch their focus to household essentials.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Moving to non-gap at Yotar Ibiza,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   ITNS delivered 135 million dollars in the quarter
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   which was down 25%.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Non-gap at Yotar Ibiza margin was 17%,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   which was down 150 business points from the prior year.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Other cost mitigation efforts helped limit decrementals to 25%
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   in a segment that typically has basic decrementals of 35% to 40%
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   before cost actions.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Moving to slide 16 to the precision and science technology segment,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   overall the segment had solid performance in this economic environment
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   as adjusted orders were 280 million up 2% XFX.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Adjust of revenue was 192 million down 9% XFX.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   On strong prior year comes up 12% XFX growth
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   and shipment delays due to COVID-19.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   In the first quarter we saw orders growth high single digits
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   in the legacy medical pump business.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   As we are leading key player in several applications
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   like oxygen concentrators, respirators and liquid handling.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   go into at the bottom of the page.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Our team have been working 24/7
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   providing modified solutions that can be used
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   down 2% XFX with the majority due to COVID lockdowns
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   in January and February in China and towards the end of the quarter in India.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   and orders activity across many of the product lines and regions
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   due to the niche applications in water and chemicals
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   in the more industrial and markets.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Moving to non-gap adjusted EBITDA
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   PNST delivered 53 million down in the quarter
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   which is down 6%.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Non-gap adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Up 120 basis points driven by strong cost controls
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   and productivity leading to incremental margins of only 15%.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Moving to slide 17 and the specialty vehicle technology segment
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   the priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   in a profitable manner.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   We see that this segment can expand margins
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   with the use of the same IRX tools we have used across other segments
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Adjusted orders were $230 million
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   and adjusted revenue was $185 million
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   up 8% and 7% respectively
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   with a boost to bill of 1.15.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Growth was driven by the strength in golf, connectivity
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and consumer products.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   The business saw strong double digit order momentum
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   early January and February but as the pandemic hit the U.S.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   we saw sharp decline in the second half of March.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   What there is a lot to be excited about
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   we are expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple reasons.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   First, last year was a tough comp
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   where some product was shifted to the second quarter of 2019.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And two, the business is not immune to this current environment
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   while April orders were down year over year
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   We feel this is driven by a couple factors.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   First, in the consumer product line
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   the team people took quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   widely used in the legacy industrial businesses
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And second, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   across all of our locations
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   we were able to remain open
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   while some of our competitors were closed.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Moving to non-gap adjusted EBITDA
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   specialty vehicles deliver $18 million in the quarter down 1%.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Non-gap adjusted EBITDA was 9.9%
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   which was down 80 basis points
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   due to strategic growth investments and product mix.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Moving to slide 18 and the high pressure solution segment
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   the business performed above our expectations
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   in a tough operating environment
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   with adjusted orders of $84 million
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   and adjusted revenues of $96 million
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   down 26% and 29% respectively.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   As expected the revenue base in the business
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   was nearly 90% after market
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   and the team executed very well commercially
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   with sequential adjusted orders up 6%
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and sequential adjusted revenues up 26%
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   We continue to see shared gain opportunities in after market
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   and specifically consumables where we saw orders
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   and revenue up double digit sequentially.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   This allowed us to deliver non-gap adjusted EBITDA
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   of $24 million on margins of 24.6%
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   which was down from last year level of 30.8%
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   but sequentially better by over 400 basis points.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   As we pivot to the second quarter
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and rest of the year, a key leading indicator for this business
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   has always been activity and intensity.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   We can measure that in multiple ways
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   but the simplest form is the number of fleets
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   operational in the market.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Here each frag fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   with each truck carrying one pump.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Each pump has a fluid end
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   and every fluid end utilizes consumables.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Well Q1 and 2020 on average we saw 318 active fleets.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   The exit rate in March was 240.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   where we believe 50 active fleets
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   due to the recent dynamics in the market
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   with the oversupply and lower pricing
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   for oil sinful impact on revenues within this segment.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Because of that we're taking very proactive stand
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   to drive the proper cost takeout
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   to still show reasonable profitability
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   in the quarters to come.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Moving to slide 19, we wanted to provide
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   a quick snapshot of the overall
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   the total company is down approximately 20% in orders
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   as the month began very slow
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   particularly in U.S. and European markets
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   by the order momentum throughout April
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   we expect total revenue to be low
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   in terms of orders both industrial technology
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   and services and specialty vehicle segments
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   were right in line with the total company average.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   While precision and science technology
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   is performing considerably better
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   with positive year over year orders performance
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   thus far as a result of continuous strength
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   in medical pumps
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and not surprisingly the high-priced solution segment
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   is down a-
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   as the market resets for what will likely be a prolonged downturn
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   that we expect will last for a number of quarters.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   As we look forward due to the uncertain environment
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   that we found ourselves in
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   we will not be providing Q2 or total year
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   to best manage our business
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   and ensure we're taking the right steps to manage
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   and the associated impact on cash flows.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Our current model shows that the business
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   will need on an animal basis
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   to be cash flow break even using fairly conservative assumptions
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   around working capital and capital
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   coupled with the cost of actions we have taken thus far.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   We feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   when compared to current order trends
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   and coupled with our current liquidity position.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Current is like 20 for some concluding remarks.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I want to say that what we manage through
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   what we will no doubt be a top second quarter
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   we feel that the fundamental investment thesis
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   in the company has not changed.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Ingersoll-Ran is a premier industrial company
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   of our transformation.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   We have multiple levers for accelerating biocreation
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   or being very focused on the current part of our liquidity
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   with opportunities to increase these by unlocking cash
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   as well as taking advantage
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   of the current rate environment.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   We will continue to drive the culture of execution
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and we continue to pay attention to the particularity
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   on the current conditions to be strategic
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   on both on acquisition.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   For this we will turn to the Q&A.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   At this time I would like to remind everyone
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   in order to ask a question.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Number one on your telephone keypad.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   If you would like to remove yourself from the queue
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   you may press the pound
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   yourself to one question and one...
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Your first question comes from Andy Kapilitz
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   from Citigroup.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Your line is open.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Good morning guys, how are you?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Good morning Andy, how are you?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Vicente, can you give us more color
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   into the April order decline
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   you're seeing in your largest segment in ITNS?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   First of all, how long do you think
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   the change in customer behavior
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   from that power tool business
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   now have smaller upstairs exposure in ITNS?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   So are there discernible differences
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   in the run rate of these businesses
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   given their more project
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   versus the industrial compressor business?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Yeah Andy, let me just give you a little bit of color.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   As you saw we said roughly April
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   total order is down 20%,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   both to bill greater than one.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   From a both to bill perspective
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   the industrial technology
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   and the precision and science
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   were greater than one
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and obviously leading the way.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   In terms of ITNS in particular
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   I will categorize it as
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   the short cycle was most impacted in the quarter
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   and continue to see
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   some relatively witness here moving forward.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   It's mostly correlated to
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   I guess maybe the PMI
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   from the down and the mainstream
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   which is what we consider to be
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   more on the long cycle
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I'll say comparatively a bit more stable
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   in the first quarter
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   and we continue to see
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   maybe some of that in the month of April.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Again typically we tend to get the orders
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   for that long cycle now
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   in the first half of the year
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   in order to get shipments
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   in the second half
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and from a PTO
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   from a power to perspective
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   yeah I mean rough quarter
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   in Q1
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   as I alluded I mean last year
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   they were seeing some fairly good growth momentum
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   from their expansion into
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   online retailers
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   and you saw that in the first quarter
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   many of these online retailers
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   they moved
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   to having other more household goods
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   or critical needs
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   to fight COVID 19
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and clearly this business
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   saw some of the impact.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I'll say April sale is relatively slow
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   so we haven't seen
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   the people with the momentum
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   of the powerful business.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   So that's helpful Vicente
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and I'm sure you expect us
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   to ask about decremental margin
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   in some way so let me just ask it like this
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   obviously good result in Q1
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   of close to 30
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   think about decrementals
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   with high pressure solutions
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   the order's down 80%
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   can you hold decrementals
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   there in the mid 40s at what point
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   the fixed cost become a problem
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   I know you talked about accelerated
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   the rest of the business
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   can the rest of the business
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   hold 30% decrementals
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   in the rest of the business.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Yeah so I'll say Andy
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   I mean that's kind of what we're targeting for
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   and I mean as you have seen
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   you know we have performed well
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   in the down cycles in the past
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   I think we have a good solid playbook
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   that we executed in the 1516
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   that included both not only
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   in the industrial downturn but also
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   an upstream downturn
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   you know basic decrementals
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   they tend to be around 40%
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   across the business with slightly higher
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   in businesses like
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   the high pressure as you mentioned
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   as well as the precision and signs
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   because of the nice
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   high growth margins that those businesses have
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and you know lower on the
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   specialty vehicles and
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   the industrial technologies they tend to play
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   in that kind of 40% range
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   you know you've seen
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   that we have taken very decisive actions
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   between synergies and the short term actions
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   to protect the margin
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   we saw as you mentioned
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   some very good first quarter results
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   for the total business under 30%
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and Q2 will clearly see a bit more pressure
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   from a top line perspective
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   but we will continue to manage the decrementals
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   with the target being closer to that
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   30%
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   of the EBITDA
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and you know when you think about the actions
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   we're clearly taking much more
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   aggressive actions on the high pressure
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   around cost actions
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   based on what we see here
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   with a lot of our data points
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   and the long duration of the downturn
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   that we expect that business to have
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   very helpful to send this stay well
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   thank you
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   your next question comes from
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Julie and Mitchell from Barclays
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   your line is open
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   hi good morning
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   morning maybe just a first question
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   on that point on decremental margins
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   so if you could help us understand
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   perhaps the phasing
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   of the cost synergies through the year
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   and also of that
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   40 to 50 million
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   of other cost out actions
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   and should those mean that
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   decremental margins narrow
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   or not necessarily
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   depending
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   on your mix
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   and some other things
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   maybe break it down
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   into the two buckets
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   the 40 to 50
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   that we spoke about
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   that are kind of more related to
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   discretionary or kind of volume related
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   those are largely second quarter
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   in the third quarter
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   you already say more
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   on the second quarter
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   from
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   the cost synergy perspective
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   million dollars
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   out of the 80 to 90
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   million dollars of in year
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   you know roughly
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   account and I'll say that is kind of consistent
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   third quarter and fourth quarter
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   while the other roughly
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   10 to 20 million dollars
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   that comes from procurement
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   really more weighted towards
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Q3 and Q4
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   and then maybe just
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   my second question for you
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   or for Emily around the free cash flow
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   you had a good performance
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   in Q1
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   just wondered
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   you had assumptions around
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   break even free cash
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   but assuming
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   play out
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   you know what kind of
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   sales are down
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   25% for the year
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   what's like the free cash flow
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   conversion should we expect
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   how do you see
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   working capital moving
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   you had I think in the free cash
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   63 million dollars
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   of transaction and separation
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   cash cost in Q1
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   what's the rough
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   assumption for the year
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   yeah we're very pleased
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   with the Q1 cash performance
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   as you saw there Julian
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   we've been managing cash
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   you know from
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   to put in good processes
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   and strong controls around it
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   given the current
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   crisis we
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   we expect cash
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   to still be
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   to move forward but certainly
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   longer cash cycle
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   as we move through
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   and we're really managing
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   you know
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   payments as
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   the collections we're receiving
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   to maintain our strong cash flow
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   and liquidity positions
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   you know what the future holds
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   a lot of that's
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   you know going to depend
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   on
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   for sure but we know
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   we'll maintain our cash position
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   and our liquidity
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   and how about the
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   costs any very rough
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I'd posed for the year
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   in light of that
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   63 million in Q1
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   will be some
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   incremental cash
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   I don't have
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   the figure
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   at my fingertips
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   at the moment Julian but I can
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   get back to you on that
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   your next question
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   comes from Michael
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   from Baird
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   morning everyone hope everyone's doing well
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   so could we just talk about
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   the synergy funnel you referenced
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   what are some of the incremental sources
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   you originally identified
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   maybe talk about the difference
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   you're seeing
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   longer term some of the revenue
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   synergy opportunities you're seeing
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   as you recall
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   we always said
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   that we were going for
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   you know we were
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   60 days into
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   the transaction we have
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   visibility as to what that funnel could
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   potentially be
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   roughly the hundred million dollars comes from
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   a combination of structural savings
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   rationalization kind of
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   nonmanufacturing
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   alluded to on the investors
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   we have now a pretty good database
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   of all the locations
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   across the world and that is giving us
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   not so much
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   the amount
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   coming year two, year three
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   but
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   more the other kind
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   of perspective
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   so
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   second part of the question
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   liquidity is in a strong
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   position
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   some of the one off things
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   operation
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   and some of the extra things I just referenced
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   what would it take
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   with the cash out flow
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   and then secondary
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   related to that
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   that we're going into
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   some sort of recession here who knows how long
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   the opportunity is going to accelerate
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   for you to play capital more
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   toward the M&A side of things
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   over the next couple years
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   are you positioned for that today
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   kind of thoughts and how you're thinking
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   similarly about that capital side
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   over the next six nine plus months
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   yeah, no, absolutely
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Mike, I think
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   clearly over the next couple years
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   continue to be
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   a really hard
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   of our strategy
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   we see it's a very unique environment right now
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   we still see at this point
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   in time some very good funnel
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   also very good funnel
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   around
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   industrial technologies
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   but there are really more
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   releditorious buttons
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   thank you
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   your next question
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   comes from Nigel Koh from Wolff Research
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   your line is open
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   good morning how are you guys
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   good evening
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   yeah, good thanks
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   industrial tech performance
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   so a little bit
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   performance
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   and it seems like most of that
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   came from the legacy IR
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   businesses
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   please maybe just
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   spell out in a bit more detail
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   how much of that can be explained by
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   the jokes of the industrial
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   of the IR
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   also what happens
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   with service during the quarter
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Nigel what happened to what
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   I would say this
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   yeah
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   I think
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   China was definitely impacted
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   largely in January
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   and February
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   the legacy IR business they have
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   a pretty sizable China
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   exposure
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   in terms of
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   the service
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   you know we saw
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   service better
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   typically we saw roughly
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   about two times from a percentage perspective
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   better performance than
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   the original equipment
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   and just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   particularly
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   ways of comparing some
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   of the industrial technologies
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   composed of multiple technologies
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   compressors backings and blowers
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   compressive business is clearly within
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   the
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   when we specifically compare
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   to some of the compared first couple
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   of data points that we look at
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   so the third party report
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   at the same time you know just
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   to give you further perspective
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   the legacy gardener Denver business
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   in Q1 orders were down
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   in the low single
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   so in the market and
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   you know since we
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   we didn't own the legacy IR
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   for the full quarter
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   we just tend to not comment on what we saw
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   specifically you know
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   February that they saw from an order perspective
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   but that hopefully gives you a good perspective
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   as to how even on the legacy
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   great thanks
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   business this doesn't become so small
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   not so much involvement
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   if it is down a percent in the quarter
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   that implies you know
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   is it possible to break
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   given you're
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   expecting this business to be
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   kind of like
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   longer
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   would you expect revenue to kind of like
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   just bounce along the truck here
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   for the next several quarters
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   any kind of that would be helpful
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   yeah and so for sure
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   you know that's what we're targeting to be
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   you know the great even even positive
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   I mean we're taking some pretty
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   pretty aggressive actions
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   100% after marketing consumables
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   so that kind of carries
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   a much better margin
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   profile too as well
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   and you know those factories that are kind of
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   not needed
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   based on volume I mean we're
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   basically keeping them close
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   or very very low
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   exposure so a good playbook on how
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   how to not
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   have gone extensive work
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   and you know I think we see
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   that we can definitely overcome
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   these kind of longer
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   our plan is that it's going to be
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   down for a while
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   and to the second question
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   I mean clearly it's a market
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   that as you saw we just invested
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   in new fluid and technology
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   and you know we can be ready for capturing
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   great thank you very much
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   our next question comes from Jeff Sprott
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   from vertical research partners
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   thank you good morning everyone
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   good morning Jeff
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   why don't we just come back to service for a moment
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   just a
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   interesting comment about
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   utilization down
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   30%
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   but how do we actually interpret
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   and apply that to a forward
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   sales are going to be down 30%
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   and the service I don't believe
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   well if you have enough
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   data historically
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   to kind of piece that together
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   what does that down 30% tell you
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   yeah Jeff great question
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   so in terms of historical data
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   we don't have a lot of historical because as you know
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   as you can imagine a lot of these
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   remote monitoring systems and connectivity
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   with the IoT platforms
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   that we both companies have now
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   is fairly new
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   but we have enough data to then break it down
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   by the specific
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   sub end market
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   the indication here is that it's telling us
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   are those markets that
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   we should continue to play
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   or double down from a service perspective
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   so it's helping us to redirect the teams
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   it's also helping us to really better
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   serve our customers
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   and making sure that we're still more resilient
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   from that perspective
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   in terms of being down 30%
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   I think we just see that as
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   a bit of indication as to what could happen here
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   but as you gave us a great correlation
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   we don't have a lot of historical data
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   to
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   so what we're doing is just thinking that
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   data point to
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   focusing them on those
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   areas, regions and markets
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   that we're still seeing some very
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   good utilization of the compressors
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   and any answers
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   you noted ITS obviously
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   includes more than compressors
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   are you suggesting that those other products
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   their areas outside of that
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   views and blowers were substantial
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   yeah so for sure
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   for sure the power tools
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   and the lifting business
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   was one that was worse than that
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   the power tools
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   they have two main programs
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   I mean it's that tool business
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   but also they have
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   a lifting business
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   that is more related to factory consumption
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   or factory rationalization
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   so I think
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   that was impacted more so
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   and then China as a region
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   was definitely heavily impacted
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   from the other product lines
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   in terms of the longer cycle
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   which these are kind of brands
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   like Nash, Garro, Liquor Green Ponds
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   and Liquor Green Vacuums
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   those are more longer cycle
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   and those were also more stable and resilient
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   right thank you
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   your next question
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   comes from David Rosso
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   from Evercore ISI
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   your line is open
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   good morning
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   my question is about
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   in the ITF's inventory
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   and the channel and you think about
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   some of the recent improvement you've seen
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   can you give us some sense
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   on
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   any sequential improvement
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   sort of a lead lag
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   and also the mix of your businesses
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   being short cycle versus long cycle
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   can you just give us some sense
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   of the inventory
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   in those channels
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   the lag you would need to see
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   or that you would experience
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   if say the PMI's got better for example
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   yeah David I think
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   when we look at the inventory
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   in those channels
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   there's just no idea
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   from a compressor perspective
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   which is obviously the one that has
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   the size of the distribution network
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   and it is also more
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   particularly towards the Garner Denver branded products
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   you know we don't tend to have
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   a lot of inventory because
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   these are particularly smaller
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   distributors more sub regional lines
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   more localized
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   they don't tend to put a lot of cash
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   upfront to have compressors
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   on the shelf so to speak
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   maybe on the smaller compressors they may
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   but not on the medium
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   to high level compressors
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   and the inventory will come in more
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   on consumables after market
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   really move fairly
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   well I mean they turn
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   fairly quickly
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   you've seen just how clear
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   is it a stabilization at a low level
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   after the initial shock
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   in ITS
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   or have you seen some little improvement
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   in order sequentially
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   and I'd be curious is that more short cycle
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   or long cycle
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   I know a great question here
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   as regards as the stabilization
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   and
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   initially and then obviously when you look
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   at it within the month I mean
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   at the month of April you know there's some
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   slight improvement on the second half
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   of April
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   but again was that more short cycle improvement
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   short cycle yeah
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   short cycle alright thank you very much
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   appreciate it
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   your next question comes from
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Josh Pokolinsky
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   his open
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   hi good morning all
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   morning Josh
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   so this afternoon I guess everyone
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   here on the call kind of same list of questions
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   so we covered a lot of ground already
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   but I guess just with some
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   of the commentary around
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   utilization
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   and with the comments you made around supply chain
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   and eruption how much
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   of the decline you're seeing
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   and yeah I guess this comment
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   is mostly an ITNS comment
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   is related to
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   customer shutdowns or supply chain
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   and eruption and in some form
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   like the lights come back
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   on and a certain amount of demand comes back
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   because I think to some of these points
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   on service or utilization
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   that maybe that's not
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   the steady state
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   state of the world there
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   yeah Josh I'll say more so
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   in China
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   if you want to think about it kind of that
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   disruption
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   completely
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   also in the first quarter maybe some disruption
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   from the perspective of
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   in Europe particularly in Italy
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   I mean we do have some
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   very good manufacturing business in Italy
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   although we stayed operationally
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   most of our suppliers have to shut down
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   I would say
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   that now
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   as kind of the comment that I made before
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   the lower demand level kind of getting more stabilized
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   but
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   you know still
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   not seeing that kind of recovery
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   and we're just kind of waiting to see
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   how the recovery will play out
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Okay and then switching over
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   to the synergy funnel
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   I mean it sounds like
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   the year three
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   pipeline of activity kind of has to stay there
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   as you have to act on other things first
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   since more manufacturing centric
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   fair to say that the incremental
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   step up in synergy
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   then into year two is
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   it's smaller I guess
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   is this more of a pull forward from year two
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   or are you kind of implicitly saying
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   hey we think there's more than 250 here
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   we're just you know we're working on this
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   as fast as we can and we'll update you as we know more
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   yeah I think that's exactly the case
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   we think we want to keep it at 250
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   just because we think it's prudent
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   and we think it's prudent because
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   we're I mean clearly focused
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   on a lot of the internal funnel and execution
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   you see
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   how we accelerate it and we execute it
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   I mean this is not just talking about
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   we execute it
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   but there's a component around procurement
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   and an I2V
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   savings innovative value
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   that is bold independent
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   and when we did the $250 million
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   cost synergy funnel it was based
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   on 2019 kind of runway level
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   so to speak of spend levels
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   so we just want to be prudent
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   from kind of going out there
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   and saying that the $250 will increase
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   once we're ready we'll definitely
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   when we see more stability
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   normalization in the markets
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   maybe we come back with that
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   but at this point in time we're accelerating
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   what we can control and we know that
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   we can control that structural head count out
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   and that's exactly what we executed
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   we know we can control a lot of the quick
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   gains in procurement because commodities are lower
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   and we are executing that and we know we can control
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   a lot of discretionary spend and that's exactly
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   what we also executed so we're very focused
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   on kind of going through the list of things
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   that we can really execute
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Great, appreciate the call
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Your next question comes from
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Nathan Jones from Steeple
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Your line is open
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Good morning everyone
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   Good morning
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   See
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   revenue down
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   8.6 XFX margins
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   up 120 basis points
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   so clearly some
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   very good control there
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   on what drove the very good
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   decrementals there
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   How do you say the decrementals going forward
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   and maybe any color you can give us
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   on what you think the long term margin
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   opportunities in that business
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Nathan this is
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   I'll say some very good
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   cost control but also some very good momentum
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   that we had also from the medical
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   business if you remember last year
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   when we talked about the medical business we were seeing
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   upwards of 200 basis points margin improvement
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   and the medical business finishing last year
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   at roughly
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   31% EBITDA margin so
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   again very good momentum from that business
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   and clearly as we saw
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   some suffering in the market the team continue
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   to execute those targets
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   that they needed to get done
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   I think
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   when you look at this business
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   that has some very nice gross margins
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   and
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   the decrementals, the phase decrementals
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   are typically 45 or so
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   pretty good job that the team did
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   here in order to get the decrementals
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   down to the 15%
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   and I'll say from a long term perspective
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   we'll definitely come back
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   with giving some kind of medium to long term
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   perspective I'll just do a quick comparison
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   and you can see that medical we were able
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   to
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   just a few years ago that medical business
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   was in the 25%, 26% EBITDA margin
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   and we finished
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   last year in the 31% EBITDA margin
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   and there's just a lot of good
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   commonalities between the medical
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   and the legacy PFS
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   and ARO business that are within this segment
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Okay maybe just
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   one on receivables
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   when you look through that
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   do you see any customer credit risk
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   any collection risk there
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   I guess it's particularly
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   an upstream comment
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   given the way that market
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   is going but anywhere else you see
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   any potential issues
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   in receivables how you're going about managing
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   customer credit those kinds of things
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   I'll say none necessarily Nathan
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   I think it's one that
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   we live by day by day
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   I mean clearly
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   on the high pressure solution
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   which is as you mentioned the most exposed
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   I mean customers are still paying
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   they take longer to pay but they still pay
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   they also realize that
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   from an upstream perspective
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   that our business is critical and essential
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   for when the market comes back up again
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   so we have been pretty strict
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   in many cases that
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   we need to see the payment
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   or we will stop shipment and then we
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   see to provide any type
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   of output
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   either now or later in the future
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   so I think we're
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   really executing a good label here
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   on collections with the teams
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   thank you
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   your next question comes from
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Nicole DeBlaze from Deutsche Bank
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   your line is open
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   yeah thanks good morning guys
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   morning Nicole
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   so a lot of this has been answered
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   we've covered a lot of ground so far
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   but I just wanted to ask one
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   into next year as we think
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   about approaching our recovery
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   we've got more structural cost savings
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   coming through presumably
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   you have temporary cost
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   probably coming back to the business
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   and then just kind of
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   dovetailing all of that with typical
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   incremental margins, I'm not sure
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   how best you can do this Vicente
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   but it would be really helpful to characterize
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   the way you see incrementals
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   coming out on the other side
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   of this downturn
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   I think
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   we typically see
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   what I call the base level
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   of incremental to be
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   for the total business
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   between 35% to 40%
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   again, when you look at
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   precision and science maybe higher than that
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   specialty vehicles
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   lower than that
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   with maybe industrial technologies about that level
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   definitely
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   we'll see a little bit of a headwind
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   as we see a lot
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   of these structural activities
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   that we're going to come through
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   we also see
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   a lot of tailwinds
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   I'm sorry, with the tailwinds
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   a lot of these structural costs come out
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   we see some of the headwinds
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   but as we
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   get closer to
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   coming out here to our budgets
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   and how we work with the teams
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   we'll definitely find ways on how we can
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   continue to get that
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   incremental margin
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   to be at a minimum of that
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   days or more
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   your next question
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   your line is open
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   sorry, your next question
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   is from Markus Nittenmeier
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   from UBS, your line is open
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   hi, good morning everybody
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   I'll just put one more on the
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   hi, good morning
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   on synergies, I do appreciate
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   that obviously procurement is
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   a volume dependent
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   but you flag here 10 to 20 million
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   savings realized in 2020
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   what do you currently
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   assume as sort of full run rate savings
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   out of that way is one of the spend
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   which I think is a third of your overall spend
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   and how should we think about more medium
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   terms for the other two thirds
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   if you assume that at some point
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   in a normalised period you're back to about
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   2019 levels, let's start here
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   yeah, I think if you think about it
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   coming into 2020
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   in this year
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   as you go into 2021
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   assuming maybe current volume levels
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   it will be 20 to 40 million
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   so that's maybe
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   at least what you can see here
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   coming from wave 1
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   on an annualised level at current volumes
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   and that is only covering
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   a portion of the total spend
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   with wave 2 and wave 3
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   coming up here in the second half of the year
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   is there sort of an estimate you can give us
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   what that would have been at 19 volume levels
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   that sort of 20 to 40
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   I mean it would definitely be
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   higher than that
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   I wouldn't
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   you know
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   I think at this point in time
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   you could say 40 to 50 could be
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   upwards of 60
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   and then
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   second question on capital allocation
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   you flagged in the slides
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   in those bolt downs in PST
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   it's obviously pretty fragment
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   market you probably have a share of
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   call it 15% in that space
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   how do you think about this
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   how does that segment look like in a few years
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   from an aftermarket perspective
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   I know it's a design win and replacement business
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   so the aftermarket dollars per share
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   it's relatively small compared
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   to your company average
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   but how do you think about this
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   it just struck me that it was flagged
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   specifically in the slides
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   I think this is a segment we like a lot
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   by the way that
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   these businesses are so
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   niche and very
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   solid market positions
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   and it has just a lot of
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   great descriptors
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   such as high gross margins
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   and very specialized
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   bumps that are
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   kind of really solidly mission critical
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   in the processes
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   where they apply
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   we continue to see
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   that there's a lot of potential
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   not only in organic but also organically
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   and we're doing a lot of work on that
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   whether you take technologies
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   like the ARO
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   and combine that with
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   either a Haskell branded product
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   or a Milton Roy product
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   and then you can actually create some uniqueness
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   in terms of applications
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   and then enter some new markets
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   and that's what a lot of the team are doing
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   is how do we
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   are being thoughtful and mindful
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   on some of those vertical markets
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   and kind of new niche adjacent
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   areas that we want to play in
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   and not only do that organically
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   but then see what other technologies
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   from a Bolton perspective we can acquire
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   so a lot of really great work
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   strategically going on on this segment
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   to really
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   picture these and how do we
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   kind of double it
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   Thanks a lot, good luck
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Your next question comes from John Walsh
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   from Credit Suisse
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Your line is open
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Hi
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   Good morning, sorry about that
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   had some technical difficulties earlier
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   I'm glad to hear everyone's doing well
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   Maybe just
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   one question here
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   you alluded on the call to share gains
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   on kind of both
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   the legacy GDI and IR
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   businesses
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   I wanted to know if you could put a little more color around
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   what's driving those
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   Is it something on the product
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   side? Is it some of the
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   market strategies you were doing
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   previously around
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   more niche markets like paper
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   and pulp
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   maybe some competitive pressures
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   from smaller guys
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   just any kind of color you could provide there
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   would be helpful
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   I'm not categorizing
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   what I said on the call is that it is on specific
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   horsepower
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   we saw that we liked
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   this is in the U.S. based on the third party
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   report
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   and we liked because it was very
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   complementary so if you look at the legacy GDI
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   we saw some share takes
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   in the low to medium horsepower
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   while we saw on the Ingersoll Run
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   some share take on the high
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   kind of larger horsepower compressors
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   I will categorize that as
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   Ingersoll Run has done a pretty good job on launching
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   some new technology on the larger horsepower
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   well as you know
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   from a Gardner Denver perspective we have been more
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   focused on the medium to small compressor
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   and I think
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   this is what I mentioned on the call
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   that this is a great hypothesis that we had
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   on this great merge
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   and combining the two companies because now
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   we have great new complementary
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   products and spectrum of technologies
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   that
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   a lot of these that I mentioned is on the
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   oil lubricated
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   which is very good solid kind of
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   core product line but as we spoke about
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   during the April call
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   now also the oil free
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   product line spectrum so
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   again it's new technology
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   new products and be able
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   to show that uniqueness
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   of differentiation on the products that the teams are launching
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   great appreciate taking
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   the question
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   there are no further questions at this time
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   I turn the call back over to the company
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   thank you I just want to close
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   out by saying thanks to everyone
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   for your interest in
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Ingersoll Rand I want to do another
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   shootout and thank you to our employees
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   that are always doing a lot of work
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   here to stay health
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   stay safe to safety
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   and at the same time
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   you know provide to our customers the mission critical
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   pros that are needed
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   in this kind of current market condition so
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   hopefully everyone stays safe
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   and healthy and we'll look forward to
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   talking to you over the next few weeks
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   thank you
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   ladies and gentlemen this concludes
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   today's conference call thank you for participating
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   you may now disconnect

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Constellion's second quarter
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.320]   2020 Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a lease and only mode. Later, we will

[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.260]   Thanks Ryan. Good morning, good afternoon everyone and thank you for your interest in Constellion.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.180]   Let's turn to slide 5. At Constellion, the health and safety of our employees is our
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.420]   first priority. We have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees in response
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.020]   to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have provided our personnel with personal protective equipment,
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.740]   increased cleaning and sanitation, allowed for and enforced social distancing and worked
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.460]   to raise awareness with our employees. I want to personally thank our employees for taking
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.540]   this seriously and following the precautions we have put into place. As of last Friday approximately
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.120]   one-half of one percent of our employees have tested positive for COVID-19 and all of them
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.940]   have recovered or are recovering. Needless to say, we must remain vigilant.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.340]   During the second quarter, our plans operated well despite the significant disruptions to
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.100]   customer demand from lockdowns in both Europe and the U.S. As I'm speaking, all our plans
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.020]   are running now and well. We are carefully monitoring COVID-19 hotspots both for the health
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.820]   of our employees and any potential impacts on supply chains. The demand for our products
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.060]   gradually increased during the course of the second quarter and this trend has continued
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.440]   into July. However, both levels of demand and visibility from our customers remain below
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.260]   historical levels. We took strong actions to combat the effects
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.300]   of the pandemic on our business. We aggressively reduced our costs, including flexing variable
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.860]   costs to match production levels, reducing fixed costs and lowering our targeted capital
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.360]   expenditures. Over 40 percent of our workforce were on subtype of partial unemployment or
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.000]   temporary lay of scheme during the quarter. Where appropriate, we have also implemented
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.840]   permanent headcount reduction. Our ability to flex costs was slightly better than the
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.580]   scenario we provided last quarter. This was a great achievement by the entire Considium
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.780]   Team and demonstrated our flexibility and resilience. Our liquidity at the end of the quarter was
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.780]   949 million euros, an increase of over 300 million euros compared to the end of the first quarter.
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.480]   We added an additional 50 million euros of liquidity in July through credit facilities
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.040]   supported by the German state, bringing our pro forma liquidity to approximately one billion
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.600]   euros. In June, we accessed the debt markets to refinance
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.560]   our 2021 bonds. This transaction removed our unlinear-term bond maturity at a very attractive
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:15.000]   coupon. In conclusion, with the significant actions we have taken, I am very confident
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.240]   in our ability to navigate through this crisis. On slide 6, you will see some of our highlights
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:31.040]   from the second quarter of 2020. Shipments were 310,000 metric tons, a decrease of 25%
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:39.340]   compared to the second quarter of 2019. Revenue decreased 33% to 1 billion euros. Of the roughly
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.360]   500 million euro decline in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year, two thirds
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.320]   was related to lower shipments and one third was related to lower metal prices. I remind
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   you that while our revenues are affected by changes in metal prices, we operate a pass-through
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:06.260]   business model to minimize metal risk. Net loss of 32 million euros compared to net income
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:14.920]   of 17 million euros in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA of 81 million euros decreased
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:22.360]   51% compared to the second quarter of 2019. With a strong focus on cost control, we are able
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.680]   to offset a significant part of the volume Edwin's to adjusted EBITDA across each of our business
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.560]   units. I am proud of what the team was able to achieve
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:39.320]   in a challenging environment. Costadium generated 228 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.940]   half, a decline of 24% compared to the first six months of last year. Our free cash flow
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:53.120]   was negative 33 million euros in the second quarter of 2020. This result would not have
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.680]   been possible without our strong actions to reduce costs and capital expenditures and
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.300]   cash expenditures of all sorts. Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was 54 million
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:12.600]   euros. Based on our current view of market conditions, we expect to generate positive free cash flow
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:19.080]   in 2020. I will now hand over to Peter to discuss our financial performance in more detail.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.080]   Peter. Thank you Jean-Marc and thank you everyone
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.560]   for joining the call today. Turning now to slide 8, you will find the change in adjusted
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.560]   EBITDA by segment for the second quarter and the first half of 2020 compared to the same
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.160]   periods of last year. For the second quarter of 2020, Costadium achieved 81 million euros
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:48.320]   of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease of 86 million euros or 51% year over year. Part adjusted
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:57.320]   EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased by 21 million euros or 27% compared to last year.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:05.560]   A&T adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased by 33 million euros or 51% compared to the
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:13.840]   second quarter of 2019. AS&I adjusted EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:21.200]   million euros compared to last year. Lastly, holdings in corporate costs of 7 million euros
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.040]   were 1 million euros higher than last year. In the first six months of 2020, Costadium
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:36.400]   achieved 228 million euros of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease of 74 million euros or 24% year
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:45.320]   over year. Part adjusted EBITDA of 124 million euros decreased by 14 million euros or 11%
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:53.920]   compared to last year. A&T adjusted EBITDA of 83 million euros decreased by 33 million
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:03.320]   euros or 28% compared to the first six months of 2019. AS&I adjusted EBITDA of 33 million
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:12.100]   euros decreased by 26 million euros or 44% compared to last year. Lastly, holdings in corporate
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:19.040]   costs of 12 million euros were 1 million euros higher than last year. We expect agency costs
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:26.540]   of approximately 20 million euros in 2020. Now, turn to slide 9 and let's focus on the
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:35.020]   part segment. Adjusted EBITDA of 58 million euros decreased 27% compared to the second
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:41.960]   quarter of last year. Volume was a headwind of 41 million euros in the quarter. Packaging
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:49.440]   shipments failed by 12% primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in March of our Nufruzach
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   plant in France due to COVID-19. Shipments to the North American canned cheap market increased
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:04.680]   slightly year over year. Automotive shipments declined 54% compared to last year as many
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:12.960]   of our automotive OEM customers curtailed production for April and most of May. Price and mix was
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:20.400]   a headwind of 2 million euros. Costs were a tailwind of 21 million euros due to strong
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:27.000]   broad based cost control with labor and maintenance as important contributors. Metal costs were
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.480]   neutral in the quarter as we faced difficult year over year comps, UBC supply chain challenges
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:42.760]   and lower metal prices. FX translation was a tailwind of 1 million euros. Now, turn to
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:49.920]   slide 10 and let's focus on the ANT segment. Adjusted EBITDA of 31 million euros decreased
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:58.840]   by 51% compared to last year. Volume was a headwind of 46 million euros on lower aerospace
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:08.200]   and TID shipments. Aerospace shipments fell 37% compared to last year as aerospace OEM and
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:16.920]   distributors began to reduce orders. TID shipments declined by 20% due to lower industrial activity
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:25.200]   in both Europe and the US. Price and mix was a 3 million euro headwind due to lower aerospace
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:33.840]   shipments. Costs were a tailwind of 15 million euros due to strong broad based cost control
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:41.820]   with labor, metal and maintenance as important contributors. Lastly, FX translation was a
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:49.160]   1 million euro tailwind in the quarter. Now, turn to slide 11 and let's focus on the AS&I
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:57.240]   segment. Adjusted EBITDA of negative 1 million euros decreased by 31 million euros compared
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:04.520]   to the second quarter of 2019. Volume was a 31 million euro headwind. Automotive shipments
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:11.040]   declined 52% compared to last year due to customer shutdowns for a significant portion
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:19.640]   of the quarter. Industry shipments declined 16% due to lower industrial activity in Europe.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:25.980]   Price and mix was a 9 million euro headwind partially due to price and mix as a consequence
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:34.440]   of weaker market conditions. Costs were a 9 million euro tailwind on strong cost control
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   with labor, energy and fixed cost as important contributors. Lastly, FX translation was a 1
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:49.240]   million euro headwind in the quarter. Now, turning to slide 12, I want to highlight our
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:54.720]   very strong cost performance during the second quarter. In the second quarter we managed
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:02.960]   to flex our cost by 83%. Cost flex represents the change of cost over the change of revenues
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:10.460]   for the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019. Effectively, for
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:17.120]   every dollar change in revenue, we were able to flex our cost by 83 cents. This compares
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:23.760]   favorably to the 75% variable cost estimate we provided last quarter. At the bottom of
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:30.440]   the page, you can see that each of our businesses demonstrated strong cost control. With PARP
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:40.040]   at 92% cost flex and ANT and ASNI at 75%. To put this in context, excluding metal and
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:47.080]   depreciation, we reduced costs by approximately 100 million euros compared to the second quarter
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:54.680]   of last year. These cost savings were driven by strong cost control across the businesses
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:01.960]   including labor, maintenance, professional fees, subcontractors and energy. I will note
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:08.480]   that our second quarter 2020 figures include approximately a 15 million euro benefit from
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:17.120]   European state employment aid related to COVID-19. I want to congratulate the team for the aggressive
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:24.320]   actions taken on cost. We will continue to maintain our strong focus on cost control, particularly
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:31.480]   given the uncertain demand environment. Now let's turn to slide 13 and discuss our balance
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:38.240]   sheet and liquidity position. At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was 4.4 times
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:44.440]   and our net debt was 2.2 billion euros, slightly lower than our net debt position at the end
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:52.400]   of 2019. We remain very committed to capital discipline. We reduced our 2020 CAPEX target
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:15:00.920]   to approximately 175 million euros, a 96 million euro reduction from 2019. Through the first
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:09.240]   half of 2020, we spent 32 million euros less in CAPEX than in the same period of last year.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.280]   Our free cash flow for the second quarter was negative 33 million euros. During the quarter
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:21.120]   as a consequence of lower activity, our factored receivables were lower than the levels that
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:28.180]   we have maintained in recent quarters and negatively impacted our free cash flow by 73 million
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:35.400]   euros. We would expect the reverse to occur as activity levels increase. Excluding the
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:41.920]   impact of factoring, the company actually generated positive free cash flow in the second quarter,
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:50.080]   which is a very impressive outcome in my view. Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.480]   was 54 million euros. As John Mark noted earlier, we expect to generate positive free cash flow
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:02.360]   in 2020 based on our current view of market conditions. Generating free cash flow is a
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:09.200]   firm priority and we remain committed to deleveraging. As you can see in our debt summary on the bottom
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:17.080]   left hand side of the page, we have no bond maturities until 2024. During the quarter,
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:26.960]   we refinanced the remaining 200 million of our 4 and 5/8 percent notes due 2021 with $325
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:36.280]   million of 5 and 5/8 percent notes due 2028. While we initially planned to repay the 21
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.440]   with free cash flow, we felt it was prudent to remove this near-term maturity given the
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:49.080]   favorable debt market conditions. Notably, this was the lowest coupon dollar bomb that
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.960]   Constellium has ever priced, a considerable achievement in the midst of a pandemic. As
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:00.640]   a result of our financing activities thus far in 2020, we now expect cash interest of
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:09.520]   150 to 160 million euros. Our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:16.360]   949 million euros at the end of the second quarter. As John Mark noted, we added 50 million
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:22.820]   euros to this balance in July and we remain very comfortable in our liquidity position.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:28.880]   I will now hand the call back to John Mark. Thank you Peter. Let's turn to slide 15. I
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.920]   want to highlight something that is core to our business, sustainability. In early July
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:41.600]   we published our 2019 Business and Sustainability Report, which you can find on our website.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:48.760]   I'd like to point out a few highlights from 2019. Safety is our first priority. Our target
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:56.600]   is to reduce our recordable case rates by 10 percent year after year. Between 2016 and 2019,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:03.800]   our recordable case rate decreased by 27 percent and we are trending very well this year. This
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:11.080]   means that more of our colleagues are returning home injury-free every day. We also improved
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:18.200]   our energy efficiency by 6.4 percent compared to a 2015 baseline. That is the equivalent
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:27.080]   of 100,000 metric tons of CO2 savings every year. Further, we introduced the 2025 target
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:34.560]   to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 25 percent against the 2015 baseline and
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:44.000]   we have a detailed plan to achieve this target. As many of you know recycling is a core competency
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.400]   at Constellium. Aluminum is infinitely recyclable, with 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:58.480]   still in use today. Muscle Sholes is one of the largest recyclers of aluminum cans globally,
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:06.720]   with the capacity to recycle over 20 billion cans every year. At Northprezac, we also recycle
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:13.480]   the equivalent of 12 billion beverage cans every year. As a company, Constellium recycled
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:21.800]   over 560,000 metric tons of externally sourced aluminum scrap in 2019.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.200]   I am also proud that third parties are recognizing Constellium for our sustainability achievements.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.960]   The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative or ASI is an industry led initiative to drive sustainability
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:43.800]   across the entire aluminum value chain from producers to customers. In 2019, we received
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:49.640]   ASI certifications for Zingen's casting and rolling operation and we began producing ASI
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:57.560]   certified coils for our customers from Zingen in 2020. We also received ASI certification
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:05.040]   of our Northprezac facility under provisional COVID conditions in 2020.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:11.080]   We achieved the EcoVadis Platinum rating, which is awarded to the top 1 percent of companies
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:20.120]   assessed worldwide and we received an ESG rating of AA from MSCI, placing us in the top 5 percent
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:27.520]   of our sector. Overall, we had a very successful year on our sustainability objectives in 2019
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:34.320]   and I look forward to continuing our progress on these very important initiatives.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.440]   Now let's turn to slide 16 and discuss our end markets. We believe our balanced portfolio
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.880]   of products across end markets, geographies and customers is a competitive advantage during
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.840]   challenging times like these. I'll start with the packaging market. Packaging is a core
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:59.240]   market for constellation and we presented 38 percent of our LTM revenue. We continue to
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:06.400]   see strong demand in North America and stable demand in Europe. Further evidence that this
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:13.320]   market is both recession resilient and secular growth. We believe the packaging market has
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:19.400]   long-term secular growth tailwinds driven by customer preference for aluminum cans. Our
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.720]   customers continue to invest in new can lines with several additional investments in North
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:32.080]   America just announced in the last week. These additional lines should drive incremental demand
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:39.640]   for canned sheets in the years to come. The consumer preference trend is only one of tailwinds
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:46.000]   for canned sheet. In Europe, the demand for canned sheet continues to grow based on substitution
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.440]   of aluminum for steel. In the US, we continue to expect the growth of auto body sheet demand
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.400]   to tighten supply to the packaging market over the medium to long-term.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:06.280]   Now let's move to automotive. Over the long-term automotive remains a secular growth market
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:13.360]   for aluminum. Customers continue to prefer larger vehicles with regulations aimed at
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:19.180]   increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. The automotive market will need to continue
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:25.200]   to lightweight. In addition, we expect hybrid and electric vehicles to continue to gain share
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:31.080]   of the fleet. These vehicles are aluminum intensive due to the importance of lightweighting to
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.760]   achieve their range objectives. Constellium is well positioned to realize the benefits
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:43.240]   of this secular shift to aluminum in automotive and the electrification of the fleet. Moving
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:49.560]   to more recent trends, automotive OEMs began curtailing production in March and largely
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:57.080]   resumed production in May. While demand from our customers increased significantly in June,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:03.240]   we have experienced uneven demand for our products as a result of supply chain challenges and
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:10.920]   COVID-19 hotspots. While we are optimistic about automotive demand in the back half of 2020,
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:17.080]   the demand for our products will be dependent on the level of production at the OEM.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:24.760]   Let's turn now to aerospace. Aerospace represented 15% of our LTM revenues. The near-term outlook
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:33.200]   for aerospace remains uncertain due to the effects from COVID-19 and the 737 Max. Aerospace
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:41.440]   OEMs have reduced build rates and it is unclear how long build rates will remain at these levels.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.880]   We expect aerospace shipments in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 will be lower than the
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:54.840]   level in the second quarter of 2020. In TID, we expect to continue to expand in each product
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.760]   in a diversified range of markets over the long term. In the near-term, the defense and rail
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:07.920]   markets remain strong but most industrial and transportation markets remain weak. These markets
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:14.160]   are dependent upon the health of the industrial economy in Europe and North America. It is unclear
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:21.200]   when and to what extent these markets were rebounded. In closing, I again want to thank
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:27.440]   the Constellium team for their tireless efforts during this trying time. We remain committed
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:34.280]   to operational execution, harvesting the benefits of our investments, discipline capital deployment,
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:42.560]   debt reduction and shareholder value creation. With that Joanna, we will now open the Q&A
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.520]   session. Thank you sir.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press part and the number
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:55.000]   one on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish yourself to remove
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:06.220]   yourself from the queue please press the pound key. Your first question comes from the line
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:28.360]   of Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank, your line is open. Chris if you are on mute please unmute.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:48.480]   The first thing I wanted to start with was just the utilisation rates and the comments
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:54.380]   from one queue. You sort of stepped through how you saw utilisation in each of the divisions
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:59.520]   for two queue and perhaps for three queue and four queue. I appreciate you do not have guidance
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.800]   but I wondered whether you could maybe conceptually talk through three queue versus four queue
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.120]   and just versus two queue or any comments you could make on the divisions as an update
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.520]   from last quarter. Thanks.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:17.360]   Sure Chris. I will start with the markets and then kind of translate into what it can mean
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:24.640]   for the divisions, for the business units. When you look at our second quarter of this year
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:33.160]   versus the second quarter of last year, you see packaging roughly 10% down, you see automotive
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   50% down, you see aerospace 40% down, roughly. The other markets and each market is about
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:47.320]   25% down. This is made of very different dynamics. In packaging what we are seeing now
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:54.600]   is 95% utilisation. There was a bit of a drop especially in April with all the lockdowns
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.800]   in Europe, reduction in canned consumption and all that but that has come back pretty strong
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:07.280]   and the US continues to be quite strong. We look at packaging again recession resilient
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.800]   secular growth and we are pretty confident for the second half of the year and we look
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:20.940]   at Q2 as being a normal quarter because of all that happened in April and a little bit
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.940]   in May.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:27.680]   If I look at automotive, it has really snapped back. I think when we talked on Q1 we are talking
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   of 20% utilisation as we were speaking and now we are at above 80%. If you do the average
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:40.140]   of 20 and 80 you get to 50 which is about what we experienced in the second half in terms
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:51.920]   of reduction in shipments. It seems like it can be stronger than 80% going forward. We
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.340]   certainly are running very well in July but we have seen that this restart has been with
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:04.920]   all kinds of fits and stops. You got hotspots, you got supply chain disruptions, you got difficulties
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.640]   in bringing products from Mexico, building trucks in Texas, it's challenging. You got
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:16.760]   all those operational issues that all of us in the supply chain have to deal with but clearly
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:25.400]   the demand seems to be well in excess of 80% of where we were last year. That's encouraging
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:31.480]   and hopefully COVID-19 doesn't throw too much of a wrench in that good trend.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:38.920]   If I look now at aerospace where we are running at around 60% in the quarter we expect more
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:45.260]   pain in the second half of the year and I think the reason for that is it's a long supply
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:54.600]   chain and the customers move a little bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their orders
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:03.140]   and that is creating a bit of a lag in terms of how much pain we take. We are in very detailed
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:08.400]   discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion to look at what the second half ought
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.440]   to look like and whilst contractually we could force some volumes on us, that's not our type,
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.920]   what they don't need, we don't want to force on them. What we're working through is taking
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.520]   more pain now in the second half so that in 2021 we start with a clean slate. We would expect
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:34.920]   some reduction in operating rates in aerospace in the second half of the year. If you translate
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:41.440]   all that into what it means for the different BU's, I would expect Spark packaging and automotive
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:49.200]   structure to be better. I would expect AS&I automotive structures essentially to be better
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:56.760]   in the second half and I would expect ENT to be more challenged in the second half.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.840]   Thanks so much and sorry.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.880]   Go ahead.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:10.160]   Just follow up on packaging specifically where the volumes are down at around about 10% I
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:15.560]   think year on year and you're saying muscle shoulders is doing well, it seems like the US
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:22.000]   is going well. I think Crown yesterday mentioned that Southern Europe was weak. Can you comment
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.040]   a little bit further about packaging in the EU region? Was it down in the quarter because
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   of demand or because you had facilities offline and maybe you could quantify some of the EU
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.040]   impacts?
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:42.000]   I think so. The reason I'm saying more than 90% or 95% whatever, not 100% is exactly because
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:51.320]   of some weakness in Europe. I think it's got to do with both the reduction in activity in
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:57.840]   Southern Europe. A lot of these countries have economies that are based on tourism and this
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:04.960]   is not the best year for tourism as we all know. We are seeing little clusters and hotspots
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:12.240]   so everybody is vigilant as it should be. That is weighing down a little bit on canned consumption
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:20.080]   in Europe.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:30.920]   I want to follow up on working capital specifically. I just wanted maybe Peter if you could talk
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:36.640]   through the two cue moving parts. Obviously you've stepped through those waterfall charts
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.920]   and you're getting cost at doing a great job on the cost side. I just wanted if you comment
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:48.020]   a little bit further on the second half of the year and what the opportunities are on working
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:53.720]   capital in terms of you saying positive for the full year, you've already obviously hit the
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:58.860]   positive number at the halfway point. Just wanted if you could talk through the moving parts
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:04.960]   of working capital. Sure, happy to do it. Just for context, on the second quarter as we said
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:11.600]   last quarter we would use working capital and we in fact burned 63 million of working
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:20.880]   capital in the NQ2 and for the first half we're positive 24. Based on where we sit today I
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:28.280]   think it's plausible to think that with auto ramping, with packaging continuing to ramp
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:35.560]   back up, that we could lose some ground in the back half of the year. Not a huge negative
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:41.720]   but we could see working capital being a use in the back half of the year. But Chris I would
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:52.660]   say that we remain confident in spite of that that we can achieve a free cash flow position.
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:33:01.200]   Thanks Fada. That's it for me. Thank you. Good. Your next question comes from the line
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:08.720]   of Josh Sullivan from the Benchmark company. Your line is open. Good morning. Good morning
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:15.640]   Josh. Just a question. How are you thinking any tariffs on Canadian aluminum? Have you
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.400]   increased any inventory expecting that or just what should we be thinking on that front
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:28.940]   if that comes to fruition? Yeah. Well, we believe it's misguided measure if it happens, right?
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:34.760]   We've lobbied against it in the past, we've got it removed, it may come back. We think it's
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:40.320]   misguided and it doesn't address the problem which is overcapacity from China from a non-market
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.560]   economy that doesn't play by the same rules as we do. Now that said, if it happens it's
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:54.000]   got a very limited impact on us. I remind you that we pass through the melt cost essentially
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   to most of our customers. There may be a little section of the business where we cannot reprice
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.320]   immediately when it happens. But on the other side we may gain a little bit more on scrap
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.300]   recycling as well so not much of an impact for us. The reason we're against it is much more
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.580]   a matter of principle because we believe in free and fair trade and really a problem for
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:27.200]   our finances or our economy outcome. Got it. And then just on the canned sheet front, can
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:34.120]   you remind us of when your larger contracts are up for renegotiation and then just comment
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:41.280]   around pricing strength? Yeah. So we don't go into the detail of exactly which contract
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:49.880]   material went but you know that we've got a few renewals coming in around the 22 horizon.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:57.080]   We are making good progress and I think the pricing environment is, I would describe it
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:03.720]   as a mildly positive in the US and mildly negative in Europe because of the specific situation
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:10.800]   now. I remind you that contractual negotiations take a lot of time here and whilst we, you
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.920]   know, I say it's mildly positive here and mildly negative there between now and whenever
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:23.880]   we actually ink a contract, things may change but I think it's a pretty benign environment.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:30.960]   And our product is in demand. I'll brag a little bit, our quality and our service is very much
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:38.160]   recognized. Mr. Schultz has done a terrific job over the past five years and he's a very
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:43.600]   strong player in the market now, very recognized, their quality is service-wise and the Foozak
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.520]   has always been so we have a strong position and I'm looking at the future with a great
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:59.460]   deal of confidence. Great. Thank you. Thanks for your next question comes from the line
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:05.560]   of David Dragliano from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:10.360]   my questions. First of all, I did have one question on the numbers for the second quarter,
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:15.700]   did you say there was a $15 million one-time benefit included in the $81 million adjusted
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:24.480]   EBITDA line? You talking about for the labor benefit? I thought it was a COVID-19 state
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   aid benefit. Is that included in... Yeah, that's included in adjusted EBITDA. But it's another
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:37.960]   one if it continues, those programs are what is referred to as a curbside or short time
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:46.440]   work and these programs continue through 2020 and in some cases in 2021. Okay. So we should
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.760]   assume about a $15 million quarterly benefit from those programs each quarter? Well, yeah.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.840]   No, because what will happen David is remember, so in the second quarter we had a lot of people
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.960]   on the sidelines, right? But as we ramp up, then we're going to have substantially less
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:08.680]   of that. So I think you should assume that in the businesses, so packaging for example
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:17.960]   where we had some benefit in Q2, we should have basically very limited if any benefit in Q3
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:23.800]   and automotive which has fade away and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   innovation rate there, but it'll be a much lower number. To give you an indication, we
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:37.520]   mentioned about people being unemployed during the quarter at the trough which is behind us,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:44.080]   we had 6,000 people under some kind of unemployment benefit or temporary layoff. Now we are at
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:52.320]   less than 2,000. So it closed dramatically. Yeah. And David, just to put it in perspective
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:59.480]   if you get to the fourth quarter the number might be something like 25% of that, right?
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:05.160]   Just based on the utilization rate, just rough number. Okay. That's actually helpful. Thank
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:13.520]   you. And then just in terms of the individual and market commentary, on the aerospace side
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:20.560]   obviously that's the or has been the highest margin business and just in terms of the outlet
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:29.040]   commentary, you framed obviously two segments up, one segment down, but the down segment is
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.240]   again the highest margin segment. I didn't really get a census to order of magnitude of the
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:38.280]   down number versus the up numbers. Can you just give us a census? You believe that aerospace
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:44.800]   will completely offset the recovery and auto and packaging in the second half or a bit
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   more order of magnitude on the decline in aerospace would be helpful.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:56.280]   So it's very difficult to tell David because we're as we speak in very active discussions
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.000]   with our customers and at the end of the day, it's so cool that we have to make a jointly
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   with them. As I mentioned, we've got contracts whereby we can force them to take some product
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.400]   which they will take and pay for all, but then they don't need it the following year, right?
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.920]   So they hold the, they hold the inventory they are holding the back. So we are looking collaboratively
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.760]   with them in terms of what is it exactly they need, which by the way, I don't think they fully
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:28.960]   know now and it's no criticism of them. I mean, it's very unusual times and once we know what
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:35.040]   they need and we look at what cuts do we take, then I could answer your question possibly
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:42.800]   at this stage I cannot. I would just say that there will be for sure more pain in auto structures
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.360]   and then the auto structures in aerospace, my apologies, aerospace. Now the other thing too
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:54.080]   is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period in the recent past, the
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:40:01.880]   second half is always weaker than the first half, right, in aerospace. So that's something
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:11.080]   to factor in as well. Okay, and just my last related question is, I think you mentioned
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:17.000]   I think average utilization rates for aerospace related demand in the second quarter was around
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:24.360]   60% for higher facilities, is that right? What is that number now? We're running still around
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:36.200]   that number but I would expect it to go down maybe to 50% that kind of range. Okay, all right,
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   that's helpful. Thanks very much. Okay, yeah, so it's important to say, we're not expecting
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:48.320]   it to go down to 30% right there, that's not on the horizon.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:57.120]   Speaker, your next question comes from the line of Kurt Woodward from Credit Squeeze. Your
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:02.720]   line is open. Yeah, hi, good morning. Thank you, sir.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:09.040]   Peter, first question on the hundred million Euro cost reductions, how much of that would
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.400]   you view as structural and then, you know, I guess just in general in terms of the amount
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.380]   of cost you think you could take out of the business this year on a permanent basis, can
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:30.360]   you give us an update on those efforts? So if we look at the biggest piece of that hundred
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:39.160]   million is related to labor, right? And that's probably, labor is probably half of that hundred
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:47.800]   million. So what we're doing now is we are really closely looking at the business and,
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.640]   you know, what it's likely to be like for the next couple years and then, you know, trying
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:59.880]   to size our labor forces according to that. So in that regard, I think we would expect
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:06.960]   that there's going to be some kind of permanent savings. But remember, as we kind of ramp up
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:14.400]   the operations, we do expect some of that cost is going to come back, right? So, you know,
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:22.080]   I'd say it's hard to give a really precise number on that, Kurt, it's a difficult one.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:31.000]   Okay. Kurt, if I may add, we have talked about Horizon 22, right? And one of the strategic
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.440]   initiatives was to look at how do we lean our organization without losing competencies,
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:45.280]   capabilities, but how do we lean and make the organization stronger? And I think what COVID-19
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:51.360]   is doing to us and I guess to many other companies out there is accelerate the number of initiatives
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:58.300]   that may have taken more time to be implemented. So along the lines that Peter was saying, I
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:03.980]   think we'll come out of this with some permanent cost reductions and as we ramp up, we will not
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:10.320]   ramp up and inject back 100 million of cost. How much, you know, we'll remain to be seen
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:16.120]   because we're really learning as we're doing and we're just in the middle of it now, but
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.680]   we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:26.120]   And there's certain categories like, for example, professional fees, subcontractors, where,
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.120]   you know, kind of as we work without these, because those are, you know, kind of big categories
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:37.960]   of reduction, I think we were able to kind of live without a lot of that going forward.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:43.520]   So, yeah, I think there's definitely a piece about that we can carry forward.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.560]   There's a certain example there are, not trivial there, it's like revealing, right? So we've
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   got a very strong, you know, R&D and technical support organization, which is, you know, people
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:01.680]   that are centrally located and go and help plants. And historically, a lot of the work
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   was done by people going to the location. Now, obviously, in the past three months, nobody
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:12.900]   has been able to travel anywhere. And a lot of that has been done through remote interaction,
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:19.960]   video conference, but even when you go to a plant and you look at, I got a problem and
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:26.640]   I need to improve the speed on this mill, we've had people, you know, interacting by the
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:35.840]   milk a bit on the face time and going into looking into the rolling mills by face time
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:41.640]   with a technical advisor on the other side of the planet and that works actually fine,
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:46.280]   which we wouldn't have thought it would be possible. So, in the future, what you're gaining here
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:52.620]   is, well, you're saving travel time, which is not very good for the aerospace business,
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:59.600]   but also, you're saying the cost, you're saying the time, which means that people can be on
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.000]   several interventions, whereas historically, within a week, you know, it takes a week to
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.040]   get to the plant where you get the job done. So I think we're going to discover a few new
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:15.800]   ways of doing business in our, you know, space that are going to be quite interesting in the
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:21.380]   future and I think it's going to help us inject more brain and talent remotely with
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.460]   more action.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:29.000]   Yeah, and Kurt, you know, as we go forward, we may be able to give you more color on this,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.480]   but, you know, hopefully, it comes across that we're really looking hard at taking structural
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:40.320]   costs out and in the short term, the objective is we want to be, you know, kind of free cash
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:47.540]   flow positive through this crisis and so that we don't take on any incremental debt, ideally,
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.520]   and in the longer term, we want to emerge with a, you know, kind of much stronger earnings
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:58.920]   power. So we're focused on exactly that and, you know, we'll have more to say as we progress.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:06.080]   Okay, now that's helpful. And then, you know, in terms of the free cash flow, you know,
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:12.080]   dynamics, you mentioned, I think it's $73 million impact from backfiring this quarter, otherwise
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.720]   you'd be pretty cash flow positive, which is pretty positive given your utilization rate
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:23.720]   and now you're talking about 95% utilization and packaging over 80% and auto, and it seems
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:31.240]   like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized. So, you know, 75% of your
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:38.640]   business is, could be close to 90% utilization in a couple months, I get that arrow is weaker,
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.920]   but it would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint, you know, unless working
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:49.600]   capital would be a major negative, you should be generating decent free cash in the back
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.680]   half of the year. Can you comment at all on free cash flow potential in the back half
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   of the year?
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:01.480]   Sure, thanks for the question. So we won't put a specific number on it, but we're confident
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:07.880]   that we will generate free cash flow for the full year. And, you know, the back half of
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:14.080]   the year, I think there's a very good chance that we can generate some free cash flow, but
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.640]   it depends a lot on what happens with trade working capital. As I said, we've got, you
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:23.560]   know, the ramp of these businesses. So we want to be a little cautious until we see the pace
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:31.280]   of the ramp and the consequences of the ramp. But again, for the full year, we remain confident
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.520]   that we can generate free cash flow.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:40.600]   Okay. And then just final question on arrow, John Mark, you had a comment on, I guess, working
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:49.400]   with the OEMs to create, you said a clean slate entering 2021. So, you know, is that statement
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   kind of reflecting the fact that the OEMs cut very quickly? And I assume there's sort of
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:59.320]   an excess inventory issue that they're dealing with or in general supply chain. And so, you
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:04.280]   know, hypothetically, your volumes would be below the actual bill to rate to help them
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:10.160]   clear inventory. So then when you get into 2021, you know, the supply chain is in a pretty good
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.960]   position and, you know, contractually you said you're not going to force it on them. But then,
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:22.440]   you know, if you're going to help them manage that, do you get anything in return, i.e., you
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:27.080]   know, price benefit or, you know, is this kind of everyone helping each other, just a little
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.760]   bit of an understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate comment?
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:38.200]   Well, yeah, no fair question. So I think I've commented in past on the fact that I thought
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:44.880]   that the shipments we're making into the OEM right into the supply chain were actually
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:50.040]   higher than what the bill rates were warranting at the time. And obviously the bill rates are
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:57.400]   going down very significantly down. So now, so the pain we're going to take in the second
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:08.360]   half, I think is not going to cure all the, you know, inventory buildup in the supply chain.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:15.680]   But I think what that does is it positions us for 2021 that doesn't show further deterioration.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:20.680]   That's what we're into, right? And we want to be in a place where what we supply is by
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:26.440]   and large consistent with what is being built, right? So that's what we're trying to do. Whether
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:32.440]   we get there fully, I don't know, but certainly we are aiming to be better in 2021 than what
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:43.080]   the sector, the nine months of post COVID will be in ANT. That's, that's one of the goals.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:50.680]   In terms of what we're getting from the OEMs, we've got very strong deep strategic relationships
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:56.360]   with them. I've commented also in the past from the fact that we're in it for the long
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.720]   haul. And I think it's evidenced by the tenure contract we signed with Airbus. I mean, tenure
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:08.560]   is a long duration, never happened before. And we did it because it was the right thing
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:14.680]   to do for both companies, for both businesses. And we didn't do it as a reaction to COVID
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:21.240]   or whatever, right? I mean, that was really the desire to cement the strategic alignment
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:26.280]   between the two companies. So we're looking past the current crisis. The current crisis,
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:32.400]   we've got to get all in the same boat or in the same aircraft and put us in the same place,
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:38.560]   work together to overcome the crisis. And we are not talking about, you know, if I do that,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:43.680]   you give me a bit more price or whatever. I think it's just a relationship where we want
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:48.760]   to be in the win-win partnership and we do some things that help them and they'll do some
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.840]   things that help us in the future, which I've already done in the past and that's already
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:51:02.820]   happened and that's continuing. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Your next question comes
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:07.920]   from the line of Matthew Fields from Bank of America. Your line is open.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:15.400]   Hey Peter, one on the markets and then one on the balance sheet, please. So, you know,
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:23.160]   saw that CAN volumes were down about 11 percent, but, you know, Norse reported CAN volumes
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:29.320]   up 11 percent. I think you guys face relatively the same markets in Europe. Can you sort of
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:35.040]   point to why maybe they're having more success on their CAN volumes? Was it enough for SOC
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:40.600]   being down issue or a market issue or what? Can you just explain that discrepancy for us,
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:46.620]   please? So, it's mainly, I believe, I mean, I cannot comment on their specific situation,
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:52.320]   but in our case, the main reason was that we had to take down Naples Act for a full week
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:58.640]   and then ramp it up gradually. I remind you that Naples Act was at the center of a hotspot
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:06.880]   of the first real hotspot in France and that was very terrible conditions for the second
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:12.160]   half of March. So, in March, we continued to ship out of Finnish goods, but then we had
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:19.320]   to replenish the Finnish goods and that really took down our shipments in the second quarter,
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:26.920]   but we're back to normal now. Okay, thanks. That's sort of what I expected. And on the
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:33.120]   balance sheet, it looks like you got a decent amount of funding from France and obviously
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:40.240]   Switzerland and Germany. You said it was partially guaranteed, but it's also secured. Can you
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:46.280]   just give us a better understanding of sort of what it's secured by? Is it inventory
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:51.640]   or is it sort of PPE? And then, to what extent is it guaranteed by the French government?
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:59.440]   Well, it depends on the facility, but the big one, the French one is secured on PPE and
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:06.000]   E. And in the case of the German ones, one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:14.320]   and the Swiss one is unsecured. And the guarantees, the way they work is they guarantee a certain
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:21.160]   percentage of the principal. So, it's a normal syndicate of banks with, in the case of France,
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:29.200]   I think the guarantee is for 70% of the, or sorry, 80% in the case of France, of the principal
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:38.600]   balance is guaranteed by the French state. In the case of Germany, I think it's 80% too.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:43.960]   So just for our purposes as credit analyst, 80% of that French loan is sort of non-recourse
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:54.680]   to you. Well, again, it is recourse to us. What I think the point is is that if you're
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:54:01.400]   a lender, so for example, if you're in the syndicates of banks and you are lending say
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:08.500]   50%, your responsibility is for 10, oh sorry, 50%, 50 million, your responsibility is for
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:16.760]   10 of that, right? So it's the banks that benefit from the guarantee, not the company.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:21.480]   Okay. So you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks?
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:27.120]   Yeah, absolutely. But one thing is that, yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:32.220]   The government isn't backstopping the loan for you, it's backstopping the loan for the
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:38.340]   banks. Exactly. Exactly. But one thing to kind of, I think is a really important point
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:48.020]   is, you know, our intent in putting this liquidity on the balance sheet was to remove any question
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:53.380]   about the fact that we have enough liquidity. As we said from the beginning and based on
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:59.180]   the performance in the second quarter, we do not anticipate using this. So the French facility
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:05.960]   we had to draw just by the terms of the agreement, but it just sits on our balance sheet as cash.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:11.100]   And the German facility that we've now signed up in July, you know, we don't expect to draw
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:18.740]   that. The delay draw term loan, we haven't drawn that and the Swiss facility, we don't
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:26.180]   have that drawn in most instances. And the way we benefit from the state guarantee
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.540]   is through a very cheap interest, right? Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.940]   Right? That's right. That's cheap money and that was important
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.360]   to us. We don't think we need the money so we're not going to pay a lot of interest for
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.340]   it. Yeah, exactly. That ended obviously with an inducement
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:48.940]   for the banks to lend, right? Now, fair enough. And I think the French facility
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:54.340]   is what, 2.5% effectively at this point? Yeah, yeah. That's the code.
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:58.820]   All right. So you don't really have an incentive to pay that off quickly, you know, given your
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:02.900]   bonds or kind of twice that, right? No, no, that's right.
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:10.860]   So remember, there are some limitations on the use of the capital, right? So for example,
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:17.060]   we can't use that capital to go and buy back bonds in the market. So it's really meant to
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:22.040]   be for, you know, kind of operating needs of the company. But yeah, you're right, we don't
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:30.680]   have a strong incentive to repay that. But what we will do is, you know, obviously there
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:36.200]   is some cost to it, right? So as we kind of emerge from the crisis and have a little more
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:43.280]   visibility, then we'll unwind those facilities. Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks for all the
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:48.340]   color and good luck in the back ask. Thank you.
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:54.240]   Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrock from Boise Bank. Your line is open.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:00.540]   Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions and a really great job on transparency and costs
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.460]   here, both very helpful. Thanks Sean.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:09.140]   Just, when you think about big picture, if you look at the auto market, there's sort of projections
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:15.680]   out in the market that we'll have about, you know, 25% decline in new cars this year, mostly
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:20.340]   based on the fact that we weren't producing back in March/April. If you look at the used
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:26.260]   auto market, you know, it's been pretty strong as we've used prices really, you know, rising
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:31.980]   even above last year. You know, you talk about how production's been increasing and demand
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:38.720]   is increasing there. You know, to kind of get to down 25%, you know, you'd have to have
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:44.980]   some pretty strong growth in 3Q and 3/4. So I guess what I'm asking is, do you see that
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:50.540]   market as potentially inflecting soon, you know, with demand pulling through based on
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:53.620]   a lack of cars? And if you can provide a little color what you're seeing there, that'd be
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:54.620]   very helpful.
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:58:03.860]   Yeah. So, I mean, the auto book is strong. There's no question. It's above the 80% that I'm mentioning,
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:11.940]   right? But we've been a little bit caught, you know, by customers just a few months ago
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:17.220]   telling us we need product tomorrow and then telling us the next day the plant is shut down,
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:24.100]   right? So, you know, we're very vigilant, right? So I hope, I think the end demand is there.
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:28.500]   I think that's true in the U.S., that's true in Europe, right? The governments have injected
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:34.900]   a lot of money in the hands of consumers, right, through the unemployment benefits of, you know,
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:42.180]   different shapes and forms that you see on both continents. And that is, you know, pretty
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:47.700]   good for end demand at the end of the day. So I hope it's going to be -- it's going to
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:53.180]   materialize into the older book we have is going to be actually real holders and shipments,
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:59:02.400]   in which case it should be better. But, you know, we've seen fits and stops. You see plants
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:08.980]   restarting and then shutting down because there's COVID infections or you see people having trouble
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:17.600]   staffing, you know, the full shift because there's too many cases in the hotspot. So it's still
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:24.340]   fragile. I mean, loops are quite good, but it's still fragile, right?
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:29.700]   Right. That's helpful. Thank you, John Margin. I guess that's a good lead into the next question.
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:36.380]   So when you think about your customers, you know, we've had some shutdowns. We've had
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:41.780]   things come back online. Do you feel that your customers and their CEOs are getting more confidence
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:47.340]   in their ability to stay online or getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:52.180]   up the curve there? Yeah, I would think so. I think all of us have
[00:59:52.180 --> 01:00:02.200]   made tremendous efforts to provide the proper environment for our employees. It's very interesting.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:07.080]   I was commenting on the, you know, half of the percent of our employees have been affected
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:17.460]   by COVID confirmed. We have had no new case, confirmed case in Europe since the middle
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:22.740]   of May. So I think this is saying something about the
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:29.680]   fact that when people take responsibility in their daily lives, right, because it goes beyond
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.980]   what they do within our factories or during the eight hours or 10 hours, whatever they
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:42.220]   work with us, you can have an impact. And I think, you know, if people wear masks when
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:50.260]   they interact with outside with people they come across, I think it makes a tremendous difference.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:58.740]   So I hope the reality will slowly or more than slowly settle in and good practices will get
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:04.540]   that virus away from us sooner rather than later.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:08.900]   And I think people are seeing the confidence building up. I mean, it's human nature. You
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:13.540]   need to be affected to take steps. And I think we're in the process where, in many places,
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:17.700]   people are still being affected before they take steps. But if you look at China, and China
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:23.700]   is, you know, going extremely strong, you know, it's a small operation for us, but we are above
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:31.700]   budget and above last year, right? You look at Europe, new cases are really on a downward
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:38.420]   trend even though there's some clusters here and there. And we'll see a stronger rebound.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:43.980]   And I hope this is coming to us in the U.S. or throughout the U.S.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:48.360]   That's great. It's good to hear John Mark and I hope everybody is safe and well over there.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.300]   Thank you very much and good luck.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.300]   Thank you.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.300]   Go ahead sir.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.300]   Go ahead, Joanna.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:03.820]   Yes sir, I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:08.580]   back to Mr. John Mark Germain, CEO of Constellium. Go ahead.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:15.040]   Thank you Joanna. So thanks everyone for participating in the call today. As you can see, we are very
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:22.860]   focused on facing the crisis, protecting cash flow and building a stronger constellium when
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:27.660]   things are behind us. Thank you very much and look forward to updating you on our progress
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:31.500]   in Q3. Take care. Stay well.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:36.500]   Thank you speakers, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.320]   all for joining. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Yes Dan, welcome to the next on our Media Group Second Quarter 2020 Results Call.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Today's call is being recorded.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Giossani and Best Relations.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Please go ahead sir.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Thank you Anna and welcome everyone.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I just want to read the Safe Harbor Language after which we'll get to the actual presentation.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   All statements and comments made by management during this conference call other than statements
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   of historical fact may be deemed forward looking statements for the purposes of the private
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   security's litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Next are cautions that these forward looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   that may cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward looking statements made during the call.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   For additional details on these risks or uncertainties, please see Nextar's annual report on Form 10(k)
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   for the year ended December 31st 2019 and Nextar subsequent filings with Securities and Exchange Commission.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Nextar undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   With that it's now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to your host, Nextar Chairman, President and CEO, Terry please go ahead.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Thank you Joseph and good morning everyone.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Thank you all for joining us to review Nextar's record second quarter results today.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   When we get started I want to acknowledge the Nextar nation team members for their frontline essential work
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   and tireless efforts to provide viewers and users with continuous access to local news and other services
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   despite the challenges presented by the pandemic and recent civil unrest.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   With our planning and preparation strong balance sheet and commitment to our markets and employees
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I'm proud to say that Nextar has kept our employee roster intact
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   and our record quarterly results again reflect our team's commitment to flexibility throughout this time.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   As always our Chief Financial Officer Tom Carter is on the call with me this morning.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Nextar's industry leading scale and diversification are solid executions such as our new business strategies
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and our rapid adoption of cost containment programs at the onset of the pandemic
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   resulted in record second quarter results with all of our cash flow metrics well above consensus expectations.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The 41% rise in second quarter net revenue reflects growth in total television advertising revenue
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   as we draw year over year increases in the same space and new television business
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and strong shares of political spending in our markets
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as the 71% year over year increase in distribution fee revenues.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   As such despite the economic pressures related to the pandemic
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Nextar's top line growth in operating and expense management disciplines resulted in a 38.7 increase in net income
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and record second quarter broadcast cash flow adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   with those net metrics growing 28%, 49% and 127% respectively on a year over year basis.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   As the world continues to address the health and economic challenges brought on by the pandemic
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   the strengths of our business model and enterprise wide focus on managing operations for free cash flow
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   enabled us to bring about 21% of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   In the year to date period Nextar has generated approximately $631 million of free cash flow
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   before one time transaction expenses.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   By way of comparison we generated a total of $521 million of free cash flow in all of 2019
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   so our growth momentum remains strong even before the upcoming benefit of political spending in the back half of the year.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Reflecting repurchases made in Q1 we have reduced our share count to approximately 45.5 million shares outstanding
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   so 2020 year to date free cash flow per share amounts to about $13.86 per share
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and we remain confident in our unique positioning in this environment to again generate significant free cash flow
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   in the current quarter and again in Q4 of this year.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Speaking of the full year 2020 it's important to remember that approximately 60% of our annual revenue
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   is expected to be derived from contractual distribution fee and political advertising revenue
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   which is not expected to be materially impacted by the pandemic.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Specifically Nextar has solid visibility in terms of our contractual distribution economics through December of 2022
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   as we completed doing multi-year retent submission consent agreements representing approximately 70% of our subscribers at year-end 2019
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   as well as new long-term network affiliation contracts with CBS, Fox and NBC.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   At the same time Nextar has a strong balance sheet including approximately $665 million in cash as of June 30
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   with an access to another $140 million under our Revolving Credit Facility.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   We continually successfully navigate through the evolving challenges presented by the pandemic
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   based on our core value of serving communities where we operate by delivering leading local news
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and other critical information and content to viewers whether on air or online.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   In this regard Nextar stations have produced 41 separate town hall meetings addressing state and regional responses to the virus.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Additionally Nextar has generated over 30 different programs related to recent civil unrest and race relations in our communities.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   With local news and information while it's never been more essential for Americans
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   the pandemic has changed consumers' media consumption habits in ways that showcase the inherent strength of local broadcast television,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   our content and Nextar's leading local brands.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   As the most powerful and trusted voice in the country more people are turning into their stations local newscast than ever before.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   According to Nielsen data even as states and localities began to reopen in the second quarter
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   local broadcast television evening news viewership among adults aged 18 to 34 remained impressively high
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   with year over year increases in average cumulative weekly impressions in April, May and June of 151%, 83% and 89% respectively.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Similarly on the digital front Nextar's web sites and mobile apps grew year over year page views by 250% to 1.1 billion in April
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   with total monthly users up 133% to 96 million.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   We continue to generate strong digital audiences throughout the quarter with weekday and weekend page view traffic across our local web sites
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   up 50 and 60% respectively during the months of June compared to the prior year.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Additionally in terms of unique users Nextar's digital properties ranked number one in the country in local news,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   number 12 in all of news and information and with the number 33 site overall domestically in June as measured by Comscore.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   As the nation's largest producer of local news programming Nextar's proprietary content provides essential news and information
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   to users and viewers that is unique and relevant to each of the local communities we serve across the United States.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Now more than ever viewers rely on television news to stay informed about everything from the latest pandemic developments
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   to the reopening of the economy to the upcoming election.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   With Nextar's market leading stations and sites deep local and national reach and local broadcast record of being the most influential
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   and effective medium for both brands and politicians we expect to see advertisers continuing to allocate increased spending
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   to our broadcasts and digital platforms as this rep resolves.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Turning back to some second quarter highlights total television advertising revenue increased 18.1%
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   to 319.8 million including political revenue of 21.6 million and core advertising revenue of 298.2 million.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   While local and national advertisers adapted their media plans during the second quarter we sought sequential month over month improvement
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   in our same station core advertising revenue performance from April to May from May to June and this trend continuing in July.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Notwithstanding market place challenges Nextar's local sales initiatives continue to generate healthy levels of new business
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   with second quarter new to television ad revenue rising on both a quarterly sequential and year over year basis.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   In total our sales team generated 20.7 million dollars of second quarter new to television revenue
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   marking 11.3% rise over the first quarter and a 4.5% rise over the comparable 2019 period.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   As I mentioned at the outset of our call our new business strategies, ongoing sales training,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   education and deployment of performance focused initiatives combined with our sharing of best practices
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   have proven very effective in our ability to capture ad spend and share in both broadcast and digital locally.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   We recorded healthy levels of Q2 spending by political action committees and from candidates
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   with 2022nd quarter political revenue of 21.6 million exceeding our expectations from early in the quarter
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   despite the cancellation of some primaries.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Both presidential campaigns recently generated record levels of fundraising which bodes well for our upcoming political revenue trajectory
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   as such our full year 2020 expectation for net political revenue in the low 400 million range remains unchanged.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Recent distribution agreement renewals and the inclusion of WG in America resulted in a 71% rise
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   in second quarter distribution revenue to 536.5 million representing nearly 59% of total net revenue.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Second quarter 2020 total digital revenue declined by approximately 9.6 million dollars or 17%
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   reflecting our focus on higher margin profitable operations while digital profitability was up substantially over the comparable prior year period
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   as our website and mobile app engagement also rose significantly.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Total combined second quarter digital and distribution fee revenue of 583.2 million dollars rose approximately 57.1%
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   over the prior year period and rise 64% of quarterly revenues up from 57% in the year ago period.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   The year over year increase in second quarter distribution revenue reflects the new agreements reached in the second half of 2019
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   and our realization of trillion meter revenue synergies related to the after acquired clauses in our retransmission consent contracts
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   and as noted the inclusion of WG in America.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Our expectations for net retrans growth remain unchanged for the balance of the year in the mid teens percentage range
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   reflecting new long term network affiliation agreements with CVS Fox and NBC completed in the second half of 2019
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   and as a result over 80% of our big four affiliations are contracted through December 31 of 2021
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   and over 70% of our big four affiliations are contracted through December 31 of 2022.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   With our successful 2019 renewal of retransmission consent agreements representing approximately 70% of our subscriber base
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   with approximately 17% of the base to be renewed this year our significant net retrans revenue growth in 2020
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   will complement the strong political growth and spending that we're seeing taking together the affiliation renewals
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   which also include OTT agreements, our new retrans contracts and sub levels that remain in line with our forecast.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   We have pretty clear visibility for net retrans revenue growth expectations in 2020 and beyond.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   As we discussed on the last call at the onset of the pandemic we took immediate action to adapt our business
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   to address the economic impact on the US commercial advertising market.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   We implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   in excess of $40 million from budgeted second quarter levels.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Looking at the third quarter while the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   we're seeing the same pattern of month over month improvement in our pacing data
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   and expect to benefit from significantly increased levels of political ad spending
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and in fact our July political billing exceeded that of all of Q2.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Overall we're encouraged by continuing signs of recovery across our station footprint
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   and by key economic indicators including employment data and consumer spending
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and at present we're cautiously optimistic about the return of live sports
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   as live news and sports programming continues to generate the strongest levels of viewership across our all demographics.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Additionally preparations for the September 1 launch of WGN America's Primetime National Newcast News Nation
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   which will reach approximately 75 million households across the country
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   are proceeding on schedule and on budget.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   We're in rehearsals now and my first impressions of the product are very positive.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   NewsNational aired daily from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET and will draw on the local regional and national expertise
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   of NextGar's 5,400 journalists and 110 local newsrooms across the country
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   and during the quarter we announced the anchor teams and correspondents for our live
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   three-hour primetime national newscast were already attracting strong interest
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   from leading national advertisers at much higher than normal cost per points for WGN America.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Broadcasts will deliver news reporting that is fact-based, impactful and unbiased
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and we're confident that there are more Americans than ever before who are seeking just that.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   In addition to the live nightly newscast NewsNation's team of reporters and producers
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   will deliver news 24 hours a day online through NewsNation's soon-to-be-launched app NewsNation Now
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   which will create another opportunity for monetization and revenue diversification.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   As always we remain committed through generating free cash flow, actively managing our capital structure,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   our cost of capital and our liquidity position to provide the financial flexibility
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   to support our business and enhance shareholder returns as we emerge from the pandemic.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   During the first half of 2020 we allocated approximately 594 million in cash from operations
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and investments toward debt reduction, opportunistic share with purchases and cash dividends.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Additionally, as I mentioned before, NEXTA continues to maintain a strong balance sheet
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   including 665 million cash on hand at June 30 with access to additional 140 million
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   under our Revolving Credit Facility. On the return of capital front in late June
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   we declared our third quarterly cash dividend at the new 56th percent per share level
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   which was 24% ahead of last year's payout.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   With our 191% year-to-date free cash flow growth, our contractual distribution feed revenues,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   our food network distribution, our historically low LIBOR rates which have reduced our interest expense
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and what is projected to be the biggest presidential election cycle in the company's history,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   we remain confident in our positioning to be free cash flow positive in every quarter of 2020
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   and we continue to expect NEXTA's net leverage to decline to approximately four times by year end.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   In summary, while the pandemic has presented challenges for most every industry,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   NEXTA's leading local platforms are well positioned to continue building the top line,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Over time, our disciplines in these areas have strengthened the resiliency of our business
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   and our business model and created an unrivaled local marketing platform
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   while supporting increasing growing and growing returns for our shareholders.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   With that said, let me turn the call over to Tom Carter for our financial review and update. Tom?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Thanks Perry and good morning everybody. As outlined in this morning's press release,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   the actual results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 reflect the company's
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   legacy NEXTA operations and results from Tribune media stations which were acquired on September 19, 2019.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Second quarter 2020 revenue from WG and America also acquired in the Tribune transaction
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   is included in core television advertising revenue and distribution fee revenue.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Contribution from NEXTA's 31.3% ownership stake in television food network
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   and other investments acquired in the Tribune transaction is included in the full income
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   statement under income or loss on equity investments net
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   and in the cash flow statement under distributions from equity investments.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   The comparable three and six month period ended June 30, 2019 reflects legacy NEXTA operations
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   during that period. All actual results also reflect the impact of one time transaction expenses
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   incurred in the quarters both in the quarters and the six month period ending
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   With that, with a review of NEXTA's Q2 income statement and balance sheet data
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   after which I'll provide an update on our capital structure and some points of guidance.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   On a combined company basis and pro forma for the divested station,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   second quarter same station net total revenue was down 6% due to a decline in same station
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   core advertising revenue of approximately 35%.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Reflecting a sharp decline in April due to the pandemic
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   and subsequent month over month improvement from April to May from May to June.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Same station distribution fee revenue was up 28%
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   and continuing digital revenues were down 18.2%
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   reflecting local agency services revenue growth of approximately 8%
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   while station website revenue was down approximately 30%
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   due to software local customer buying trends related to the pandemic.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   To offset the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on commercial advertising revenue
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   late in the first quarter NEXTA implemented a range of cost cutting initiatives
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   in excess of $40 million from budgeted levels in the second quarter of 2020.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Second quarter station direct operating expenses net of trade expense
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   were approximately $414 million up from $292 million in the prior year
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   primarily reflecting the full quarter of incremental expenses associated with the
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Tribune operations and the budgeted growth in network affiliation expense
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   as a partial offset to our rising distribution revenue.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Second quarter station SG&A was approximately $158 million
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   inclusive of the Tribune operations.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Same station pro forma fixed expenses
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   excluding programming expenses were down 18%
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   over year over year period due to synergies related from the Tribune acquisition
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   and the previously mentioned expense reduction activities in response to the pandemic.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Corporate expenses were $35 million inclusive of $13 million of stock-based comp
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   and approximately $5.4 million of one-time transaction expenses
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   when excluding non-cash comp and one-time transaction expenses
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   recurring corporate expenses were approximately $17 million
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   which came in better than the guidance we had provided in the first quarter call
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   of approximately $21.5 million.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   By the end of April the vast majority of the initial operating synergies
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   of the Tribune transaction have been realized.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Second quarter operating cash taxes were approximately $6 million
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   substantially lower than our guidance of $45 to $50 million due to a timing difference.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   That $40 to $45 million variance will now be paid in Q3.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Ongoing CAPEX and transaction CAPEX total $40 million
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   spectrum repacked CAPEX total $13 million
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   and received approximately $26 million of reimbursement from the FCC during the quarter.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   As a reminder we anticipate being fully reimbursed
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   for all spectrum related CAPEX over the course of the year.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Second quarter total interest expense amounted to $82 million
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   up from $51 million in the same period in 2019
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   while cash interest expense was $78 million compared to $49 million last year
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   with increases due to obviously the increased debt associated with the Tribune funding
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   partially offset by lower interest rates.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Second quarter broadcast cash flow of $291 million
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   as well as adjusted EBICOT $298 million
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   and free cash flow of $200 million all pre-transaction expenses
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   exceeded consensus expectations
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   and primarily reflect the realization of synergies
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and growth related to the Tribune transaction.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Distribution free distribution agreement renewals
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   executed in the second half of the year
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   and the deferred cash taxes as I mentioned before.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Adjusted EBICOT and free cash flow reflect approximately $27 million
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   in distributions from equity investments
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   related to our 31% ownership in the TV Food Network.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   As a reminder we receive cash distributions from TV Food
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   on a quarterly basis with the largest payment recorded during the first quarter
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   of this year.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   For the third quarter of 2020 we anticipate recording approximately $12 million
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   in TV Food Network distributions.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   We expect cost savings in Q3 to approximate $25 million
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   relative to the originally budgeted levels
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   as variable cost and discretionary expenditures are prudently brought back online
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   with the expected strengthening of the economy
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and the broadcasting advertising environment.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   For the third quarter we project recurring cash corporate overhead
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   exclusive of SOC comp and transactions cost to be approximately $23 million
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   and we will easily meet our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   for approximately $120 million for the entire year.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Non-cash comp is projected to be approximately $13 million for the quarter
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   and $48 million for the full year.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Transaction expenses will approximate $3 million for the quarter
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   and will decline for the remainder part of the year.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Third quarter operating cash taxes are now estimated to be approximately $150 million
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and operating cash taxes for the entire year will now come in at approximately
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   $250 million in total.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Non-operating cash taxes associated with the gains on the asset sales
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   and legal settlements in Q3 will be approximately $83 million.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Third quarter cash tax should come in at approximately $40 million
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   and we're still expecting approximately $160 million for the entire year.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   We're proceeding on budget with our investment related to the launch
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   of WGN America's Primetime National Newscast News Nation on September 1
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   and prioritized capital expenditures to maintain maximum flexibility
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   in the current environment meaning the timing of certain cash tax can be delayed
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   until later quarters if required.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Finally we expect next star's cash interest expense to approximately $78 million
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   for the third quarter and $325 million to $350 million for the full year
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   reflecting interest expense savings related to the decline in LIBOR rates.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Turning to the balance sheet next star's outstanding debt at June 30
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   was approximately $8 billion and consisted of $5.4 billion of term loans
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   and two series of senior subordinated notes, one at approximately $900 million
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   and the other at $1.8 billion with maturities of 2024 and 2027 respectively.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Total net debt approximated $7.4 billion at June 30 compared to $7.6 billion
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   at March 31 and $8.3 billion at $1231, 2019.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Net debt for first lean covenant purposes is $5.2 billion
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   with net cash limited to a $200 million amount.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Our first lean covenant ratio at June 30 was approximately $3.11
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   compared to $3.52 at year end which is well below our first lean covenant
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   of four and a quarter.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   As a reminder our first lean covenant limits cash in adding to approximately $200 million.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Our total net leverage at quarter end was $4.47 compared to $5.18 at year end
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and as a reminder next star's only covenant is our first lean debt covenant
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   which is the aforementioned four and a quarter.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   At the onset of the pandemic next star took immediate actions
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   to adopt our business to the current environment and preserve liquidity
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   in order to best position the company for long term success
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   as we return to normalized operations.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   In this regard we continue to prioritize cash retention
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   and add approximately $231 million to our first quarter cash position
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   for a total cash balance of $665 million at June 30
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   with an additional $140 million available under our evolving credit facility.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   At the same time during the second quarter we returned approximately $25 million
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   to shareholders through the quarterly cash dividend
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   and made $13 million in payments on our debt.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   During the first half of 2020 we have accurately managed our capital structure
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   cost of capital and liquidity position to support our business
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   in this challenging environment while enhancing shareholder returns.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Year to date we have allocated approximately $594 million
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   towards shareholder value creating initiatives including $473 million
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   in debt reduction, $51 million in dividend payments
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and $73 million in share repurchase.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   In the near time while preliminary data suggests ongoing sequential improvement
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   in economic trends and the commercial advertising environment
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   we continue to focus on cash preservation in order to optimize our financial flexibility
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   as we move through the third quarter.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Looking ahead with continued double digit year over year growth
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and distribution revenue and what are expected to be robust spending levels
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   related to the upcoming presidential election
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   we have excellent visibility on over 50% of our annual revenue in 2020.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   As such we expect to be free cash flow positive in the third and fourth quarters
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   in addition to continuing our dividend payments we remain committed to allocating
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   the vast majority of our free cash flow towards leverage deduction
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   and confident in reaching our target level for the reduced level
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   of cognate leverage to four times by year end 2020.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Next star has already made significant progress in our leverage reduction plan
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   and we enjoy a strong cash position with additional capacity under our remover.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   In addition the reduction of interest rate expense related to favorable LIBOR rates
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   operating expense savings under capital allocation prioritization
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   will also serve us well in the second half of 2020.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   As a result we are confident in our liquidity position
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and ability to service our debt through these challenging times
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues as we move through the year.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   In summary despite the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   our scale leadership flexibility synergy realization
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   and operation plans are generating results.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Our capital structure is in great shape from a cost of capital maturity
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   and ability to quickly address leverage.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   In addition our service to our local communities
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and local and national advertisers has never been stronger.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   as well as consistency and visibility to our results
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   and we remain confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   in the near term and on the other side of the pandemic.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   That concludes the financial review for the call.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I'll now turn it over back to Perry for some closing remarks before Q&A.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Thanks very much Tom.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   In summary I hope that our comments today reinforce the fact
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   that we remain confident in the strength and the resilience
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   of next star's scaled and diversified business model.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Our next star's leading local platform is well positioned
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   to withstand this environment through the several factors
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   including our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   the continued growth of our distribution revenue stream
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   and what are projected to be record levels of political spending here in 2020.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   In terms of capital allocation we believe that our free cash flow
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   combined with the active management of both our cost structure
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   and our balance sheet will provide us with financial flexibility
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   to continue supporting our shareholder value creation initiatives.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   As a result next star is well positioned to fully participate
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   in the recovery and we remain highly confident in our core strategies
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   in terms of serving the communities where we have operations
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   and building the top line maintaining close control
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   This focus combined with our time proven operating strategies
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   is enabling next star to overcome the near term challenges
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and extend our long term record of growth and shareholder value creation.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   We look forward very much to catching up with you
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   with another positive report just after election day
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   and on behalf of the entire next star nation
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   our board and our management team thank you for your continued interest,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   support and for joining us today.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   So now let's open the call to Q&A to address your specific areas of interest.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Operator?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Yes sir thank you and if you would like to ask a question
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   please visit my pressing star one on your telephone keypad.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   If you are using a speakerphone please make sure your mute function has turned off
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   to allow your signal to reach our equipment.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Again that is star one if you would like to ask a question
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and we'll take our first question from John Janities with Wolff Research.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Thank you, Karia two for you.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   One is you talked about local news and viewership.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   What do you think in terms of advertised and demanded growth in news
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   relative to the day cards given the ratings you spoke to
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   and then I guess the sub levels in line with expectations
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   is the re-truth that there has been no noticeable impact
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   from the pandemic or is that just due to the call given the lack?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Well as it relates to local news you know through the first six months of this year
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   51% of our total advertising revenue came from local news
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and that's up over the prior years cumulative totals
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   indicates obviously advertisers you know are putting their money
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   into that product with increasing frequency.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Obviously the demand is where the audience is
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and that's where the audience is for us right now
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   and so we do see continued re-through
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and we're hopeful that the audience gains at least some of them will be sticky
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   when I hate to use this term when the new normal settles in as to whatever that is
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   so far through this normal people in all age groups
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   are tuning to our local news broadcasts in increasing numbers.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I will say that I mean obviously MBPD's have reported
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   sub-counts and attrition for the quarter you know those are
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   factored into our projections and analyses
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   and our re-trans revenue is again we forecast
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   attrition into our budgeting process and we are
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   we are at budget on re-trans revenue and our projections through the
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   end of this year so we have seen no significant decline
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   beyond what we had forecasted so we think it's business as usual
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   from a distribution revenue standpoint.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Thanks very much.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Our next question will come from Steven Cole with Wells Fargo.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Thanks wondering if you could talk a little bit about
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   your reverse compensation agreement as sub declines are accelerating
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   I was wondering if that's changing the tone of those at all and also does
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   it make you think about moving from like a per sub basis
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   sorry to a per sub basis from a fixed programming fee
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   where you can and relatedly we have more broadcast content
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   going direct to consumer like CBS All Access and Peacock so how do you think about
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   monetizing those households that may not be subscribing
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   through the traditional process?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Sure I would say the current relationships with the networks
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   are a mix of fixed fee and
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   percentages of distribution revenue so
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   there are some that are fungible and others that are not and those
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   conversations are continuing what's in the best interest of both parties to get a deal
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   done so there is some hedge there at this
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   point and we're not ready to call the ball as to what the most
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   preferable term is there based on our negotiating
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   ability. As it relates to CBS All Access
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   we participate in that we're paid to be a part of that service
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and our local stream is a part of that offering
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Peacock we are not affiliate local news
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   offering and we're not sure if at any point they will be
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   but we do have this thing called over the air which we reach
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   a much larger universe potentially than
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   the wired pay cable universe already where 16% of our
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   viewers already use that as their
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   reception device without the aid of a pay wall and that's available to
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   those who want to quote stream us that way if you will
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   and the good news about that is there are far few competitors
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   for eyeballs in an over the air world then there are
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   in a 500+ cable or satellite universe so
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   again we are in flux
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   we have a lot of our agreements nailed down through 21 and 22 we do have some
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   that will be up at the end of this year and early next year and that's where those
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   conversations will center around what's the best type of agreement
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   for both companies to enter into
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   great and I just went on political 4 years ago we kind of got a head fake at the last
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   minute from the Trump campaign in terms of not spending what was expected
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   I don't think any of us expect that to happen this time but when do you feel
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   comfortable that there's not going to be any negative surprises on the political
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   spending side well I'm pretty comfortable in that right now
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I mean look at the amount of money that both camps have raised that the
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   dependent PACs and special interest groups have raised supporting those
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   candidates as well as down valid candidates you know
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   there are no guarantees in this business but as close as a guarantee as I'll make you is there'll be no negative
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   surprise on political advertising that's a pretty good guarantee
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   thank you
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   we'll now take our next question from Zach Silver with B Riley
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   okay great thanks for getting the question the first one is just if you can quantify
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   the sequential improvement for core in July versus
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   total 2Q20 or even the pro forma year over year change so far in July
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and then more broadly and I think it's a little bit related to Steven's question
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   you know the narrative out there has been that the macro environment and growth and streaming
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   is going to accelerate the shift to add dollars from linear TV to
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   connected TV and streaming can you talk about how well positioned you are
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   to address that if that narrative does turn out to play out
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   I'll let you address how linear you want to get on guidance
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   obviously we saw substantial sequential improvement in core
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   ad trends in July versus not only June but the entire quarter
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Tom I don't know if you want to add any more details to that but
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I'll let you speak to that sure well I think
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   what I'll say about July is obviously July was substantially
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   better than the second quarter as a whole and July was
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   better than the last month of the second quarter so sequentially
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   things have gotten better and that trend continues into early Q3
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   as it relates to
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   additional streaming services
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   you know there at some point there becomes not kind of a
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   sameness to them and you know
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   it's all about the content if you have the content that people want
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   they will find a way to consume you whether that's over the air or whether
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   that's through a pay service or through a streaming service that we're paid to be on
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   and without our services you have an inferior offering
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   to the viewing public it is obviously demonstrated that local news
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   is a product that people want and are willing to pay for
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   and so I think we'll just stand by that you know it's a lot less
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   noisy at the operating level than it is perhaps at the investor level
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   about these streaming services you know is it a fragmenting universe
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   but are they just taking from a wire you know from a
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   traditional pay TV universe into a virtual pay TV
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   universe and if so and we're on both sides of that transaction
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   it's not you know it's not nearly the
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   noise that it appears to be in the investment community so we're
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   somewhat sanguine about it you know we have a product that people want
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   we're the largest producer of it in the country it's called local news and
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   we believe that product will stand the test of time as it has for the last
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   40 years test of time. Yeah I think that makes sense
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   and one more if I could does the
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   leverage ratio for this year contemplate any buybacks in the second half
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   and can you remind us of where we are in resuming the
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   repurchase program thanks.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   It does I won't say how much of it is allocated
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   to stock repurchases the way we think we
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   have an authorization left from the board we're
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   currently not buying stock but I would anticipate
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   that to get revisited here in the not too distant future
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   the way we think about it is really starting on
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Labor Day and quite honestly that's probably
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   not doing service to the fact that it's pretty mentioned July political
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   revenue is very strong and we think August will be as well we're rapidly
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   transitioning out of this being a story
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   during the pandemic just about
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   before advertising revenue and what's happening there. The other
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   two legs to the stool from our perspective
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   distribution revenue has been strong continues to be strong as Perry mentioned
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   we're on budget for the year we're on budget for the second we were
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   we're actually above budget for the second quarter we're on budget for the third
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   quarter with regard to retransmission revenues and then the third
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   leg of the stool is political and that's really going
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   to get lit here right around Labor Day and
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   run really hard for the two months of September
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   October and the first week of November so the free cash flow of the company
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   will continue to go along nicely
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   and then get turbocharged by free cash flow from political
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   beginning around Labor Day. As I've said to other people
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   I fully expect our capital
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   allocation attitude to change from playing defense to playing
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   offense sometime right around Labor Day we're not
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   there yet but I can see there from here and when
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   that happens then I would imagine we wouldn't sit here with an
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   unnatural $600 million of cash on our balance sheet we deploy
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   that by actually repaying debt and looking
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   at stock repurchases but that's a
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   multi-variable equation tell me what the stock is around that time
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   and I'll tell you what our appetite is. Is that responsive?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you both.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   I just want to add to Tom's comment about political.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Most folks woke up this morning reading about Biden's
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   buy that he's placing starting on September 1st
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   in 15 states we operate substantial
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   operations in 12 of those 15 states so just to point
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   out that political will reach a crescendo around Labor
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Day that will continue on through the first week of November
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   and again with July results being above all of second quarter
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   for political that's a pretty good measure I think
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   of what's yet to come and so we remain competent in our political guidance
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   and as that story continues to prove then I think you'll see
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Tom exercise more optionality around our cash
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   board that currently exists on the balance sheet.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Got it. Thanks Gary.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Well now I'll take our next question from Aaron Woff with Deutsche Bank.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Hi guys thanks for having me on.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   A couple questions on the ad environment I guess first
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   there's been some fits and start in terms of COVID cases
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   and pockets of the country what behavior
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   markets that have been affected by that and I guess
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   on a related note in terms of categories it's given the importance of the auto category
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   anything you can give us in terms of how
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   that rebound is shaping up and what you're expecting from auto
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   in the next couple months. Yeah auto
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   has rebounded you know we're seeing better pacing
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   results in Q3 than we did in Q2
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   when dealers were shut down we're seeing certain
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   of the OEMs move money around from market to market
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   based on where they have cars and that's primarily affected some of the foreign
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   name place but on the whole I think the
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   our expectations for auto are that it will be less down sequentially
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   going forward as will most of core advertising
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   as it related to COVID I didn't know if you meant
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   how it affected the company or what we're seeing in our markets
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   but I can give you a little color on both
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   we have had 145 confirmed
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   cases in the company since the beginning of the pandemic
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   remarkably out of a workforce of about
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   13,000 that you know that people that are out in the community
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   we've only had one hospitalization and that person is fully recovered
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   about 60% of our employees
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   are working from the facility to which they're assigned
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   we have another 20% that are reporting to work but not necessarily
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   in the facility reporters meeting their crews in the field to go to their
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   first assignment and things of that sort and we have another 20%
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   that are working remotely and
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   I use the example with our board that everybody in Topeka
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   is reporting to work however nobody is populating our New York offices because
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   of the public transportation requirements and they don't feel
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   safe and there's certainly no mandate to do that and so that's kind of a proxy for
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   the country we keep tabs by every market as to
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   various stages of reopening I would say that all of our markets
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   have some degree of reopening some more than others
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   there have been some pauses in California and Texas and others
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   on further reopening areas have been rolled back
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   and restaurants are not necessarily big advertising
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   categories with us to begin with hospitality continues
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   to be a category where we see no spend
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   to speak of there is some interstate
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   tourism ads that are going on like if you're in Texas come to Arkansas
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   and vice versa in Oklahoma we're seeing some of that
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   but hospitality for us is a sub 2% category that
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   is not materially driving our top line so
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Erin I don't know if that's the kind of flavor you're looking for but I'm happy
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   to answer any more specific follow up.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   One last one for me and I appreciate the time again
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   you spoke to the important local news and the ad
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   revenue that come in attached to that to the overall revenue pie
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   if we're thinking about the potential that maybe NFL football
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   delayed or college football doesn't happen in the fall how do we think
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   about the flow through of that potential and what it
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   could mean to your revenue pie. Sure I'm
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   glad you asked that it's interesting at the local station level which
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   is where we live all sports comprises about
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   10% of our advertising revenue and of that
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   the NFL comprises about 60% of that 10%
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   so let's just in real round numbers say that ad revenue
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   support is half of our revenue and NFL is 6%
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   of 10% of that so we're talking about 3 points of revenue
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   so from an advertising perspective
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   because of the limited avail that the local stations get in all of local
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   sports or all of televised sports that's not local
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   you know it's not that big of a contributor but
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   obviously it has an outsized effect on
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   viewership on promotional ability and I would say on the national psyche
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   and on people's morale obviously distributors are very interested
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   in live sports because they know live sports and live news
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   drive viewership but from a cure financial advertising point
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   of view it's not all that material to our top
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   or bottom line. Okay perfect that's exactly
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   what I was looking for. Stay well guys. Thank you.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Our next question will be from Brian Crouch with
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Deutsche Bank. Hi I have two questions
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   first I'm wondering if you could give us some
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   color on what you're seeing in terms of subscriber declines in your markets
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   curious how they compare to the overall industry
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   and any color on advertising and distributor reception
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   to NewsNation and any expectations for
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   when you might see some incremental revenue lift from NewsNation. Thanks.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Tom I'll let you read
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   the subscriber and then I'll talk about Tia and how's that?
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Sure I would say our
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   experience with subscribers is not materially different than that
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   of the MVPDs obviously
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   we are still getting an uplift from the virtual MVPD
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   so that the traditional MVPD subscriber loss
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   is somewhat recouped but certainly not all recouped
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   by the virtual MVPDs and as Perry
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   had mentioned obviously we factor in our budgeting
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   process and in our guidance process and attrition rate
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   for subscribers and a
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   unit rate for our revenue
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   and as we mentioned that was basically in line for the second
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   quarter and early returns for the third quarter are consistent
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   with that expectation so not getting into
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   specific subscriber decline numbers etc I would say
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   that we see and feel the same thing
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   that the
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   distributors do it's just that our
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   economics are a little bit different because we've got
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   rate that helps us offset that
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   but it's consistent with our expectations.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   As relates to WGN America we have had and Dana
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Zimmer and her team have been out presenting WGN America to every
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   MVPD which we already do business
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   and also those that do not carry WGN
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   WGN America and that's primarily in legacy next star markets
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   and we have an opportunity with renewals between now and the
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   end of the year for an incremental approximately 200 to 250,000
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   subs that could add WGN America and these are smaller
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   systems again where next star has a relationship but there was
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   no trivia relationship that would have included WGN America so
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   there is upside there and I would say that the reception
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   from distributors has been positive particularly from those who have
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   existing contracts and realize there's going to be additional value add
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   for no additional cost during the term of the current agreement.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   We are distributed on AT&T now
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   as the only virtual MVPD
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   service that is offering WGN America we are efforting
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   to get distribution at the launch
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   or shortly thereafter on other OTT services and that will be
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   value add where WGN America is not currently distributed but
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   the reception from both the advertising community and the distribution community has been
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   positive because we're investing in a product that will add value to their
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   businesses as well.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Great. Thanks for it.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   We'll take our next question from Dan Acredos with Benchmark.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Thanks. Good morning Slim Pickens left here
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   after the strong print and all the questions but I guess I'll ask you
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   one follow up to the prior Perry. I don't know if you're
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   willing to sort of, you know, good color on subcarriage
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   incremental opportunity. Is there any way for us to think about
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   sort of timing and how you're thinking about the news nation
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   impact itself relative to either advertising
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   or I guess ancillarily with that your comment
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   on carriage we know it's going to be self funding obviously you have plans to kind of
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   expand it so just any help kind of framing your thoughts
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity and then
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   separately, you know obviously there's been a lot of noise lately
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   in the digital world, Facebook, Twitter, Advoid products, all of that
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   fun stuff. You guys are the largest, you guys have a pretty big network effect
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   and a pretty strong digital portfolio yourselves. Is there any accrued benefit
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   to you guys or do you think that stays mostly in the digital bucket? Thanks.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   I'll speak first to WGN America.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   We have, I'm very impressed with the job
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   that Dave Rotem and the sales team have done in assembling
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   advertisers for the premiere, premiere week
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   of WGN America's news nation, blue chip names
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   and at cost per points that are
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   in excess of, I'm sorry I should say cost per thousands
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   that are in excess of 50% greater than what standard programming
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   was generating alone. So that's
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   a very positive initial indication. We're trying to rework some of the existing
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   buys into the news nation
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   prime time offering and so
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   what we could really use is an upfront or a fourth quarter scatter market
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   to break, but all of that said we do anticipate an incremental
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   let's call it low eight figure
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   revenue contribution to WGN's ad
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   revenue in the four months of the end of this year
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   and again given the size and scope of the operation
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   that wouldn't be deemed to be material but we do even in these conditions
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   expect a low eight figure uplift in gross
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   revenue there and distribution that will mostly
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   come at the end of the year so will impact 2021 more than
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   this year. There have been some incremental deals done already that
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   launched WGN America between now and the end
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   of the year but I would say the vast majority of that impact would be felt
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   in 2021 and again you're talking a potential
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   uplift of a quarter of a million subscribers on a
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Nielsen reported I think 75 million subscriber base so
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   even that is incremental but it's all incremental and that's what we're going to do
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   is drive incremental growth out of the assets that we own.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   And then the thoughts on either
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   Facebook, Twitter as it relates to core political if that stays in the digital
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   bucket or if you can pick some of that up.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Yeah listen I think the most direct transfer could be in political if people
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   certain platforms are refusing those ads that money has to go somewhere and
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   without conventions to fund and without rallies
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   to fund the one way to reach people is through broadcast
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   television I think we're seeing evidence of that right now so I think that would be
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   probably the direct transfer with all the boycats and all of that
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I don't think you've seen a substantial decline
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   in digital revenue performance on those platforms
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   so at this point the damage is more reputational
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   than financial and we'll see how deep
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   the government wants to get involved in taking a look and potentially
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   regulating these companies more symmetrically with the way we're
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   regulated but at this point I think the financial
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   transfer outside of political to the best of our knowledge is
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   minimal. Got it super helpful thanks for the coloring
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   next quarter. Thanks.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   Our next question will come from Greg Hubbard with Hubbard Research Partners.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   Yes good morning thank you
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   A few questions. Last quarter on your
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   conference call I believe you guys said your retrand subs were
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   down 4.5% year over year as you guys may
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   know Sinclair on the call right before yours said their second quarter
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   subs were down about 7% including the benefit from the
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   virtual side should I assume that you guys were down roughly about 7%
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   for the second quarter for your subs is that reasonable slightly worse than the first quarter
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   no
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   should I assume it's a little bit better than that then or can you just help me understand your
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   I would say it's more consistent with the second quarter
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   the second quarter I'm sorry you need more consistent with the first quarter
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   down 4.5% Oh I'm sorry with
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   what we announced the first quarter your first quarter
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   but no I wouldn't say it's down 4% correct I'm not going to give the exact
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   number I've already said that it's not down 7
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   but it's closer to the previous quarter's results
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   okay I appreciate that
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   can you help us your TV
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   advertising pacing for the month of August would you say that
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   those are tracking better the rate of decline there for core advertising for that is
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   tracking better than what you what July turned out to be
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   I think
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   it's a little we have very you know few days in August
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   here I'm thinking you know it's a little too early
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   to be making any comments with regard to that
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   okay can you help us and maybe just I'm trying to understand
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   then what you're sort of budgeting or thinking that the
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   rate of decline future for core advertising to be down in the third quarter
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   you can maybe help us
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   that's why we're not giving guidance right
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   it's going to be down with July how much July was down
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   if you would I think I told you it was down less
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   again I'm not going to give specific numbers
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   but July was down less than June and June was obviously
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   if it's just math if the entire quarter was down 35%
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   and every month within the second quarter got better
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   then clearly June was down less than 35%
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   and July was down less than June
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   that's kind of the extent of the forward looking guidance that we're
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   going to give as it relates to specific advertising revenue
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   okay
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   maybe let me ask another question and
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   in this virus situation that's going out there
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   in the states where the virus cases have gotten dramatically worse
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   here in the last several weeks have you guys seen a material change
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   in the core TV advertising in those markets
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   is there any significant change or you can talk about that
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   no and again
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   cases in Texas have gone down you know we don't
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   know just in one area that you're in that you might be hearing that news from
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   right so you've got to look across 114 markets
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   and look at those states and cases might
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   be reported to be up 30% which could be 100 cases in a
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   state I mean you've got to put all of these numbers into context but I would say
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   no the evidence is in our results in July
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   and our pacing in August and our pacing in September all substantially
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   better than where we exited second quarter and then we performed in second
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   quarter so you know the proof is in the numbers as Tom says it's just math but
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   we have not seen any and I think I just said this you know hospitality
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   continues to be down auto is improving we don't get a lot of money from
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   restaurants unless it's QSR and they're making mints through their drive through
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   so you know things are we're seeing steadily
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   improvements and even we're
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   pausing and opening is better than not being open at all and that's kind of our
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   worst case scenario in some of our markets and in others we don't have that
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   you know this morning we're dealing with the aftermath of storms up the east coast
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   from the Carolinas into Virginia and up into Pennsylvania and
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   New York and flooding and those kinds of things and those are going to be more
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   temporary disruptors to businesses until they can reopen then
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   the pandemic and so it's situational and we deal in 38 states
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   across the country and you've got to add it all together but there's you know
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   nothing other than business as usual is the way we deal with things and I think
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   the results speak for themselves and my last question
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   guys on the cost front you guys talked about pro forma cost in the second quarter down
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   18% can you give us a little bit more to how we should we
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   think about your cost trends for the third quarter I know you gave a figure
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   there versus your budget for the third quarter somewhere one for the second quarter
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   but just what sort of cost that you could help us a little bit think about that may
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   not repeat the cost savings in the third quarter you benefit from in the second
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   thank you I really don't understand the
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   question other than the fact obviously we had guided
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   to $40 million in cost takeouts in the second quarter
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   which we believe you know which we over performed on that same
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   number for the third quarter is 25 million as we
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   obviously some of those are variable costs as advertising starts to return
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   those costs go up some of them are discretionary
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   that we will add back in we will travel more in the third quarter than
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   we did in the second quarter we basically couldn't have traveled any less in the second quarter
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   than we did so some of the discretionary costs will get added back
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   in but that will be more than offset by
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   higher advertising revenues in the second quarter
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   but specifically as it relates to you know if you're looking
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   year over year the majority of the synergies
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   taken out of the Tribune transaction have occurred
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   so that won't change materially sequentially Q2
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Q3 over Q2 and you'll have some added expense
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   coming back in but that's the extent of some of the
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   the pushes and the pulls on expenses
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   well thank you appreciate that guys
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   we'll now take our next question from John
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   cornwrights with J.K. Media
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   I hope you can hear me having problems like a lot of people in the neighborhood
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   two quickies Tom
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   I think the 24 bonds were callable two days ago and I heard nothing
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   without it being that it's not likely to be called
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   well again John I think that's consistent with our message
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   that you know in the next 30 to 45 days
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   I think we will have a better
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   feel on actual political revenue coming in you know Labor Day
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   and obviously same with another month of core
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   and we'll be able to start making more
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   aggressive decisions with regard to capital allocation in the
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   obviously in the last 120 days and probably the next
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   30 days we're still going to continue to take a pretty conservative
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   view on that but hopefully be able to flip the switch and become
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   a little bit more aggressive in the near term
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   secondly did I hear correctly that
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   you're on track for mid teams next
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   retrans growth this year
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   you mentioned that the growth
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   is up high 20s
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   did I hear correctly growth up high 20s
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   mid teams
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   so far this year our
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   retrans revenue growth has exceeded 20% that is correct
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   we have budgeted for mid teams
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   in the second quarter I don't get what exactly the first quarter is
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   we budgeted for mid teams growth in
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   net retrans for the entire year but so far we have
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   exceeded that
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   more than a little bit this year
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   is that correct? No I would say that they're actually
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   up a little bit because we've included
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   a fair amount of Tribune subscribers that are non-Big 4 affiliates
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   where our net retrans margin
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   is substantially in excess of 50%
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Thank you very much
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   We'll now take our next question from Jim Goss with Barrington Research
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   Thanks
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   During the early days of the pandemic there seemed to be a surge
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   or a pretty good increase at least in usage
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   and even sampling of broadcast
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   and other video in categories that didn't take
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   or didn't tend to
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   If you would like to handle this request please press stop 0 again
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   Not sure what happened there
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   but I was wondering if any of that
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   has proven sustainable
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   If you would like to cancel this request please press
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   stop 0 again
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   I'm sorry I may have heard
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   Go ahead Jim I think somebody is trying to either record or exit
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   the call Okay sorry but anyway I was wondering if
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   any of the increased usage and sampling
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   has proven sustainable or has it mostly dissipated
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   and did any of that play a role in your retrans negotiations
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   during that period
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   We had precious few retrans negotiations
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   done in the first half of the year
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   we had one top ten that we're pleased with the results on
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   I would say in my comments earlier I did report
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   our viewership and I highlighted the 18-34
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   demographic you know obviously it was up in April 151%
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   83% in May and 89% in June
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   over the prior year our digital page views
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   which were in excess of 2.3 billion for the quarter were 1.1
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   billion in April that was up 133% and then in the month of
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   June just by comparison our local websites were up 60%
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   compared to the prior year so
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   there is some covid fatigue I think but I also think
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   there is increased interest in local news and we
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   with the diminuation of newspaper and radio local coverage
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   and content so we do think that there is
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   stickiness to this the long tail will determine how much
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   people continue to turn to our newscast and record numbers
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   and it's amazing you can see ATLA in Los Angeles
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   and WGN in Chicago independent stations by and large
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   but producing copious amounts of local news
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   are ranking number one in all day cards meeting all of the network O&Os
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   in virtually every newscast and it just speaks to the power of localism
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   that you're not dependent on network lead in or lead out to
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   generate your audience you're doing it on your own and we're particularly
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   gratified by that kind of execution producing those kinds of results
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   and one last thing
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   I was wondering about the promotion efforts
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   to create visibility for news nation as that
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   is coming to the fore and also it seems
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   like CNN tended to fill
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   a similar role to that which you're targeting
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   where they tend to be unbiased maybe it's a little less so
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   these days and if during that era
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   it would tend to be the place to go when something
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   an event occurred but it
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   some of the other news more pointed newscasts
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   politically would sort of gather their base
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   in more normal times so I'm wondering
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   if there's a way for you to position yourself to
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   sort of gather at least that role and maybe
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   have something more sustainable and if this proves successful
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   do you think you've broadened it beyond the three hour original timeframe
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   Well thanks Jim there's a lot in there to unpack I'll try and do my best
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   with it here obviously that is
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   how CNN started I don't think anyone listening to this call thinks CNN
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   is in that same place today from unbiased political lean
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   we as I've said before we have a staff of
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   rhetoricians and two full time staff that do nothing but check scripts and reporting
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   for unconscious bias and bias in our writing
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   and we've had very spirited discussions about that even in the rehearsals
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   you know we do think we will be that
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   place to go for news that doesn't make a 22 minute
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   news hole in a network evening news broadcast or much news
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   on the opinion based talk networks
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   for example last night in our rehearsals we did a story on the first women
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   police chief in Colorado Springs and that's not a story you'd see
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   every place else but again we've got our country divided up into six zones
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   and we have zone producers and their job is to know exactly what's going
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   on in those zones in all of those
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   newsrooms and what might be of interest to a national audience in addition to the 150
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   people we've hired in Chicago correspondents that are also based
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   in Miami New York Dallas Los Angeles and DC
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   that report exclusively for the network as well as all the behind
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   the scenes production folks that we think we can
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   give a more representative view of America than perhaps what's
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   seen inside the New York DC
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   Beltway so we think there's a purpose for that and there's a reason for that
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   and the acceptance of that concept now has been very enthusiastic
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   it's now just on us to deliver as it relates to promotion
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   we have secured something
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   that none of the other networks news networks I think are able
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   to compete with and that is to harness the power of 196
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   television stations across the next star nation to promote
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   this newscast on a day-to-day specific basis
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   beginning later this month and if you look at the
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   annualized promotion value that the stations will be contributing on a dedicated
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   basis it's something approaching $100 million
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   we are layering on top of that on an annualized basis approximately
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   $100 million of outside promotion expense
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   which primarily goes for advertising
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   on other cable networks because we're just a channel change away
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   at that point on national and syndicated radio
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   we're also investing heavily in social media not only because of the app
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   but to try and drive a younger demographic to an alternative newscast
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   and so we think our promotion spending
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   taken together a nine-figure amount of both cash and
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   in-kind contributions for the company are another asset
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   that will hopefully drive success for this effort
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   and again it is a counter-programming
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   opportunity in prime time and we're going to do our best to succeed there
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   obviously if we are successful we would look at other day parts
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   but we're taking very much of a crawl-walk-run approach to this
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   we want to get it right and we will grow as fast as our
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   success would allow us to grow so I think I'd leave it at that
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   but we're very excited about the prospect of
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   introducing an alternative in prime time to entertainment
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   sports and opinion programming and that the product
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   will reach a we'll strike a chord and
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   resonate with the audience and audience growth and advertiser growth will continue
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   so tune in, it launches on September
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   1st. Thanks for your care for a while
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   That does conclude our
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   question and answer session for today and I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sook
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   for any additional or closing remarks. Well thank you operator
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   again we're very pleased at our progress and we're pleased
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   at our strong financial position and we're excited about the launch of WGN
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   in America and the advent of the political spending season
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   that will all be upon us before our next call so we look forward reporting back to you
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   shortly after election day with the early results on
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   all of those efforts and thank you very much for your time this morning. Thanks for joining us.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   Once again that does conclude today's conference
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   we thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Aldeira's therapeutic
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.800]   second quarter 2020 financial results conference call.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.320]   At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.520]   After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.640]   To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.800]   If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.120]   Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.960]   If you require further assistance, please press star zero.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.400]   I would now like to introduce the company's chief financial officer, Mr. Josh Riedi.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.320]   Mr. Josh Riedi, thank you, you may begin.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   Thank you and good morning everyone.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.760]   On the call with me are Dr. Todd Brady, Aldeira's president and chief executive officer and David
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.360]   McMullen, our chief commercial officer.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.840]   Dr. Brady will begin with an overview of our recent highlights and upcoming clinical milestones.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.640]   I will discuss our second quarter financial results and then we'll take your questions.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.560]   Please note that this morning's conference call contains forward looking statements regarding
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.680]   future events and the future performance of Aldeira.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.800]   Forward looking statements include statements regarding the timing of planned clinical trial
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.380]   initiation, Aldeira's possible or assumed future results of operations, expenses and financial
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.360]   position, business strategies and plans, research development and commercial plans or expectations,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.780]   trends market sizing, competitive position, industry environment and potential growth
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.080]   opportunities among other things.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.920]   These statements are based upon the information available to the company today.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.400]   As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical site availability, staffing and patient recruitment
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.960]   have been negatively affected and the timelines to complete our clinical trials may be delayed.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.360]   Aldeira assumed no obligation to update these statements as circumstances change.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.420]   Future events and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the company's
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.080]   forward looking statements including the current and potential future impact of the COVID-19
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.800]   pandemic on our business results of operations and financial position.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.200]   No information concerning factors that could cause results differ materially from our forward
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.860]   looking statements are described in greater detail and the company's press release issues
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.340]   this morning containing financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.080]   company's filings with the SEC.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.760]   And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Todd Brady, our President and Chief Executive
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   Officer.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   Thank you Joshua and good morning everyone, as our industry and healthcare first responders
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.200]   continue working together to defeat the worst public health crisis in a century, our thoughts
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.240]   are with those affected by COVID-19.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.680]   The seemingly relentless spread of the novel coronavirus has made 2020 a tragic and surreal
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.200]   year but we remain hopeful and confident in the abilities of our industry to develop the
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.680]   therapies necessary to extinguish this virulent disease.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.720]   I again want to especially thank our team for their work and dedication to our mission developing
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.560]   first in class medicines to approve the lives of patients with immunological diseases
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   whose conditions are not being adequately treated by the current standard of care.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.640]   From our perspective, the key pipeline development to the second quarter was our Type C meeting
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.880]   with the FDA which charted the remaining clinical pathway to an NDA submission for topical ocular
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.600]   raproxilab in dry eye disease.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.000]   The meeting culminated in an agreement to use levels of reactive aldehyde species or rasp
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.600]   the therapeutic target for raproxilab as an objective sign in point for subsequent clinical
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.780]   evaluation.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.960]   In the fourth quarter of this year we plan to initiate clinical testing to assess the
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.040]   activity of topical ocular raproxilab in reducing tear levels of rasp and other objective signs
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.760]   of dry eye disease and we expect preliminary results by the end of the year.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.000]   The timing of the clinical trial is of course subject to finalization of trial designed
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.560]   rasp assay development and potential disruptions due to COVID-19.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.280]   Initiation of a safety study in dry eye disease patients is also planned for the fourth quarter
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.000]   and NDA submission is expected by the end of 2021.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.360]   Our optimism for the use of rasp as an objective sign of dry eye disease is supported by data
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.640]   from our successful phase 2A trial in which raproxilab treatment diminished levels of
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.040]   rasp and tears as measured by ELISA following 28 days of treatment.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.760]   For the upcoming rasp trials the longest duration dosing under consideration is also 28 days
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.200]   whereas the shortest dosing duration is 1 to 2 days.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.320]   Additionally the upcoming rasp trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:34.280]   effect of acute changes in dryness on rasp and other signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.240]   We'll be sharing additional details of the protocol following rasp assay validation
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.360]   and FDA requirement and look forward to providing trial designs shortly.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.840]   From a safety perspective top collocular raproxilab already has been evaluated in more than 1000
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.080]   patients with no observed safety concerns.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.840]   In short the safety consistency and clinically significant activity of raproxilab across
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.720]   numerous clinical trials suggests that raproxilab could be an important addition to the limited
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.120]   number of therapeutic options for dry eye disease which affects more than 30 million
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.280]   patients in the United States.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.760]   Looking at other ocular programs in our pipeline top line results from the phase 3 and Vigorate
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.600]   allergen chamber trial of raproxilab and allergic conjunctivitis are expected in the first half
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.480]   of 2021.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.800]   In the retinal disease area in the second quarter of this year the European Commission granted
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.840]   orphan medicinal product designation to ADX 2191 for the treatment of retinal detachment
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.480]   opening a new market opportunity for ADX 2191 and the European Union as drugs receiving
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.520]   the orphan medicinal product designation are eligible the protocol assistance, research
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.560]   funding and upon approval 10 years of EU market exclusivity.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:09.920]   ADX 2191 our novel and proprietary intravitrial methotrexate injection is being evaluated
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.160]   in the phase 3 guard trial for proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:21.000]   PVR is a rare but site threatening condition and the leading cause of failure of retinal
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.480]   detachment surgery affecting roughly 4,000 patients per year in the United States and nearly
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.720]   twice as many in Europe and Japan combined.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.700]   Given the nature of PVR and given the clinical site delays caused by COVID-19 the progress
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.440]   of guard has been slow although we expect to provide you with an update by the end of
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.440]   this year.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.640]   As many of you know there is no approved therapy for PVR and ADX 2191 has received orphan drug
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.040]   and fast-track designations from the FDA.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   ADX 2191 is also the subject of our new clinical program in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.840]   or PVRL a rare aggressive high-grade cancer that affects approximately 2,900 people in
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.720]   the United States with about 600 new cases diagnosed annually.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.440]   There are no approved treatments for the disease although the standard of care is pharmacy compounded
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.720]   methotrexate that has been injected into the eye.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:35.960]   We have recently filed for orphan drug designation for ADX 2191 in PVRL.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:42.320]   Turning to our systemic disease programs we are very excited about ADX 629 which to our
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.560]   knowledge is the first systemically available rasp inhibitor the clinical testing of which
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.960]   represents the first time systemic rasp inhibition has been assessed clinically marking an exciting
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.120]   new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism of action.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.960]   An IND has been filed with the FDA for phase two clinical testing of ADX 629 in patients
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:15.440]   with COVID-19 in order to prevent cytokine release syndrome and respiratory compromise.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.040]   Clinical development is expected to begin this year.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:26.720]   In an animal model of cytokine storm ADX 629 demonstrated a broad and highly statistically
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   significant reduction in cytokine levels including TNF alpha interferon gamma and IL 17 while
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.000]   up regulating the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL 10.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.320]   The data suggests that rasp inhibitors have the potential to represent immunological switches
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:53.880]   which may modulate immune systems from pro-inflammatory states to anti-inflammatory states.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:59.200]   In the fourth quarter of this year we also expect to initiate clinical trials of ADX 629
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:06.120]   in psoriasis and autoimmune disease and atopic asthma and allergic disease.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:13.040]   In combination trials in COVID-19 psoriasis and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.640]   and the results of the trials will characterize the immune modulating activity of ADX 629
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.960]   and rasp inhibition more generally.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:32.080]   According to ADX 1612 our novel HSP90 inhibitor enrollment has been completed in the investigator
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.960]   sponsored phase two Udario trial in ovarian cancer.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:45.580]   Regarding the ADX 1612 COVID-19 program consistent with FDA feedback additional preclinical antiviral
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:53.040]   testing of ADX 1612 against SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 will be performed
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.400]   by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases which has accepted our request to
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.760]   evaluate ADX 1612 and in vivo models.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:12.960]   We plan to update on the ADX 1612 COVID program by the end of 2020.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.160]   We approached the midpoint of the third quarter in a strong financial position enhancing our
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.360]   flexibility with recent common stock sales to two health care focused funds perceptive
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.600]   advisors and identity partners.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:35.400]   These transactions raised growth proceeds of approximately 19.5 million completing our previously
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.160]   announced at the market offering program.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:45.880]   We expect our cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations through 2022 including potential
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:53.000]   reproxelap approval in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.360]   Now with that I'd like to turn the call back over to Josh for the financial review.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:08.680]   Thanks Todd for the quarter ended June 30 2020 we reported a net loss of 7.5 million dollars
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:16.000]   compared with a net loss of 13.3 million dollars for the quarter ended June 30 2019.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.200]   Net loss per share with 25 cents for the quarter ended June 30 2020 compared with 49 cents
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.520]   for the same period in 2019.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.360]   Losses have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research and development programs
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.920]   as well as from general and administrative expenses.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.780]   Research and development expenses were 4.9 million dollars for the quarter ended June
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:45.100]   30 2020 compared with 10.7 million dollars for the same period in 2019.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:51.560]   The decrease of 5.8 million dollars is primarily related to a reduction in clinical and preclinical
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.600]   development manufacturing and personnel cost.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:02.200]   General administrative expenses were 2.2 million dollars for the quarter ended June 30 2020
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.700]   compared with 3.1 million dollars for the same period in 2019.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.680]   The decrease of 900 thousand dollars is due to lower personnel related costs including
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:17.440]   stock based compensation and other miscellaneous administrative costs.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.040]   In the second quarter of 2020 total operating expenses were 7.1 million dollars compared
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.440]   with total operating expenses of 13.7 million dollars for the same period in 2019.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:38.720]   As of June 30 2020 cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were 66.2 million dollars.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:46.820]   Subsequent to June 30 2020 25.2 million dollars in cash was received from at the market offering
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:54.140]   program sales to perceptive advisors, validity partners and other investors.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:14:00.960]   Increase on current operating plans, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30 2020
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:07.020]   plus the additional at the market offering program proceeds are expected to be sufficient
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:13.100]   to fund operations through the end of 2022 including potential NDA approvals for reproxel
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.980]   app and dry disease and allergic conjunctivitis assuming positive clinical trial results
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:24.100]   and planned NDA submissions, acceptances and approvals.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.900]   Increase of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are also expected to include the
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:35.180]   continuation of part one of the phase three guard trial in PVR and phase two clinical testing
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:42.100]   of ADX629 in orally administered rats inhibitor in inflammatory diseases.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:51.340]   Now turn the call back to Todd for closing comments.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:57.740]   Thanks Josh, we have a number of milestones planned for the second half of 2020 and look
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:04.500]   forward to executing on our clinical development strategy across our ocular and systemic programs.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.540]   Looking at our IR calendar next week we'll be presenting at the BTIG Virtual Biotechnology
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.660]   Conference and WEDBUSCH PACRO Virtual Healthcare Conference.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:21.920]   These events will be webcast please check the events and presentation section of our website
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   for details.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.180]   We always look forward to meeting with investors and hope to connect with you at these or other
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.100]   upcoming events.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.020]   As always we remain committed to executing efficiently on our strategic plan and bringing
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:40.740]   to market novel therapies that improve the lives of patients with serious unmet medical needs.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:46.020]   With that Josh Dave and I will be happy to take your questions operator.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.860]   At this time if you would like to ask a question please press star then be number one on your
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.740]   telephone keypad that is star one to ask a question.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:58.780]   Our first question comes from the line of Louie Sandwith-Hansler.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:04.020]   Hi thanks for taking my questions here so first question I have for you is could you get into
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:10.420]   more detail on significant the FDA's recognition of grafts as assigned for dry eye disease
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:15.340]   is and what that means for you in terms of potential approval and market opportunity.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.620]   And then the second question I have for you is on your COVID trials.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.700]   How adaptive are those trials in light of the constantly evolving landscape for the treatment
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.420]   of COVID and then how's enrollment gone and then my last question here is you noted that
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.560]   there's been some headwinds to clinical trial progression due to COVID can you give more
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.420]   color on which trials may be impacted here thank you.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.140]   Good morning Louise and thanks for your excellent questions.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:51.620]   The RASP development is truly transformative for Aldera RASP is the pharmaceutical target
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:56.120]   upon which the company was founded many years ago.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:05.460]   To our knowledge no company has ever therapeutically addressed RASP and yet RASP represents a very
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:11.620]   broad based anti-inflammatory approach that probably applies to many many diseases not
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:18.700]   only ocular diseases such as dry eye disease but also systemic diseases so for all those
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:26.220]   reasons we were thrilled about the FDA's decision to classify RASP as an objective sign of dry
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:32.060]   eye disease which as you know is an inflammatory condition.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:39.380]   What it means practically for the company is that the ongoing clinical trial the clinical
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:45.500]   trials that are about to start regarding the assessment of RASP should be likely to work
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:52.780]   based on the fact that the mechanism for proxylapin or other RASP inhibitors is the direct inhibition
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:18:00.100]   of RASP these compounds bind covalently to RASP so what we're really measuring is a chemical
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:07.900]   reaction in vivo and in this case in the tear fluid of patients that have been administered
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.260]   with proxylapin.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:16.260]   In all that leads us to believe that we'll be in a position to file an NDA for dry disease
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.660]   next year as we have previously announced.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:30.660]   Regarding the COVID trial design we anticipate for both programs enrolling approximately 30
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:36.460]   patients I think they'll likely be a two to one randomization drug to placebo.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:42.940]   At this point we have not included adaptive designs I think the nature of the results
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:48.900]   of these first trials will help us determine subsequent clinical testing which is obviously
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:55.500]   going to be much more significant if there are positive results from the preliminary
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.700]   outputs that we have here.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.100]   Enrollment hasn't started the IND has been filed for 629 and as I mentioned on the call
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:14.820]   today 1612 is the subject of further in vivo investigation in COVID that is being performed
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:26.660]   by NIAD and we're absolutely thrilled about NIAD's decision to test ADX 1612 on our behalf.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:34.060]   The COVID impact as you mentioned Louise across the industry has been significant the one trial
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:41.420]   in our case in our pipeline that has been affected by COVID-19 is the guard trial the
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.860]   phase 3 guard trial for PVR.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:53.900]   What seemed to have happened during the peak of COVID cases back in March April May and
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:00.900]   so forth was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite vision
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:11.380]   changes despite losing sight the number of patients coming in was diminished during
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:18.000]   that time frame and furthermore many clinical sites as you know simply did not have research
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.260]   staff which were considered for a while to be non essential such that it was a difficult
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:32.180]   if not impossible in some cases to enroll patients however the good news is regarding the rest
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:39.540]   of the pipeline we do not seem to have been overtly affected by COVID in terms of enrollment
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:48.140]   the dry eye program was largely under discussion with the FDA during the peak number of cases
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:56.180]   in the spring the allergy program the phase 3 allergy program was on a planned hold because
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:02.180]   of pollen as you know you cannot enroll allergy programs with ambient pollen and we expect
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:08.300]   the invigorate program to re initiate again in the fall so we were quite fortunate in terms
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:17.980]   of timing with regard to our other clinical programs we relative to the impact of COVID
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:24.380]   okay thank you as a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star then
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:29.820]   the number one on your telephone keypad that is star one to ask a question for next question
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:36.180]   comes from the line of Justin with Oppenheimer and company hi good morning guys thanks for
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.460]   taking the questions and congrats on the progress I know it's early days but you know as you
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.460]   think about establishing a process left action on rats as a sign of dry eye we've
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.260]   had some discussion with investors on what would be an appropriate duration of observation
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.000]   to assess this activity can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.660]   acute versus four week time points from a trial perspective disease perspective and labeling
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:08.900]   perspective right good morning Justin and good to hear from you the as I highlighted in my
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:15.300]   comments this morning the potential range of dosing duration for the rats trials is anywhere
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:21.620]   from one to two days on the acute end to 28 days on the more chronic or sub chronic
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.400]   end which reflects the phase 2 a trial that is the data in our corporate decks showing
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:32.140]   that after 28 days of administration of reproxelab there was a highly statistically significant
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:39.180]   reduction in rats levels as measured by Eliza I want to spend a few seconds talking about
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:45.980]   the two different ways to measure rats rats exist in our body in two forms so called free
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:52.220]   rats that are rats that are sort of floating around and then rats that are bound to proteins
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:59.240]   the Eliza measures rats bound to proteins and as you know Eliza is an antibody mediated
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:06.260]   detection assay the reason why we're able to generate antibodies to bound rats is that
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:13.780]   when rats bind to proteins they're antigens and form antibodies in some cases antibodies
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:20.220]   against self proteins so the Eliza measures bound rats and bound rats generally accumulate
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:26.660]   over time which is why in the phase 2 a study over 28 days we used the Eliza to assess rats
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:34.440]   levels on the other end of the spectrum regarding one to two day or acute dosing of reproxelab
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:42.180]   we think that techniques such as LCMS might be more relevant to assessing rats because
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:48.100]   there we'd be looking at free rats levels that would change acutely following dosing
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:57.320]   so somewhere within those two ranges of dosing paradigms and those two different assay techniques
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:06.480]   we will end up validating the precise technique and then establishing protocol design for the
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:15.020]   first of the rat studies to begin shortly okay great got it and maybe then you know how
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:20.020]   do you think about dosing regimens to be investigated and had conversations with the FDA on you know
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:25.300]   whether you'd have to do sort of you know QID or BID you know just to appreciate that
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:34.060]   you would be tapering and sort of the disease state eventually right and and that gets back
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:39.580]   to the first part of your question how might the clinical community perceive duration of
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:49.820]   dosing and dosing regimens first of all I think that signs of diseases including dry eye disease
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:57.980]   are primarily or first and foremost regulatory milestones I do not believe that certainly
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:04.020]   in the case of dry eye disease that either physicians or patients are particularly worried
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:10.640]   about signs patients do not wake up in the morning thinking I wonder what my Sherma test
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:17.060]   is I wonder what my corneal stain is and so forth instead we've used signs and I think
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:24.380]   most patients and physicians use signs as regulatory milestones so the dosing paradigm
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:31.140]   for trials associated purely with signs I think is a lot less important in this case for one
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:37.700]   to two dosing day the one to two-day dosing paradigm you're thinking of limited number
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:45.020]   of doses for the 28 day dosing paradigm I would expect we would dose QID which is the first
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:51.140]   phase of our induction maintenance dosing paradigm which was established with the release of the
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:59.900]   phase 3 renew trial back in December in terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:07.180]   for reproxelap in general and in terms of treating patients I think that the induction maintenance
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:15.700]   paradigm established with renew over 12 weeks really sets the tone and more precisely the
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:23.420]   label for how the drug will be used and that is a QID dosing initially followed by BID dosing
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:30.640]   for the maintenance phase okay that's really helpful maybe just a clarification question
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:37.540]   I know on the press leaf it says that there's going to be a dry NDA filing by the end of
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:43.300]   next year is the current thinking still to continue on or with a concurrent filing just
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.300]   you know I know later it says that AC is also going to be found just wondering if the expectation
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:53.900]   is that you would expect them together still our current thinking is that both will be filed
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:00.580]   together pending positive clinical data of course it turns out that the timelines for
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:08.780]   dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis continue to overlap the safety studies the efficacy
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:17.720]   studies the timeline for filing the NDA all of those seem to overlap for dry eye and allergic
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:25.300]   conjunctivitis at this point would suggest that a concurrent NDA is perhaps the best regulatory
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:31.860]   strategy but of course we'll have to see how events play out over the latter part of this
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:38.260]   year and the early part of next year before we can guide specifically on the possibility
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:45.140]   of a concurrent NDA we really do like the concurrent NDA paradigm however because of the overlap
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:51.460]   between dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis there seems to be about a 50% overlap such
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.980]   that about half the patients with dry eye disease complain of ocular itching and about
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:01.960]   half the patients with allergic conjunctivitis complain of dryness and a single compound
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.980]   that could treat both diseases or is indicated for both diseases would be highly advantageous
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:14.820]   not only to physicians but also to patients as well right great that makes a lot sense
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:19.540]   my last question is just you know on the safety study is there an expectation for what the
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:27.340]   size and scope you know duration as well number of patients you would anticipate for it right
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:36.300]   for dry eye disease my current understanding is that the FDA generally requires 100 patients
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:47.280]   complete one year of dosing however based on other other sponsors interactions with the
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:54.900]   agency we believe that we can file based on six months of safety data so what happens is
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:01.020]   most sponsors will over enroll they'll begin with more than 100 patients such that they
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:13.040]   have 100 completers at 12 months and to our knowledge the safety trials are fairly standard
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:21.780]   in dry eye disease I will say as I mentioned in my prepared comments that we've tested
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:30.500]   well over 1000 patients we have seen no safety signal no changes in intraocular pressure no
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:39.220]   retinal findings no aberrant corneal findings or any other safety signals that would suggest
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:44.860]   that there has been an issue with reproxylab dosing and any patient that's received drugs
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.020]   so far great thanks again and I'll hop back in the queue
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:30:06.380]   well thank you all again for joining us today as always we look forward to keeping you updated
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:19.660]   on our progress have a nice day thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300]   Good morning and welcome to Earthstone Energy Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call.
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.140]   At this time, while participants are in a listen-only mode,
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.840]   a brief question in the intersession will follow the formal presentation.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.540]   If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press Star Zero on your telephone keypad.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.400]   As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.960]   Joining us today from Earthstone are Robert Anderson, President and Chief Executive Officer,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.940]   Mark Lumpkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.500]   and Scott Thielander, Vice President of Finance.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.380]   Mr. Thielander, you may begin.
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.680]   Thank you and welcome to our Second Quarter Conference Call.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.900]   Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.540]   within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.900]   and Section 21(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.640]   Although management believes these statements are based on reasonable expectations,
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.200]   they can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640]   These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.740]   as described in the earnings announcement we released yesterday
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.240]   and in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10(k) and subsequent quarterly filings.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.540]   These documents can be found in the Investor's Section of our website, www.EarthstoneEnergy.com.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.480]   Should one or more of these risks materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.940]   actual results may vary materially.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.600]   This conference call also includes references to certain non-gap financial measures
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.900]   which include adjusted diluted shares, adjusted EBIDACs, adjusted net income,
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.900]   all-in-cash costs, cash GNA and pre-cash flow.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.600]   Reconciliations of these non-gap financial measures to the most directly comparable measure under GAP
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.800]   are contained in our earnings announcement released yesterday.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.900]   Also, please note information on this call speaks only as of today, August 6, 2020.

[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.400]   Today's call will begin with comments from Robert Anderson, our CEO,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.600]   followed by remarks from our CFO, Mark Lumpkin, regarding financial measures and financial matters in performance,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.300]   and then some closing comments from Robert.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.800]   I'll now turn the call over to Robert.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.300]   Thank you Scott and good morning everyone and appreciate everyone's attendance for our call today.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.800]   Thanks for making time to join us for our second quarter conference call.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.300]   In the midst of the current pandemic, we continue to take appropriate caution
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.400]   and maintain focus on keeping our personnel safe while continuing to efficiently manage our operations.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.000]   Achieving our strong second quarter results in the face of this unprecedented oil price collapse
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.600]   and difficult operating environment is evidence of the resiliency of our business plan
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.200]   and the solid commitment of our people.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   Throughout these trying times, we have worked to quickly adjust to the rapidly changing conditions
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.400]   and align our costs with our business activity as well as preserve our strengths.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   As we have discussed last quarter and in updates along the way,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.000]   stating we would be free cash flow positive from the second quarter on for 2020,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.800]   we had significant free cash flow of $35 million in this quarter.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.000]   This was driven by several factors including limited capital expenditures in the quarter
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.900]   as we completed our drilling and completion program for the year,
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.900]   strong hedge position that delivered over $29 million of realizations
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.700]   and significantly lower operating costs partially as a result of our May shut-in and containment program
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.300]   but also sustainable reductions.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.200]   Including the impact of our shut-in program, our average daily sales volume in the second quarter
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.600]   was 13,555 barrels of oil equivalent or BOE per day.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.700]   Even with reduced volumes and a 44% drop in average realized price per BOE in the second quarter,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.100]   our cost management efforts combined with the strong hedge position allowed us to generate
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.700]   higher quarter over quarter adjusted net income and adjusted EBITACs.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.900]   I suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.100]   We expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the balance of the year
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.200]   which should result in a decreasing debt balance and help us achieve our target
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.700]   of being below one times debt to EBITACs for the year.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.100]   As we previously discussed in response to the sharp decline in oil prices in April
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.300]   and very low forecasted May oil prices,
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.100]   we made the decision in late April to shut in the large majority of our operated production for the month of May
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.200]   which resulted in approximately 60% of our total net production being shut in during May
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.900]   with a forecast of significantly improved June oil prices
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.300]   which ultimately were more than double our April and May oil price realizations,
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.100]   we returned to full production in June.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.300]   We had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:53.700]   which saw us reduce total lease operating expense or LOE in the second quarter by 40% from the prior quarter.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.700]   Despite reduced production volumes due to our shut in program in May,
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:04.800]   our teams continued focused on cost reductions resulted in a 30% decrease in LOE per BOE
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:12.300]   in the second quarter to $4.53 versus $6.51 in the first quarter.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.400]   This was the major driver of the overall 33% reduction in all-in cash cost during the quarter.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   On a per unit basis, our all-in cash cost went from near $13 per BOE in the first quarter
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.000]   to near $10 per BOE in the second quarter for a total 22% reduction.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.300]   This is all-in cash cost folks which includes operating costs, corporate GNA costs
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.400]   and all of our interest costs on our debt.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.500]   To dive a little deeper into how we achieve the 40% decrease in LOE,
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   let me outline some of the key factors.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.000]   First, as much of our peers have done, we were successful in negotiating price reductions
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   with vendors across the broad range of our lease operating expenses,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.200]   from chemicals to maintenance rigs, saltwater disposal contracts and compression costs.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.000]   Second, we are benefiting from our long-term practice of spending a little more money
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.500]   as we go repairing wells, facilities and associated equipment to reduce frequency of maintenance
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.900]   which is resulting in a continued decrease in non-routine LOE repair needs.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.600]   Third, workover repairs have trended down resulting from our optimization of lift method,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.200]   chemical program improvements and general approach of fixing things right the first time.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:42.400]   The limited offset frack activity also reduced frack hit related workover expenses.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.000]   Fourth, we have been successful in getting the utility companies to perform electrical upgrades
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.300]   sooner than scheduled which has allowed us to eliminate generator usage on some of our newer locations.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.400]   Lastly, with limited drilling and completion activity,
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.600]   we have also been able to refocus our field employees towards lease maintenance
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.100]   which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.300]   All of these items and many other subtleties of operating were in progress
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.100]   as our team has a history of continually driving down costs.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:20.200]   We will remain focused on continuing to reduce costs across the board as we expect the oil price environment
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:27.100]   that we have observed since late 2014 including increased volatility to persist
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:34.300]   which only stresses the need to structure our business to be profitable across a much lower oil price range.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.700]   I'd really like to commend our operations team which did a fantastic job
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.000]   of both shutting in production in May and bringing production back fully online in June
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.300]   while also achieving these cost reductions.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.000]   For the first time in my career and our team's history,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.700]   we had to tell our guys to produce as little as possible every single day.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.500]   We executed this shut-in operations and our field personnel did a great job of efficiently returning wells
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.900]   to production with little to no incremental expense and no adverse effects on our producers.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:11.900]   Our wells have returned to their previous volumes with some wells producing at increased rates for a period of time.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.900]   Plus the three wells in southeast Reagan County that were brought online in April
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.600]   prior to the curtailment and were shut in during May are now back online
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.400]   and have fully cleaned up and are performing well versus the tight curve.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.100]   I mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in late May
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.800]   and released our contracted rig operating in the Midland Basin.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.500]   So our planned capital expenditures are minimal for the balance of the year
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.700]   given that our program ended with 11 wells drilled but not completed
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:52.700]   and with our ample liquidity we have optionality on completion timing depending on market conditions.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.400]   With production return to full capacity we have entered the second half of this year
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.800]   with expectations for no further drilling or completion activity this year.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.700]   We can maintain approximately flat year over year production in 2020 compared to 2019.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.340]   As a reminder we recently updated our 2020 full year production guidance
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.600]   ranging from 13,000 to 14,000 BOE per day
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:23.400]   which compares to 2019 full year average of 13,429 BOE per day.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.700]   Further with our 11 drilled but uncompleted wells in Upton County
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.800]   we intend to carefully monitor commodity pricing appropriate service availability
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.900]   and service cost conditions to determine if it makes sense to bring in a completion crew
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.200]   later this year or wait until early next year.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.100]   Depending on the timing we anticipate the completion of those 11 wells
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:50.200]   would enable us to maintain similar year over year production for 2021
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.800]   with only a modest capital program for the completions
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   which we currently estimate at around $30 million.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.500]   With that overview I'll now turn the call over to Mark to review the financials.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.900]   Thank you Robert.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.300]   As we have in the past two consecutive quarters
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.900]   I'd like to first discuss our cash position in our balance sheet.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.600]   As Robert mentioned we are pleased to have achieved our goal
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.300]   of generating substantial pre-cash flow in the quarter
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.700]   with a total of $35.1 million of pre-cash flow.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.800]   As we represent our first quarter call
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.700]   our plan was first to reduce our working capital deficit
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.300]   which we calculate excluding derivatives
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.400]   and we're able to do this by over $50 million during the second quarter
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.900]   and then to begin to pay down our revolver debt.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.800]   The barn based under our senior security revolving facility
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   which was set in late March remains unchanged at $275 million
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.600]   and should remain there until our regularly scheduled fall redetermination process.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.200]   Our outstanding barings under the credit facility at quarter ends hold $168.6 million
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.000]   and we had $1.8 million in cash.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.500]   With $106.4 million of unused barn capacity
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.400]   that gave us approximately $108 million of liquidity quarter ends.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.500]   I would note that as of July 31st
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.700]   we had paid down our revolver by $14.3 million compared to quarter end
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:14.000]   reducing our debt balance now to about $154.3 million
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.600]   and we did expect to apply pre-cash flow
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.600]   the remainder of the year primarily to pay down the revolver.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.300]   During the second quarter our capital expenditures settled $3.2 million
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.100]   and year to date we have spent $45 million of our annual 2020 capital budget
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.000]   of $50 to $60 million.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.200]   As Robert mentioned we concluded our 2020 drilling program in May
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.300]   so we anticipate minimal expenditures during the remainder of the year
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.700]   and will likely end up toward the low end of our guidance range.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.800]   Now looking at our second quarter income statement starting with the top line
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.900]   revenue for the second quarter of 2020 were $21.7 million
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.900]   compared to $45.1 million in the first quarter.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.900]   The decline was driven by a 54% decrease in oil revenues to $18.9 million
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.700]   which made up about 87% of total revenues
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:06.400]   and the NGL revenues fell by 44% while natural gas revenues rose quietly.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   Our average price in the second quarter for all three commodities
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   was $17.56 per barrel of oil equivalent
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.900]   which was down by nearly half of our average price during the first quarter.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.400]   By commodity our average price per crude oil in the second quarter
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.700]   was $23.56 per barrel, natural gas at average $0.83 per MCF
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:31.900]   and NGL average $8.10 per barrel of oil equivalent.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.900]   From our production standpoint our second quarter sales volumes
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.900]   averaged $13,555 barrels of oil equivalent per day
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.900]   which was comprised of 65% oil, 18% natural gas
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.700]   and 17% natural gas liquids.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.700]   As highlighted this does include having curtailed about 60%
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.700]   of total production in May.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.200]   On the expense side as Robert also highlighted
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   we did drive down our all impact costs from $12.92 per BOE
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   in the first quarter to $10.11 per BOE in the second quarter.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.700]   We achieved this through nearly $2 per BOE reduction
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.200]   at our least operating expense to $4.52 per BOE for the quarter.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   On the general administrative side
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.700]   we reduced our absolute cash GNA expense by about 7%
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.200]   versus the first quarter
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.700]   which resulted in per unit cash GNA expense of $3.34 per BOE.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.700]   As you know we reduced our cash GNA guidance in May
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.700]   to $15.5 to $16.5 million for the full year
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.700]   and expect to be somewhere in that range
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.700]   which at the bottom end is a 25% reduction
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.200]   versus our initial full year plan.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   In addition to some of the savings we articulated last quarter
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   we maintained a focus on and have had success
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.700]   in reducing expenses really anywhere and everywhere
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.700]   including reduced uses of third party consultants
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.700]   reducing vendor rates and managing our costs tightly.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.700]   From an income standpoint
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.700]   we reported GAT net loss in the second quarter
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.200]   of $35.9 million or $0.55 per share
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.700]   which included a pre-taxed unrealized loss
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.200]   of $50 million on our derivative contracts.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   Our adjusted net income was $12.8 million
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   or $0.20 per guillotine share, adjustable guillotine share
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   for the second quarter.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   We reported adjusted EVET Act of $39.8 million in the second quarter
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   which as Robert mentioned is actually an increased quarter of a quarter.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   Now let's take a minute to update you on our commodity hedges results
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   in the second quarter.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   As highlighted we realized $29.4 million are a gain
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   on our commodity hedges for the quarter.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   This is largely reflective of our hedge position entering the quarter
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   and unlocking in some really nice gains on hedges
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   when we made the decision to procure production
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   and did that when second quarter NIMEX prices were about up to the lowest point.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   The hedge realizations also include a gain of about $5.7 million
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   from an unwind of $1,000 barrels of oil a day
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   for the second half of 2020.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   We remained really well ahead for the bout of the year
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   with an average of $6,500 barrels per day of oil
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   swapped at a NIMEX price of $58.35
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   stepping down to $4,000 barrels a day for four year 2021
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   at a NIMEX price of $55.16 per barrel
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   with basis hedges in place on similar volumes.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   On the natural gas slide we have 7,000 MMBTU per day
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   swapped at a Henry hub price of $2.85
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   for the second half of this year
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   stepping up to 8,000 MMBTUs per day
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   at a price of $2.71 for four year 2021
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   with basis hedges in place on the same volumes.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   Hedges were made into critical component of our financial strategy
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   and we expect to continue layering on hedges
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   as we get more visibility around the resumption
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   of our drill and completion activity going forward.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   Stepping back and looking at our expectations for four year 2020
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   we reinstated our production guidance in July
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   and we reinstated LLE in production
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   and Avalor and tax guidance with our earnings released yesterday.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   Our reinstated production Avalor and tax guidance
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   at 6.25% to 7.25% is identical to what it was
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   at the onset of our 2020 guidance provided in January
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   as is the case for our reinstated LLE guidance
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   of $5.50 to $6.00 for BOE.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   Although we have had recent sustainable LLE reductions
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   and came in well below this range in the second quarter
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   without the advantage of bringing on new wells
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   we have kept our guidance range where it was at the beginning of the year
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   when we anticipated bringing 16 new wells online.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   Thank you, Mark. We are really pleased with the results
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   and confident in a bright future for Ergestone.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   While we are sorry to see our industry in such distress
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   it is creating more M&A opportunities than we have seen
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   in quite some time.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.200]   We are actively evaluating a number of situations
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   and expect to have more to consider throughout the rest of the year
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.200]   as prices remain low
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.200]   and distress situations continue to increase.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   We believe that our strong balance sheet and track record
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   as a successful consolidator positions us well
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.200]   to increase the scale of our company
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   and add value to our shareholders.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   With that operator we'll now open the floor for questions.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question and answer session.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   If you'd like to ask a question please press start button
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   under telephone keypad.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   You may press start too if you'd like to remove your question from the queue.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   For participants using speaker equipment
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   it may be necessary to pick up your handset
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   before pressing the start key.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   Our first question comes from the line
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   Hi morning everyone hope you're doing well.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   I guess on the 2021 color that you gave about being able
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   to keep production flat with the 11 ducks
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   is that more just meant to be instructive
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   or is that actually how you're thinking about the 2021 plan
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   as we fit here today?
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   Yes, a little bit of both Brad.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   You know it does depend on where commodity prices
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   head towards the end of the year whether we want to pick up a rig or not.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   I think we've been pretty vocal or consistent about our message
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   that we need mid 45 to 50 dollar oil
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   to want to go back to spending large capital dollars
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   but outside of that at some point into this year early next year
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   completing those wells will allow us to main production flat year over year.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   Okay good and then obviously you made a comment on M&A.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   Can you go into a little more detail about
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   sort of what opportunities you're seeing
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   and also any thoughts you have about an ability to fund them?
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   The opportunities are increasing
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   and size is variable from small to quite large
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   as you've seen you know distressed and bankrupt companies
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:10.200]   I think all of this will result in further opportunities
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:15.200]   in terms of larger company selling assets.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   It is difficult with no public equity
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   and for that matter debt markets open or open only to a very few.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.200]   Maybe we're one of those few but we've had discussions
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   with financial parties who are interested
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   in participating with us on acquisitions
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   and much like we've done in our history
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   we'll bring in parties at the right time to look at buying assets
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   and we're going to maintain a very healthy leverage amount
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   and keep ourselves from getting into a distress
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   no matter where we are in the cycle.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   So I think we're just going to see more and more opportunities
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.200]   and we'll figure out how we can finance those
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   and make sure we keep our balance sheet clean.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   Okay, thanks for the comment.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   Thank you.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   Our next question comes from the line of Neil Dingman
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   with Truist Securities.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   Good morning all, Robert.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   First question also on that same line on 21 Expectations
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   and I'm just wondering why I realized this plan really
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   I think at least the one you just initial laid out
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   it seems no new wells.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   Really what I'm just wondering what's driving this low cost
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   or another way maybe ask is how you think about maintenance capex
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   given just so low because if I recall,
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   I thought Frank already had you all cancel
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   those Country Club and other memberships.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   I just know what else is there.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   Yes, there's no Country Club memberships up here.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   The 11 wells we have are in really good areas
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   and they will help us keep production relatively flat
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   at $30 million.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   Now is that sustainable?
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   Absolutely not.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   We still have a relatively high decline rate
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   and it does depend on when we brought those wells online.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   If we waited until the very end of 21,
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   we're going to have a hard time keeping production relatively flat.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.200]   If we brought them on today,
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.200]   we might have the same problem because we get all this flush production
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   from these new wells.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   To maintain 13,000 BOE a day kind of level longer term,
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   we're going to have to have a rig running and a one rig program.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.200]   I don't know what it would exactly cost us today,
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   but generally speaking is $120 million to maybe $140 million
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   depending on lateral length and working interest
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   and things like that.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   This is just a very preliminary.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   If the world stays the same and we're at low $40 environment,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   we're not spending any drilling capital,
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.200]   these 11 ducks will help us keep production flat.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   You hit on my last one.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   How do you think about PDP decline on a go forward?
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   Now that you've been slowing a bit,
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.200]   is that going to go down or I guess we'll get another way?
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   Are you able to give us how many wells would offset that?
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   In any way you can give us a caller on how you're thinking about that
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   in 21 on broader terms.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   I think we've been consistent in telling everyone
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   that our basic line starting today is about 30% in the first year
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   and then it gets into the mid to maybe 26 or 27% the next year
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   and then low 20s or high teens after that.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   I don't think that's changed any and if we didn't spend any capital
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:12.200]   then you can forecast what our blow down production would look like.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   Even if we didn't do those 11 wells,
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.200]   but again with those 11 wells it'll help keep 21 flat
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   and then going forward in 22 and beyond.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.200]   It's all going to depend on price.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   Very good. Thanks, Chris.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.200]   Thank you.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   Our next question comes from line of Jeff Graf with Northland Capital Markets.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   Thank you guys.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   I was wondering Robert or maybe some Mark,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   how important do you guys think precast flow positive in the context
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   of evaluating whether to go after this deduction
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   and potentially drill under it at some point in time?
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   Would you view that as kind of a must, if you will,
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   or would you guys have any level of comfort with any near medium term
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.200]   outstand that could help if the returns were good
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   and it would help kind of jumpstart a return to growth?
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   Sure. Maybe I'll try to answer that one
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   then Robert can add on if he wants to.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   We keep things pretty simple.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   At the end of the day we feel like our responsibility
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   is to make good individual decisions at the wellhead
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.200]   and that's why we were quick to put the rig down
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.200]   and stop completing in March and April
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   is because the economics didn't make a whole lot of sense then.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   Did the ducks make sense right now?
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   Economically you definitely could go complete the ducks right now
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   and have pretty nice IRRs for the incremental cost to complete them.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   In terms of, are we so focused on quarter to quarter
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   or year to year pre-cash flow that we won't outspend?
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   No, we're not and from a practical matter
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   we're just going to be pre-cashable positive this year
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   and next year kind of irrespective of anything else
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   that happens with prices if all we're doing is completing the ducks.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.200]   At some point we do anticipate picking the rig back up
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   and there's obviously a lag there
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   between the cost you expend to drill in the complete wells
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   versus the cash flow.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   Does that mean over the course of the year
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   we're not pre-cashable positive?
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   No, not necessarily,
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:26.200]   but we're not so fixated on checking that box every quarter.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   We want to make smart economic decisions at the wellhead
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   that will flow into the bigger picture
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   and having some outspend for some period of time
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   we still think is supported by the economics
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   at the same time,
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   we're not ones just to go keep drilling and completing
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   because we have hedges in place or for other reasons.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.200]   We're just trying to get as serious as we can
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.200]   of the individual decisions we're making at the wellhead.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.200]   Yeah, the only thing I'll add Jeff is I think
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   we can run a one-rig program with the level of production
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   and cash flow we have today
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   and be cash flow neutral on an annualized basis.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   Obviously there's a jumpstarting the program
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   we're going to be cash flow negative for a period of time
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.200]   but I think longer term over a year timeframe.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   Again, depending on what the price is.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.200]   Sure, understood appreciate those comments.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   My follow-up and you guys still have a decent amount
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   of non-off exposure in the Permian.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   Are you guys seeing any activity levels there
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   and more on the land side?
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.200]   Is there any traction or conversations
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   on swapping any of that out
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.200]   to increase the operating exposure there?
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   Still working on the trades
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.200]   but people have been hunkered down in the bunker
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   for quite some time now since at least March
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   and so nothing's moving very quickly there.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   We have not heard anything different
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   from our partners in terms of activity
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   in the near term being kind of the remainder this year
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   so we'll have to see as we get closer to year end
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.200]   what their view might be for activity in 2021.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   All right, thank you.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   Thank you.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   Our next question comes from line of Duncan McIntosh
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   with Johnson Wright.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.200]   I had a quick question over on the balance sheet.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   Y'all are doing a great job in the free cash.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   That looks great paying it down.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   Have you been in conversations with the banks
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   as we head into the fall redetermination
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.200]   back in March?
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.200]   Y'all are early and getting it done in the spring
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.200]   but back then it looked like things would be pretty dire
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   getting in the fall and it's not as bad here
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   and particularly with the line of sight y'all have on the free cash
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   kind of how any conversations have been
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   to give you any indication as to what
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   the fall redetermination could look like.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.200]   Sure, I mean probably too early to sort of anything around numbers
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.200]   but we do pretty rarely talk to banks
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.200]   and we do that normal course irrespective of the environment.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   The one thing I can for us,
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   we are expecting a decrease in the baron base
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   and obviously we're not drilling and completing new wells
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.200]   and hedges roll off.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.200]   Fortunately we feel like we've got enough ability
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.200]   to pay down debt to outpace that decrease
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.200]   and really we don't see any scenarios
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   that we think are realistic
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   that would be concerning in that regard.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   Now I will say does the environment feel better
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   now than it did three months ago?
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   Absolutely and maybe some of that's the shock
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   of seeing minus 37 hour oil and teen realizations
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   for the months of April and May.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.200]   I think at the end of the day
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   it's still not a very good price environment
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   for companies in general
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   and the banks maybe they feel a little better
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.200]   because we're at $45 or $42 versus somewhere in the teens
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   but they still have a lot of issues to deal with
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   and obviously there's been a lot of EMP companies
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   that have gone bankrupt
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   and there's certainly more that will.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   So the banks still have their hands full
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.200]   and they're still working through all these situations.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   I think there is a lot of trepidation
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   in the banks part in general
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:37.200]   and I don't frankly see them letting up a whole bunch
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   in the fall.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.200]   Now that being said, that's a general statement.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   We've got one time leverage and liquidity
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.200]   and generally are viewed as having done the right thing
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.200]   from a financial standpoint
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   and our assets are better than many.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   We probably feel like we've got a pretty supportive bank group
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.200]   that is going to be reasonable and fair
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   and historically that's been the case
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   but too early to circle a number.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   Thanks Mark and then I guess just for my follow-up,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   Robert you gave some really good color
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   and you all did some pretty creative things
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.200]   to get LOE down in the second quarter.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   I know you talked about how it's going to come back up
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   a little bit here in the back half of the year
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   towards a more historical range
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.200]   but any of those initiatives that you took
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   do you think that you can carry forward
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   to kind of help mitigate that LOE creep?
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   It's definitely done.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   It's just a constant progression of a well's life cycle
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   to adjust artificial lift.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   A lot of our wells are on gas lift
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.200]   so relatively expensive compressors.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   Over time that gets changed out to other lift methods.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   In some cases rod pump and other cases plunger lift
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   what have you.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   We're continuing to work through that
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.200]   and that will definitely help reduce LOE
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   and then some of the things that we were fortunate
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   in getting done in the quarter
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   working with the utility company to get meters set
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   and get ahead of the schedule there
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.200]   or moved up in the schedule from some good relationships.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   We ended up getting generators off of our payroll
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   and those are very, very expensive
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.200]   so we didn't have a whole lot
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   but they still show up as a big expense
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   so some of these things we did in the second quarter
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.200]   are sustainable and we'll continue doing the right things
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.200]   in the way we operate our business
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   and continue to watch costs like a hawk.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   All right thank you all very much
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.200]   and congratulations strong quarter and a strong outlook.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   Thank you.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.200]   Thank you ladies and gentlemen as a reminder
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   if you'd like to join the question queue
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   please press star one on your telephone keypad.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   Our next question comes from a line of Noel Parks
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   with Koker and Palmer.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   Please proceed with your question.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   Hey good morning.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   I know.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   You know I was thinking about having the buck inventory
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   where it works out that just completing those next year
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.200]   can help you keep production flat.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   That's a lot of really great flexibility you have there
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   and I mean was that just sort of a result
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   of the timing of everything you know
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   kind of falling off the rails with COVID
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:48.200]   and overt Russia or was that sort of part of the plan
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   as you were just trying to continue to pivot
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   to emphasis on free cash flow hitting it next year?
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   I'd love to tell you Noel that we had this great plan
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   that no matter what happened in the world
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   oil going to 20 or sub 20
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   that we could keep production flat for three years running
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   with various amounts of capital.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   If you go back and think about the beginning of the year
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   and the call we had you know
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   related to the fourth quarter earnings in full year
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   we had a one rate program
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.200]   we were going to average for the entire year
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   a tiny bit of free cash flow
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   and those 11 wells would have been completed
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   I don't know if by now I can't remember
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   but pretty darn close.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.200]   So I'd say it's a fallout of what's happened here
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   and just being very conservative
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   with our capital expenditures and cash
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:57.200]   and making sure that we come out of this near term down cycle
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   we've been in a down cycle since 2014
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   but at least this recent piece of it
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   that we survived nicely through it
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.200]   and come out the other side
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   and continue to find ways to consolidate and grow.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   Great thanks and you were just a housekeeping question
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   and sorry if you touched on this earlier
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   and I missed it.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.200]   For the free cash flow calculation
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   if I looked at the numbers right
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   it looked like this is one of those periods
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   where there was a pretty big delta
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   between I guess you'd say cash capex
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.200]   and sort of capex incurred in the quarter
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.200]   and I was just wondering
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   for the free cash flow calculation
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   going forward there's just kind of
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   which one of those is more important for us to use
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.200]   as we just try to model that.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   We always use accrued cash from a calculation standpoint
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.200]   because not all the bills necessarily have hit
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   but we know what generally they are.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   So it's in the presentation on the last page
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   or something like that.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   One other thing and I just don't have a release in front of me
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   and as far as changing working capital
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   that's something else you would routinely include
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   the impact of in a free cash calculation
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   or would you exclude that?
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   So we don't include that
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   and I recognize there's multiple different ways
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   to look at that.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.200]   The way we've been approaching it
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.200]   is adjusted EBIT Act is the best proxy
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   for really sort of cash flow for the period.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   We back out interest expense
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   and then we back out capital expenditures
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.200]   for activity during that period.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   Now when your stocking is starting
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   there is going to be a bigger delta
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   between calculating the free cash flow the way we do
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   versus if you're using a cash capex number.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   The second quarter was very atypical from the standpoint
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   of here we're reporting $35 million of free cash flow
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   and our debt balance went up
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   and the reason for that is because
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   and of course this is tied to the cash capex
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   it's just the time of the payments.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   We reduced the working capital deficit
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   by about $50 million during the quarter.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   Now we're to a point where that working capital deficit
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   is pretty low and probably won't fluctuate
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   a whole bunch one way or the other
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   until we pick activity back up
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   at which point you'd expect as you start
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   completions and drilling again
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   you start getting bills but there's some lag
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   between the activity and when you get the bills
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   and when you pay them so very typical quarter.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.200]   Yeah, as we mentioned the press release
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   we had about $169 million of debt at quarter end
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   and the month of July we paid down a little more than $14 million.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   That's not the run rate by the way
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   it's not $14 million a quarter
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.200]   that was high because of timing
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   but we do expect really every month this year
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   that we're paying down some debt
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   without any big changes in the working capital status.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   Great. Thanks a lot for the details. That's about for me.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   Thank you ladies and gentlemen
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.200]   that concludes our question and answer session.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Anderson
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.200]   for any final comments.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   We appreciate everybody joining us
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   and we'll continue to update as we need to
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   and we'll see you next quarter. Thanks.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.200]   Thank you. This concludes today's conference.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   You may disconnect your lines at this time.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   Thank you for your participation.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Good day and welcome to this first second quarter 2020 financial results and corporate
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.360]   update conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. As a reminder today's
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.560]   conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce you, your host for today's conference
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.840]   Alexander Fujifilis, Head of Investor Relations at Ferns. Please go ahead.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.760]   Thank you Charlotte. I'd like to welcome and thank you all for joining us today for
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.360]   Affimate's second quarter 2020 financial results and operational progress conference call.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.480]   Before we begin, I would like to encourage everyone to go to the Investor Relations
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.240]   section of Affimate's website to find the earnings release and related financial tables.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.440]   We also post the slides on our website that follow our discussion today.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.560]   On the call today we are joined by Dr. Adi Hurst, our Chief Executive Officer, Andreas
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:08.320]   Hartstrick, Chief Medical Officer, Arnst Satellius, Chief Scientific Officer and Angus Smith, our new
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.720]   Chief Financial Officer who joined us in July. We are also joined by Dr. Wolfgang Fischer, our
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.960]   Chief Operating Officer and Ms. Denise Miller, Chief Business Officer. They will also be available
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.880]   for the Q&A session. Before we start, I will quickly go through the Safe Harbour Statement.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.960]   Today's discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements regarding future events.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.800]   These statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this call.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.920]   Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.440]   or to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.880]   in the forward-looking statement, even if new information becomes available in the future.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.120]   These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual results
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.520]   may differ materially from those expressed or implied in this statement due to various factors
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.600]   including but not limited to those identified under the section entitled risk factors
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.720]   and our filings with the SEC and those identified under the section entitled
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.760]   forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued today and filed with the SEC.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.560]   With that, I will turn the call over to Adi. Adi? Thank you, Alex. Good morning,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.720]   everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter business update call.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.680]   Today we have some updates to share with you on our operational progress
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.960]   as well as on our financial results. While we're still in the middle of a serious
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.440]   global health pandemic and a challenging economic downturn
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.960]   and aftermath, we are quite confident that the steps we're taking in advancing our science
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.760]   and moving our pipeline forward are beginning to yield data that demonstrate
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.640]   the long-term potential of our innovative approaches and products.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.320]   COVID-19 continues to affect societies around the world and we hope that you and your families
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.400]   are well and safe. We are observing some impact by COVID-19 on the progress of our clinical studies
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.560]   however, it's at last and we're taking great efforts to minimize them. As a result, we have
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.720]   been able to continue our progress on the clinical studies of AFM 13 in peripheral Tysal lymphoma
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.880]   and of AFM 24 in each AFR positive tumors and which is very exciting for us,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:57.760]   genetic dose, the first patient with RO729709 which, as you remember, is the BCMA CT16A in
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.960]   cell engagement. We're also making good progress on our pre-clinical pipeline.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.720]   For our lead candidate AFM 13, our study in patients who have relapsed or refractory
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.280]   peripheral Tysal lymphoma in exhausted available standard of care treatments
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.400]   are now being treated with AFM 13 as a single agent. We are executing according to our development
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.480]   timelines and, as previously stated, expect to complete the pre-determined interim analysis
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:37.600]   in mid 2021. We're also looking at options to enhance AFM 13's efficacy beyond monotherapy.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.440]   The first of these options is the combination with allergenic and K cells in a study
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.600]   that is conducted at the MD Anderson cancer institute and on IST.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.920]   MD Anderson website now shows that the study is enrolling but the initiation is impacted
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.880]   by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Texas. A first patient in the study is expected as soon as this
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   situation improves. For AFM 24, we disclosed that we have completed the first cohort
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.240]   of our dose escalation study without any dose limiting toxicities
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.720]   and we're currently recruiting into the second dose cohort.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.800]   We have all four planned sites active and recruiting. Following the completion of the dose escalation
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.920]   phase of the study, we have the option to enroll patients into tumor specific expansion cohorts
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.160]   where we will look for single agent activity in a number of well defined tumor types. In addition,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.000]   we're planning to initiate combination studies with checkpoint inhibitors and we will be providing
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.360]   updates as the program continues to make progress. We're very pleased with the continued progress
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.160]   in our collaboration with the Genentech. Importantly, the phase one clinical study with the BCMA CT16A
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.960]   inertial engager is now enrolling patients. This achievement represents the third inertial
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.040]   engager to enter the clinic and triggers our milestone payment to us during the third quarter
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.800]   in an amount that we're not able to disclose. Last month, Angus Smith joined us as chief financial
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:30.320]   officer. Angus will introduce himself later and discuss our financial position and the flexibility
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.600]   provides us to continue to execute on our strategy and drive future growth of our company.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.160]   During the annual annual meeting of shareholders which was held in August 4,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.040]   we are happy to report that all proposed agenda items were approved.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.440]   This includes the addition of Dr. Annalisa Jenkins and Harry Welton to the supervisor
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:00.960]   report as new members. Annalisa is a visionary leader who knows how to translate signs from bench
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.120]   to bedside and Harry is an accomplished financial executive who will help drive value creating
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.400]   strategies for the company. These additions to the supervisor report further strengthen the
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:21.440]   company's industry knowhow experience and diversity. As it has only been a month and a half since we
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.240]   last spoke to you, we thought we would focus today's discussion on company achievements thus far
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.920]   and what gives us confidence in our signs. Update you on our programs and allow plenty
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:38.400]   of time for Q&A. To get it, I will now hand over the call to Andreas Horstreich, our chief medical
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.000]   officer to give you a brief update on our clinical stage programs. Andreas?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.280]   Yeah, thank you Adi for the introduction and thank you all for joining us today and I'm happy
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:00.000]   to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs that we made over the last
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.560]   three months. As you all aware, COVID-19 pandemic is still present globally and it continues to
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.080]   pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment of patients.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:22.880]   The two guiding principles we are employing at AFIMED is to ensure patient safety on the studies
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.160]   and to ensure trial data integrity and this is in line, I think, with our guidances given from
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.280]   all competent authorities. Within this framework, however, the AFIMED team is very proactively
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:44.800]   working with all of our participating sites to make sure that our innovative treatment
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:52.640]   is still available for patients in need of new therapeutics and that we minimize the impact
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:09:00.080]   of COVID-19 to a minimum possible. One important achievement in this regard is that we were able
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.560]   to secure drug supply for all of our ongoing studies and can ensure uninterrupted treatment
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:15.200]   of all patients. To go into more detail, let's start with AFM 13, our most advanced program first.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:26.400]   As you know, AFM 13 is in registration directed phase two study AFM 13202 treating patients with
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:33.200]   relapsed and refractory peripheral T cell lymphomas who have exhausted all available
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:42.400]   standard of care options. The enrollment into this study is at a steady state. We were able to
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.200]   activate 54 sites now contributing patients in 10 countries around the globe.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:58.960]   As you know, this study has Simon two-stage design with a pre-planned interim analysis
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:07.760]   after 40 patients in the PTCL cohorts and as Adi said, we are confident that we will have the
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:15.360]   data from this interim analysis available by the middle of next year. There was also a third cohort
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.760]   or there is a third cohort in this study for patients with transformed mucosis Fungoidus,
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:29.040]   so a cutaneous form of T cell lymphomas. This third cohort with mucosis Fungoidus was never
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.720]   part and never intended to be part of the registration program. It was a proof of concept
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:43.120]   cohort only and for COVID-19 related restrictions the enrollment into this cohort is currently on hold.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:50.720]   As Adi also mentioned, we are continuing to make progress in our collaboration with MD Anderson
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:59.680]   Cancer Center where we have an active IND for our first phase one study of AFM 13 in combination
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:07.920]   with allergenic national killer cells. As Adi said, the current status at the MD Anderson
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.880]   web page is recruiting and we know that our patients are currently screened and considered
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:22.000]   and we are expecting to the enrollment of the first patient as soon as COVID-19 related restrictions
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:32.720]   at MD Anderson lift up. Now let's move to our second program AFM 24. As you know by specific
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:39.840]   tetravalent molecule targeting both CD16A to activate national killer cells and macrophages
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:48.320]   and the EGF receptor on solid tumors. This compound is in a phase one dose escalation
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:56.880]   part of the 101 study and we are happy to report that we were able to activate all four pre-planned
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:04.560]   sites and all four pre-planned sites are contributing patients. As we disclosed earlier we have completed
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:11.200]   cohort one without observing dose limiting toxicities and are actively recruiting into
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:22.800]   dose cohort two. With this I close the overview of the clinical progress and I'm happy to hand
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:30.240]   over to my colleague Arnchotelius chief scientific officer who will review with you some of our
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:37.120]   pre-clinical data that make us so excited about the opportunities that we can create for patients
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:46.000]   with ICE and activating the innate immune system. Arnchotelius. Thank you Andreas and thank you
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.520]   all for joining. In the next few minutes I would like to summarize as Andreas mentioned the pre-clinical
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:01.360]   and clinical data observed so far with our innate cell engagers providing evidence that these molecules
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:11.120]   are potent and safe drug candidates. I'll start by summarizing the data showing that our ICEs
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:21.280]   are potent molecules. As you see on slide five if we take AFM13 as an example AFM13 has been shown
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:29.520]   strong single agent anti-tumor responses and T cell informa with a normal response rate of 50%.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.840]   The molecule has also shown promising signs of broad clinical development potential in augmenting
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:45.120]   other IO therapies such as PD1 inhibitors. For example in the Hodgkin lymphoma phase 1B study
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   we've seen an impressive overall response rate of 88% with a complete response rate of 42%
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:03.040]   and 46% in the local and the central read respectively. In the low part of the slide we've also highlighted
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:12.320]   for you presentations of the studies past and in the future. Additionally our own experience
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:19.440]   and the work with Andy Anderson we have seen promising pre-clinical data showing that the
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:26.080]   combination with the adoptive transfer of NK cells enhanced the immune response of AFM13
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:33.520]   leading to prolonged survival in the respective mouse model and as we mentioned the phase 1B
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:43.280]   study and the Anderson is now in the last stages of preparation. If we go to slide six you see
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:51.600]   that in our pre-clinical studies with AFM24 we saw potent killing of EGFR positive tumor cell lines
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:15:00.720]   mediated by two distinctive mechanisms of action. Potent ADCC or antibody dependent cellular
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   cytotoxicity is seen irrespective of the mutational status of the tumor cells
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   and we see potent killing mediated by ADCP or antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:23.760]   in tumor cells with high and low EGFR expression importantly in cells bearing the KRAS
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:33.520]   G13D mutation AFM24 shows preserved killing potent killing or ADCP or phagocytosis
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:41.600]   whereas this ability is lost for established treatments for the anti BCMA
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:52.640]   CD16 or RO729 formally known as AFM26 molecule we also saw very good potency in synomunkies
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.400]   whereas a dose dependent killing of BCMA positive plasma cells
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:08.000]   that was observed we believe that the observed improved potency is mediated by the dual mode
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.120]   of action of our approach the innate cell engagers are employing NK cells and macrophages
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:22.880]   to kill tumor cells and thus act via a two pronged mode of action of antibody dependent
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:30.240]   cellular cytotoxicity and antibody dependent phagocytosis to fight cancer indeed the
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.600]   dual mode of action is differentiated from other innate cell targeted approaches
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:45.840]   as these specifically activate NK cells only our innate cell engagers work at low expression
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:54.080]   levels the potency is thus independent of the surface target expression and you see this
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:01.920]   we continue in slide six with AFM13 we learned that there is a broad range of cell lines that
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.400]   express different levels of tumor antigen and we have not observed any dependency of target
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:16.800]   expression to the potency of the molecule the same holds true for AFM24 and the anti BCMA
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:24.320]   engager is pre clinically both molecules have shown high potency across a wide range of EGFR
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:32.480]   and BCMA surface expression including at low target expression levels this implies
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.800]   that more patients could respond to treatment with an innate cell engager versus an antibody
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:48.000]   drug conjugate or ADC as the max mechanism of ADCs have been shown only to rely on certain
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.560]   levels of target antigen thereby missing those tumor cells with expression levels below the
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:05.040]   ability of the ADC to bind two target cells as we move on to slide seven and report on the safety
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:13.440]   front pre clinically our innate cell engagers demonstrate low cytokine release some examples
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:19.680]   of this are the iodine enabling toxicology study the synomologous monkeys which consistently
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:28.160]   showed no meaningful increases in serum cytokines for example at the June virtual ACR conference
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:35.440]   a preclinical poster presentation on the RO729 molecule the genetic showed potent cell killing
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:42.000]   in tumor cell lines employing NK cells as effector cells with minimal increase in cytokines
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.680]   also a four week safety study in synomonkeys showed a favorable safety profile with no
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:58.160]   cytokine release or adverse findings at the 1515 and 50 so five zero mixed per kick tested dose
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:07.520]   levels and in the case of AFN24 only a transient increase in RO6 was observed that was fully
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:15.280]   reversible within 24 hours but no signs of cytokine release was observed that would lead one to
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:22.960]   believe that there is a risk of a cytokine storm in patients important to note here is that none
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:29.760]   of the clinical studies of AFN13 have revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:39.440]   these data indicate that our ICs have a tolerable and good safety profile taken altogether these
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:46.000]   data suggest that our innate cell engages are potent able to engage at low levels of antigen
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:54.960]   expression and have thus far demonstrated a good and tolerable safety profile now in order to maximize
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:01.200]   the opportunity for molecules in addition to clinical development as monotherapies we're
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.720]   also pursuing combinations with natural killer cells and other treatments such as checkpoint
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:16.240]   inhibitors such as PD1 and PD1 we go to slide 8 and first let me comment on our combination approach
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:23.200]   with NK cells as you see on the slide there is evidence showing that high NK cell numbers
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:30.000]   are associated with better outcomes for example patients with metastatic coutaneous melanoma
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:37.120]   have improved survival rates if their tumors show evidence of NK cell infiltration
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:43.040]   we also know that patients with diffuse large B cell and follicular lymphomas
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:53.120]   treated with NDCD20 antibodies that have low peripheral NK counts tend to have poor survival
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:01.120]   we're seeing that one of the limitations in treating patients is that they don't have the
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:10.240]   appropriate amount of NK cells so we're working on supplementing NK cells through adaptive transfer
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:16.320]   and are currently assessing different approaches as you can see on slide 9
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:25.600]   as we go to slide 10 and as discussed earlier the improved tumor cell killing by loading
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:33.440]   NK cells with our ICEs as you see on the graph for in vitro data on the right hand side of slide 10
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:41.280]   it will be investigated in the MD Anderson phase one study in CD30 positive recurrent or refractor
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:48.160]   Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients the preclinical data that we share here and have
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.560]   shared before leads us to believe that we can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:00.800]   of innate cell engager AFM 13 through the addition of NK cells
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:10.160]   and encouraged by the synergistic potential of combining our ICEs with NK cells
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.360]   and checkpoint inhibitors we're currently evaluating the opportunity on our developing
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:24.480]   clinical plans for these combinations with AFM 24 finally let me just briefly summarize the recent
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:32.960]   posters presented at ACR as a reminder our AFM 24 poster demonstrated its distinct mechanism of action
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:41.680]   different from other EGFR signaling inhibition approaches potentially able to provide
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:48.400]   benefit to a broad range of cancer patients and in the case of the joint poster with genetic
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:56.640]   the preclinical pharmacology and safety of the BCMA CD60NA innate cell engager shows potent
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.040]   cell killing in tumor cell lines employing NK cells as effector cells minimal increase
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:10.800]   in cytokines suggesting a low risk of cytokine release syndrome we hope this background was
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:17.760]   helpful for you and I will now turn the call over to Angus to introduce himself and provide an
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:25.360]   update on the financials thanks thank you arse thank you arse before i discuss our financial
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:33.280]   highlights let me just say that I am thrilled and I look forward to working with our community
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:39.440]   deliver on the problems of our exciting cytokines turning to the results for the quarter
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.800]   api med consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:52.880]   as issued by the international accounting standard board for IASB the consolidated financial statements
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.640]   are presented in euros which is the company's functional and presentation currency therefore
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:04.960]   all financial numbers that I will present in this call unless otherwise noted will be in euros
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:12.720]   we ended the second quarter with cash cash equivalents and current financial assets of 92.6
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:21.600]   million euros compared to 104.1 million euros on December 31st 2019 during the quarter we received
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.280]   net proceeds of approximately 20.8 million euros under our asset market for ATM program
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   based on our current operating plan and assumptions we anticipate that our cash
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:39.920]   cash equivalents and current financial assets will support operations into the first half of 2022
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:46.320]   net cash used in operating activities for the quarter ended June 30th 2020
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:53.760]   was 15 million euros compared to 5.6 million euros in the second quarter of 2019 the second quarter
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.280]   2019 net cash use and operating activities included a milestone payment to the company
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:07.120]   from the Genentech collaboration total revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was 2.9 million euros
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:14.320]   compared with 4 million euros in the second quarter of 2019 revenue in 2020 and 2019 predominantly
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.600]   relates to the Genentech collaboration revenue from the Genentech collaboration in the second quarter
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.440]   2020 was comprised of revenue recognized for collaborative research services performed during
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:33.520]   the quarter r&d expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 11.7 million euros compared to 11.5
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:40.000]   million euros in the second quarter of 2019 expenses in 2020 relate predominantly to our AFM
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.240]   13 and AFM 24 clinical programs as well as to our early stage development and discovery activities
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:54.160]   GNA expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were 2.6 million euros compared to 2.3 million euros
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:01.120]   in the second quarter of 2019 the increase is primarily related to higher SOCs compliance costs
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:07.840]   legal consulting and audit costs net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was 12.2 million euros
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:15.520]   or 16 cents per common share of 10.3 million euros or 17 cents per common share during the
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:21.280]   second quarter of 2019 the weighted number of common shares outstanding for the quarter ended
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:28.000]   June 30th 2020 for 79.2 million I will now turn the call back to Adi Adi
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:39.280]   Thank you Angus as you can see from our presentation today we're taking advantage of the knowledge
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:46.800]   that we've gained in the field of innate immunity and are applying it to our programs going forward
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:53.600]   this experience in working with the innate immune system is something that we have uniquely
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:27:00.800]   established at AFMET and is helping us in guiding the design of unique therapies which
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:08.320]   now have the potential to address very different kinds of cancers I just want to point out here
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:16.720]   that the EGFR is expressed in more than 10 tumors and that gives us a lot of optionality
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:25.280]   how to take this molecule forward we're pleased with how things are moving forward for both our
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:32.240]   clinical and preclinical programs especially in the current environment our preclinical programs
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:39.840]   are in track AFM 13 and 24 are moving forward according to plan and genetic is moving things
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:48.080]   forward with the anti-PCMA CG168 inertial engage what are our inflection points for the next
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:56.640]   one and a half years for AFM 13 we've mentioned that we want to present the interim data in peripheral
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:06.320]   T cell lymphoma around middle of next year we've been successful in our collaboration
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:14.000]   with MD Anderson moving forward the combination of AFM 13 and co-plug derived natural killer cells
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.120]   as we said we're ready to start our MD Anderson is ready to start and we hope to report first
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:29.520]   patient then and we will provide updates as we move forward for AFM 24 we're in the midst of
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:37.520]   dose escalation in order to generate safety and activity data this is quite exciting for us because
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:46.080]   it's a drug with a very differentiator profile as profile as compared to the other moieties currently
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:53.920]   used in targeting EGFR receptor now with the dose escalation and establishing the safety
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.840]   we obviously will have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.960]   dose cohort expansion but as we've mentioned earlier is also planning early on to move forward
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:13.920]   into combinations we're very happy with the progress in the genetic collaboration
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:20.800]   we've just provided the next update for the PCMA CG168 engage we have multiple other programs
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:28.160]   ongoing and if things go well pending on program progression we can bring in additional milestone
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:38.960]   and for our newest additions to the pipeline with AFM 28 and AFM 32 we are starting behind
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:47.440]   enabling studies so that we can have an ID filing first for AFM 28 finally before we open the session
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:54.240]   for Q&A I would like to thank all our employees for their contribution and express our gratitude
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:00.320]   my gratitude in particular for our investigators and the clinical sites the patients and and all
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:06.560]   their families and our investors who are supporting us in our efforts to develop these innovative
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:13.920]   treatments for cancer patients it is through the combined efforts of all of you that keeps us
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:21.200]   on the path of discovery and innovation I'm now happy to close the presentation and we're open now
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:28.000]   for questions thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.480]   as a reminder should you wish to ask a question you will be depressed far and the number one
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.120]   in the telephone ring for me to be announced if you wish to cancel it and depress the pound or
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:43.600]   hash key once again it's far and one for questions first question comes from the line
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:51.600]   from Ali Rakoff from Jeffery please go ahead here line is now open hi good morning everyone
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:58.880]   uh that's under progress and thanks for taking my questions um to start off just wondering for AFM 24
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.440]   I'm not sure how much you can say on this but just wondering if both patients in core
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:11.200]   two have been dosed and um if you can talk more uh about the the timing of dosing between patients
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.600]   and what the foresight's activated can you provide any more perspective about enrollment
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:23.360]   pace going forward Andreas can you take the question please yeah so there were multiple parts of the
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:32.400]   questions I hope I got them all um so the phase one study of AFM 24 um as we said we are recruiting
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:40.720]   in the second cohort um we have not yet disclosed how many patients um as you know it's a standard
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:49.360]   three by three design um with with a Bayesian uh dose modification uh but but that's basically
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:56.240]   what it is um in terms of timing between the patients there is a mandatory eight day waiting
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:03.120]   period uh between patients uh so they cannot be treated all at the same time but will be staggered
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:11.520]   with eight day intervals and there was another part of the question around the four participating
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.320]   sites right yeah I'm just wondering if you can provide any more perspective about uh enrollment
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:26.560]   pace going forward yeah currently the enrollment uh pace is uh as pre-spressified by the protocol so
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:32.960]   all sites are very active in screening patients and as we said all patients all sites have already
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:43.680]   contributed patients got it okay great and then also for AFM 24 um just checking if you can say
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.200]   more about the the tumor types that you're screening for the study and if you can also provide more
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:58.720]   perspective into the the checkpoint inhibitor and combo plans at this point um so for the uh tumor
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:08.560]   types um in the dose escalation part uh we are accepting all our patients with or all histologies
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:15.360]   that our ejfr expressing and uh whereas the patient has exhausted the respective standard
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:23.120]   of care treatments as adi mentioned this is a wide variety of potential tumors are probably the two
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.800]   most prevalent tumors would be colorectal cancer and non small cell lung cancer and
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:35.680]   these are the two histologies where we would expect probably the majority of patients in the phase
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:44.160]   one having said that the dose escalation part would but also be be open for other ejfr expressing
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:52.240]   tumors like for example head and neck cancer gastric cancer or other solid tumors now once we
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:58.640]   have defined our dose limiting toxicities or if there are no dose limiting toxicities we
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:05.920]   have defined the recommended phase two dose uh we will enroll into uh tumor specific expansion
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:12.160]   cohorts um and these expansion cohorts are currently in the process of being defined
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:22.720]   now for our pd1 combination plans um based on the interesting data we have seen with pd1 in
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:30.240]   combination with afm 13 which aren't referred to uh was a very encouraging complete response
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:38.480]   rate in excess of 40 percent uh we plan to have a combination with a pd1 or pdl1 inhibitor
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:48.160]   open rather soon probably uh in parallel to the last cohorts of the dose escalation of the single
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.520]   agent study so it will be more or less a parallel development that we are anticipating right now
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.120]   great okay thanks for the additional perspective
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:08.800]   any follow-up questions sorry
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:18.320]   okay we'll now proceed to the next question the next question comes from the line of uh jim
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.040]   britching off from los fargo please go ahead jim
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:28.480]   yeah hi guys like congrats on all the progress um maybe just a first quick question for angus
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:34.960]   to start him off um collaborative research revenues is that expected to be a stable number
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.000]   between the you know three to four million dollar level or is there any reason that might
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.880]   go up as as programs progress and as we think about the milestone that got paid in the third quarter
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.840]   is it a simple matter to back out the assumptions around collaborative research revenues and
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   that will give us some sense of the milestone i'll give me that you can't say it explicitly
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.720]   yeah yeah thanks jim for the question so um you know our our revenue numbers fluctuate from
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.320]   quarter to quarter you know based primarily on the number of hours that we're that we're
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:12.800]   working on um the various genentech programs um that are in progress um i mean you can see just
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.080]   looking back at the last several quarters we've been you know fairly fairly range range bound
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.440]   and call it the two million to five million zone um you know when you see increases it's typically
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:29.120]   a result of quant and time milestone payments that we receive so um you know this this milestone
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:35.520]   payment um that we discussed today um that we'll that we'll get in the third quarter um we'll we'll
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:40.240]   likely increase our revenues in the third quarter and that would be sort of an add-on to the to the
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.200]   range you've seen over the last several quarters have met again kind of to the uh two to five million
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:52.000]   dollars two to five million euros rather got it okay that's that's helpful and then maybe just on um
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:59.840]   cohort one for AFM 24 and what we might learn from that cohort um can you remind us if you're
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:05.760]   doing pre and post biopsies and what kind of translational work you might be doing and you
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:11.200]   know how that might inform you know the ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:22.800]   yeah um so in the uh dose escalation part um we do a pre treatment biopsy uh post or on treatment
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:30.640]   biopsies are optional we do have a significant correlative science program looking at uh
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:38.560]   peripheral activation markers of nk cells as well as on cytokine profiles uh once we are in the
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   expansion phase so we are recruiting into tumor specific cohorts i think this is the part where
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.360]   we will get most of the correlative science as we have a more homogeneous patient population
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:38:00.560]   we maintain our requirement for a pre treatment biopsy and will have post or on treatment biopsies
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:09.920]   in selected cohorts and then just you know um given the comments on the variability and peripheral
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:20.000]   nk cell populations um is there any sense in screening patients for their nk cell levels
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:27.280]   given that you know patients who screen low may not have adequate nk cells or macrophages to recruit
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:33.920]   or you feel like within the variability of innate cell um in the blood that that you'll be able
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:40.320]   to have an effective treatment and it's not worth screening for that variable uh i think currently
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:47.840]   it would be uh premature to yeah depends on what you mean with screening so we are definitely
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:54.160]   determining the uh levels of circulating nk cells and also looking at some of their characteristics
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   i think we currently do not have enough data to define a cutoff or a threshold and this may very
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:12.000]   well vary between uh tumor histologies and also be dependent on uh the infiltration of nk cells
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   in the tumor microenvironment um variable which we have seen in our afm columbia study
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:27.600]   to have some impact on on the likelihood to respond to patient of patients so think in the beginning
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:35.120]   of the program we will be open for all comers we will assess all of these important biomarkers and
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:41.760]   then based on the activity data and the readouts that we are seeing we may modify as a program
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.240]   defining certain thresholds but currently i think it would be premature to do that
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.440]   and maybe just a final question just um the ambianders in collaboration is focused on
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:40:00.640]   cord blood derived um nk cells is there any thought through other nk cell sources including
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:07.200]   um potentially ip sc derived nk cells um
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:15.760]   adi you want to take this question or should i take it no well i under why don't you go ahead
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:23.600]   okay uh yeah you're right ring cord blood derived nk cells is one source of nk cells and
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:34.320]   if you watch the field of nk cell um based approaches especially the the field around
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:41.920]   companies and institutes are providing different sources of nk cells there is definitely uh
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:49.040]   speed picking up and then there is a variety of options to to look at and this is what we do
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:58.320]   not only from our side but we have also received proactive inquiries of potential
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:06.720]   working models together so we are looking at the entire nk cell field and then evaluate various
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:13.280]   options there great thanks for taking the question guys maybe as a quick comment so we
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:20.160]   see this um uh cord blood derived nk cells already quite advanced in clinical development so they
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:27.040]   have already been uh many patients treated while with the ip sc is currently uh there is still a um
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:34.160]   the safety to be determined and obviously in combination we learn more on their functionalities
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:42.080]   so this is somewhat uh yet uh to us on how functional an itc derived versus a peripheral
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:48.880]   in k cell is and it's good to see the first clinical data so we're quite uh not only happy but we've
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.600]   we've checked so many different options at the moment for nk cells and we're indeed very convinced
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:00.560]   about the activity of the cord blood derived cells from MD Anderson great thanks adi
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:12.000]   thank you our next question comes from the line of ik og from BMO capital the line is now open please
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   go ahead hey good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my question this is ek on for docum
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.280]   i just a couple regarding the dcma and they engage her uh i understand that you have limited
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:35.440]   visibility on the entirety of the clinical bill pathway um but if you can provide any type of
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:44.480]   insight in terms of what genetic uh kind of has planned may in terms of could it potentially pursue
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:55.360]   an accelerated pathway um for the assets and secondly again you you don't provide uh complete
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:00.880]   details on the that milestone payments but if you can provide it some additional perspective on
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:10.720]   what the future milestones uh for that said might hold um in terms of uh you know phase two phase
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.160]   three things of that sort uh should we expect increasing size of value for each milestone
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:23.600]   payments uh that'd be helpful for us thanks adi maybe i take the question on the pathway
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:32.080]   and then hand over to you with the milestones yes please go ahead aunt so yeah thanks for the question
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:38.000]   i mean as you already correctly say we cannot really speak in detail for genetic but we
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.960]   can share with you i think you're aware of course um licensing this molecule was a big part of the
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:52.320]   deal we did with genetic they're obviously excited about the strong differentiation potential
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.840]   off the molecule also demonstrated at acr at the at the poster just to review again
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:04.800]   a very strong uh preclinical cell killing selective nosautica and release very good safety profile
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:13.440]   and good pharmacogenetic marker specific bcma uh plasma cell killing in the sino monkey so you know
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:21.840]   despite the also recent approvals of the you know income first encumbers in the space um
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:29.760]   i would say that genetic shares our excitement with the differentiation potential in a way for a
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:37.280]   potentially best in class molecule maybe i i leave it there i think it's it's a it's a clearly um
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:46.000]   strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule will enable uh genetic and we as
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:54.320]   their partner to you know have a strong position in the space uh yeah regarding the financial
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:01.120]   so i just want to recall the deal uh when it was signed so we received 96 million in upfront cash
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:11.440]   and uh and can get the total of more than five billion in milestones that are in different
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:16.880]   categories so there are a pretty little mark there's a pretty little milestone payment there are
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:23.680]   indeed multiple clinical milestone payments regulatory and sales milestones and on top we
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:31.600]   can receive royalties which as we described are on the higher end of what you would expect for the
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:42.400]   early nature of the uh license agreement uh beyond that we're not able to disclose any further details
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:49.680]   unless genetic would allow us or rush would allow us to do so usually and that's just a
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:56.000]   general statement is that the payments will increase the further the program progresses
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:03.040]   okay thank you for that and just one more quick question i think i might have misheard it and
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:11.280]   this is in regards to AFM 24 i believe you mentioned that there was a patient uh that had increased
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:19.600]   in all six cytokine levels that would resolve over 24 hours i'm just curious was that self-resolving
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:26.880]   or did that patient receive and uh all six inhibitor yeah i can thanks for bringing that up
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:33.520]   and for clarification so the transient our sixth increase was reported in the ionine enabling
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:40.640]   synotox study what you you referred to the acr poster indeed we saw that with the dosing
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:49.600]   a kind of moderate peak that quickly went down was completely resolved without any any treatment
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.600]   obviously you know one doesn't do that in the because this is synotox study and again when we see this
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:00.720]   in the context because of a transient and fully reversed leads us to the conclusion which of
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:08.800]   course will be looked at carefully in patients that we should not expect any kind of cytokine release
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:14.240]   syndrome okay thank you for that clarification sure
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:22.240]   thank you next question comes from the line of gen from made in your company
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:27.520]   please go ahead the line is open
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:35.920]   hello yes hello yes hi can hear you hi uh sorry that's uh my headsets fall out uh thanks for
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:44.080]   taking the questions my first question is that uh for the AFM 13 in the for the registration study
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:55.200]   that the it's assignment two uh set up so uh what might be the threshold of or in the 40 patients
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:01.840]   and sort of internet read out before you can move forward so just curious what any information you
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:12.080]   can reveal on that front um i'm afraid we cannot give um the concrete response rate it's based
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:17.440]   also on a beige in design so there are some independence of response rates but we usually
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:24.960]   do not disclose thresholds but it's a classical assignment two stage design okay no problem
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:35.680]   and also just curious in terms of AFM 24 that uh you are those escalating but at least based on
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:43.840]   the animal data is any thoughts where when you might start to see the potential effective dose
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   to start uh i think currently it's not possible to predict uh when we will have the optimal
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:49:00.640]   biologically active dose um as there are a number of covariance like binding sites for CD 16
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:09.440]   binding sites for egfr and then distribution um and as you know the the animal models especially
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:18.400]   in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are very difficult to translate um the relevant
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:25.120]   talk species and we've started that's only a talk species is the synomorgous monkey however we do
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:33.280]   not have any uh synomorgous monkey tumor models available so we cannot really bridge between
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.920]   what we see in the toxicology studies and then what we would see in terms of efficacy for for tumors
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:45.280]   so it will be something that we will have to define in our in our clinical program
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:55.760]   okay great maybe what sticking one last question here is that uh in terms of adaptive
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:03.840]   incase cell uh from the copula not deriving itself uh it first of all could that be potentially used
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:12.240]   in sort of tumor and any comments comments in terms of uh regarding that uh put possibilities
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:21.600]   uh this is as adi said something that we are actively looking into um we're starting out with
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:32.080]   lymphomas obviously with afm 13 targeting cd 30 but our vision is uh that also for afm 24 we will
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:40.560]   develop certain development options in combination with nk cells uh could be cord blood derived
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:46.560]   nk cells could be nk cells from another source uh that is something that we will define but
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:55.280]   the intention is also to to have a have a program where afm 24 would be partnered with um exogenous
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:02.800]   nk cells okay great thanks uh appreciate it and congrats for another project this far
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.320]   yep no further question at this time for any closing remarks please go out speakers
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:25.200]   yeah thank you again for listening in and following our our updates um the uh the program is coming
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:32.960]   smoothly along despite that we are affected by uh by covid we have strengthened the team significantly
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:39.280]   in order to address any issues that may relate to the conductance of this clinical trials or
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:47.600]   to the uh interactions with the with the specific uh sites so we're very happy to be able to uh
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:54.080]   have been able to address any of the issues that have been arising and I indeed want to thank again
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:52:03.200]   the entire team here at afimet for managing all that through this difficult times we're quite excited
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:11.040]   that we can move forward uh these programs either it's monotherapies and now looking at
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:16.880]   different options of of combination if you've heard we focus on natural killer cells and checkpoint
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:23.520]   inhibitors in particular PD1s or PDO1s so we feel that we have with the multiple programs
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:31.200]   addressing different targets we can provide a cadence of data over the next quarters and
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:37.920]   in years and very happy to report any additional updates as we move along thanks a lot again for
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:46.640]   listening in and uh all the best good boy thank you for participating in the Algonquin Act stay safe
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   everyone thank you

[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.040]   the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.pilgrims.com.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.520]   After today's presentation, there will be the opportunity to ask questions.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.120]   I would now like to turn the conference over to Dana Muinoto, how do you invest relations
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.120]   for pilgrim's pride?
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120]   Please go ahead, sir.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.120]   Good morning and thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.160]   As we review our operating international results for the third quarter ended September 27, 2020.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.920]   Yesterday afternoon we issued a press release providing an overview of our financial performance
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.160]   for the quarter including a reconciliation of any non-gap measures we may discuss.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160]   The copy of the release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.880]   along with the slides we will reference during this call.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.400]   These items have also been filed as aid case and are available online at www.scc.gov.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.080]   Presenting to you today are Fabio Sandri, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.160]   Mental Officer, and Joe Wolbuzer at Gomaddi Risk Management.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.000]   Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to remind everyone of our safe harbor
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   disclaimer.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements that represent our outlook and current
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   expectations as of the day of this release.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320]   Other additional factors non-anticipated by management may cause actual results to differ
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.520]   materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.440]   Very information considering those factors has been provided in today's press release on
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   NK in our regular filings with the SEC.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.800]   I'd now like to turn the call over to Fabio Sandri.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   Thank you Dana.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.440]   Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us today.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.680]   For the third quarter of 2020 we reported net revenues of $3.08 billion and adjusted EBITAS
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.880]   of $305 million or 9.9% margin, 18% higher than a year ago and an adjusted GAP EPS of
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.880]   $0.66.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.680]   I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our global team for their continuing commitment,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.520]   dedication and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and healthy
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.640]   while maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging time.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.840]   I could not be more proud of our team as they have continued to come together to support
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.000]   one another, our customers and consumers.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.520]   Safety is a condition of importance and our team members responded admirably to the unprecedented
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.920]   conditions supplying products to our customers.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.120]   We're continuously adapting our global operations to the change in channel demand while adjusting
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.400]   our operations to be able to maintain the operations at all our plans and minimize any significant
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.320]   disruption due to labor and health issues.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.720]   We remain diligent in implementing precautionary, proactive steps to better safeguard the wellness
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.040]   and help of each team member while fulfilling our facial duty as a food producer to consumers
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.080]   in every region where we operate.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.000]   We encourage direct COVID-19 mitigation costs of roughly $27 million for the quarter and close
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   to $77 million year-to-date.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.120]   The direct costs are related to the extra cleaning of our production and common areas.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.920]   The extra PPE and including masks and face shoes that we are providing to all of our team members
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.200]   and the installation of physical barriers in our production areas.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.720]   We also installed dual technology UV and bipolar ionization in every plant to filter the air
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.760]   and neutralize potential viruses.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.000]   We are offering free light health online services that allow for virtual doctor visits and no
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.040]   cost and above all CDC guidelines.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.560]   We remove vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   outbreaks.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.280]   These figures include indirect costs there are more there are a lot of indirect costs there
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.040]   are more difficult to precisely quantify such as overall disruptions for operations less
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.400]   optimal makes and production efficiencies that are not included in these numbers.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.520]   Also we are supporting our communities with our home strong initiative.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.120]   It is an example of how we value the importance role with playing the communities where our
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.080]   team members live and work.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.360]   We understand the responsibility that comes with being a major employer in rural communities
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.800]   and we work hard to contribute to the well-being of those communities by not only providing
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.920]   gainful employment opportunities but also participating in voluntary donation and sponsorship opportunities.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.520]   This quarter we include $50 million in SGNA for this initiative.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.440]   The specifics of our business despite continuing volatility and challenging marketing environments
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.560]   in Q3 and added operating costs we have continued to generate a superior relative performance
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.120]   to the competition and have remained resilient to market fluctuations.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.760]   This is a reflection of our portfolio approach including the strategy on well-diversified products
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.480]   broad geographical footprints and the relentless focus on key customers.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.600]   For the full quarter operating performance both in US and Mexico significantly improved sequentially
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.080]   and Europe also continued to increase despite the challenges due to COVID-19.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.160]   In Q3 we saw market conditions continue to recover across all of our global operations
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.840]   with US and particularly Mexico experiencing the struggle rebounds in performance relative
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.680]   to weak conditions during the first half of the year.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.120]   We are pleased with the results especially when taking into account all the disruptions less
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.080]   than optimal product mix and added operating costs when compared to the environment in 2019.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.480]   Despite continuing challenges in global market conditions due to COVID-19 our consolidated
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.040]   results have also remained well balanced and the result of our vision to become the best
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.840]   and most respected company creating the opportunity for a better future for our team members.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.040]   To support our vision we are continuing to implement our strategy of developing a unique
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.840]   portfolio diverse complementary business models, continue to relentless pursue operational
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.960]   excellence becoming a more valid partner with key customers and creating an informed environment
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.600]   for safe people safe products and healthy attitudes.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.720]   While market conditions in all our global operations are continue to improve during the quarter
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.800]   food service demand globally still has not reached prior levels and the environments
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.720]   are still quite challenging some sectors where we operate disruptions from COVID-19 have continued
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.800]   to present a significant challenge on each individual country's demand for protein consumption
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   as well as for the flow of global trades and generate volatility far beyond normal seasonal
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   factors.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.360]   We will maintain our strategy while continue to improve the portfolio to better respond
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.160]   to individual market dynamics and generate a relative increase in performance over our
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   peers.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.480]   We believe this approach will give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.720]   long run and minimize the full peaks and troughs of the commodity sectors.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.480]   During the third quarter in the U.S. we are continuing to see the main recovery at our
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:43.100]   fresh operations including from some sectors within food service with more space gradually
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:49.320]   losing travel and movement restrictions QSL volume has been especially strong and demand
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.440]   from our customers has been outperforming the industry similar to last quarter commodity
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.560]   large bird reboning was also again the most challenge during Q3 operationally however
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.800]   we continue to improve our relative performance versus the industry across all business units.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.240]   We are continuing to adapt to the shipping channel demand by increasing our volume mix
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.240]   to key customer retailers.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:19.200]   In addition a large portion of our food service customers are also within the QSR segment which
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.720]   has further dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.960]   Our portfolio of differentiated products along with our key customer model are giving us
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.280]   better installation against the volatility.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.440]   We're also much better positioned to adjust products and channel mix even our presence
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.800]   across all bird sizes from small to large.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.320]   Within those small birds and case ready segments market supply and demand was again very well
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.080]   balanced during Q3 demand from retailers especially from our key customers was strong supporting
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.040]   improving performance of our case ready business.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.440]   Our market leadership in these categories and more differentiated product portfolio have
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.840]   continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive adventure versus the industry.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.920]   While we commit meant to our key customer strategy has been reflected in the consistency
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.460]   for past results.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.480]   The value of this approach has never been more relevant to our growth than during the current
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.440]   times of great uncertainties and challenges.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.240]   To further support the growth of key customers we are doubling our case ready capacity at our
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.320]   plant in Minnesota by increasing the number of heads processed at the plant while also
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.400]   raising the mix of more stable margin case ready products.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.360]   With this addition we also expect to increase by 20% our production of our differentiated
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.080]   higher attributes just bear brand products.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.520]   It is also supporting our conversion of one plant from the commoditized large bird deboning
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.800]   to a key customer QSR in the small bird segment.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.080]   The strong relationships we have with key customers are giving us many opportunities to sustain
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.480]   our volume increase since these customer rely on us to satisfy their needs for growth.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.920]   In addition many of our key customers maintain a leadership position in their respective
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   categories.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.640]   As a result we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.840]   Beyond driving peer growth our key customer strategy also promotes trust, enhances long
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.800]   term relationships and strengthens our margin structure.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.960]   In the US prepare foods business revenue declined 23% on 26% less volume year over year.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:32.640]   A large part of this decrease 70% of the volume was driven by schools remaining closed partially
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.320]   offset by strength in the retail demand.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.280]   On the other hand our margin from sales has improved 29% driven by more favorable price
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   and mix.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:48.240]   We continue to simplify our portfolio to improve efficiencies and shift resources towards branded
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.560]   growth in the retail channel.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.600]   Our pilgrims brand sales grew 52% in our just bear brand gain and new distribution resulting
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.360]   in dollar share growth in the retail channel.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.360]   Relative code storage data at the end of August brawler inventory was up 2% from the close
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.700]   of Q2 but down 1% from the previous year.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.520]   Lack quarter inventories were up 10% compared to last year.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.960]   This is not surprising considering the mixed simplification doing two ongoing labor constraints
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.240]   seen during Q3 and overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result of COVID-19.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.800]   As some markets reopened and the pipelines are empty we are seeing some increasing lack
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.640]   quarter sales during October and our reduction in inventories and upward movement in prices.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:43.120]   US poultry exports including pause were up 4.7% year over year throughout August.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.920]   Brawler meet alone was up 3%.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:53.680]   In contrast through Q3 our exports have increased by 14% year over year outpace in the market.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.760]   China continues to be a significant growth driver and we believe the impact of ASS in South East
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.560]   Asia and now Germany can provide further support to export demand.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.580]   As we approach the one year anniversary of China reopening to US poultry, producers are presented
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.360]   with a vastly different market landscape than a year ago.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.600]   China has solidified itself as one of the largest export destinations for poultry second only
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   to Mexico.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.200]   China's present as a significant buyer keeps diversification of our export portfolio a
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.760]   high priority.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:33.280]   We have added 95 new direct clients in 2020 and have also continued to diversify our product
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.280]   and destination mix.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.080]   Sales of non-traditional export items are up 30% year over year which strengthens the cutout
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.320]   margin.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   We enter Q4 with optimates as we continue to place commodity items efficiently, leverage
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.680]   buildings overall portfolio diversity and prioritize exceptional customer service to meet the needs
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.480]   of our key customers around the world.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.280]   After a very challenging first half in 2020, our Mexican operations delivered great results
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:07.120]   in Q3 and we recorded one of the strongest Q3 in the company's history, despite the favorable
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:13.120]   mix impacted and added operation costs relative to the same period last year.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:19.360]   More normalized economic activities and improved supply demand balance in the market are increased
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.860]   share of non commodity products and are very good operational performance all contribute
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.860]   to the results.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.440]   Although overall demand is improving, we remain agile and are continuing to adapt our facilities
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.720]   by shifting production to those channels that are experienced better relative demand.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.640]   Departments in Mexico explained some challenges, especially in the value categories due to
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.680]   less traffic on retail combined with a contraction in the QSR volume, but we began to see some
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.800]   signs of improvements towards the end of the quarter and we believe the positive trend
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.200]   can be sustained into Q4.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.280]   We remain committed in low-term growth and demand prospects in Mexico, we are continuing
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.960]   to invest in our DEA and premium filters brand both in fresh and in prepared as well as seeing
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:09.720]   more market share in the modern channel which will bring more stable margins to our operations.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.880]   Our European chicken operations delivered a new bit in Q3 that was 13 percent sequentially
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:21.520]   above Q2 with both volumes and revenue 7 percent and 18 percent higher respectively supported
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.320]   by our exposure to retail and continues to be covering food service and QSR demand in
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   particular.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:33.740]   Relative to Q3 of 2019, EBITS was still higher 2 percent despite 8 percent lower volume and
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.320]   5 percent lower revenue.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:41.800]   In the evening of COVID-19 restrictions, the introduction of UK government incentive directs
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.120]   towards food service as well as a consistent improvement in food service demand within
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.600]   continental Europe have all contributed to a better sequentially improved performance
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:56.280]   versus the prior quarter but still have not yet reached prior levels.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.460]   Even during this challenging time, we continue to be relentless in investing in innovation
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:06.240]   delivering labor and new improvements, driving better efficiencies, managing our cost base
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.500]   and offsetting cost increases to lead manufacturing techniques and capital investments around automation
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.780]   and process flow without sacrificing the health and well-being of our team members which remains
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.780]   a priority.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.280]   We are committed to delivering the safest work environment possible improving the quality
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:28.680]   of our products while achieving our sustainability agenda and bird welfare targets.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.440]   Our relative performance to the industry measure as the result of the last 12 months continues
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.520]   to show us improving and increasing the average of the competition in Europe.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:43.360]   For the next quarter we expect further improvements coming from the food service and QSR segments
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.360]   as these segments adapt to the situation in each country and we remain vigilant and prepared
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.480]   to react and adapt in case market conditions change.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.400]   The performance of our newly acquired European pork operations has continued to improve with
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.000]   EBITDA on an upward momentum.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.920]   We have now been profitable on an EBITDA basis for the last six quarters in a row with margins
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.360]   also increasing on a consistent basis.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.040]   The improvement in performance was driven by robust demand at retail partially offset
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.160]   by reduction in food service.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.220]   Continuous strengthening pork exports especially to China as well as the implementation of operation
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.960]   improvements and capture of synergies.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.080]   Exports to China remain strong in Europe 100% in Q3.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   Also export to China have doubled the percentage of our total pork sales and we expect demands
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.840]   from China continue to drive and strengthen our fall overall exports in the near future.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.960]   All of our European fresh pork facilities are approved to export from China so we are
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.840]   well positioned to benefit from those opportunities.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:50.080]   We also continue to evolve in our strategy and we will significantly increase our volumes with
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.000]   a new key customer in the next quarters.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.080]   Integration of the assets is on track to expectations.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:03.000]   Over the next few years we expect to generate an EBITDA improvement to achieve a level that
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.640]   is competitive with leading companies with similar portfolio.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.320]   We have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired European assets through
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.880]   some recent wins to increase our retail exposure and strengthen our partnership with key customers.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.800]   We are optimistic about building upon our operation improvements by continuing to optimize
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.720]   our manufacturing footprint, extract best-in-class operational excellence, capitalize export
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:34.120]   improvements, optimize the portfolio of channels, segments and products as well as strengthening
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.000]   our growth business with key customers to drive innovation in value added and higher margin
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   errors.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.800]   We have a great team in Europe dedicated to generating the best possible relative results
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:50.860]   by focusing on factors within our control while ensuring and protecting the safety and health
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.600]   of our team members.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:58.840]   Port prices has been rising since August driven higher by a combination of stronger than expected
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.880]   export demand and smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the US.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:11.040]   USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 2.17 billion bushels versus 1.99 billion
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.360]   last year which includes a 550 million bushels increase in export demand.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:22.640]   The current corn crop is projected at 14.7 billion bushels, the highest in four years
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.160]   and over 1 billion bushels larger than last year.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.120]   Although corn prices have risen from the lows we saw in August prices are very similar to
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.220]   where they were this time last year.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:40.760]   Soybean yield prices have also risen since August driven higher by larger than expected
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.320]   export demand primarily to China.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.120]   USDA is projecting the current soybean crop at 4.3 billion bushels up over 700 million
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120]   from last year.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:55.840]   Despite the large increase in production, USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 290
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.960]   million bushels, the lowest level in four years.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.920]   The uncertainty over the size of the Chinese import program is causing increasing uncertainty
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.920]   and volatility in the oil seeds market globally.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:12.280]   Wheat prices in Europe has also risen recently despite the larger than expected Russian wheat
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:17.800]   crop and projected increased supply in other major wheat exporters like Australia.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.760]   A slow start to the planting season in Russia and larger than expected export demand out
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.320]   of the US are contributing to the rise prices in the wheat market.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.560]   In the chicken production according to the USDA, Q3 was down half of a percent relative
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.040]   to Q3 2019 as increased live weights did not offset head count reductions.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.280]   The industry continues to maintain a larger layer flock with current levels 4.4 percent above
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.240]   last year in line with the trends observed in QLXC.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.520]   The industry has also managed to reduce the average age of laying hands promoting a younger
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.440]   more efficient breedings.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.080]   This has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to manage supply of eggs in the short term
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.440]   while enabling growth in the long term as the demand environment improves.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:09.160]   Overall the trend has shown a slowing of bullet placement growth which is in line with expectations
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:15.320]   given that most of the bullet placement increases into 2019 and early to 2020 were expected to
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:20.200]   be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:26.880]   From Q2 to Q3 COVID-19 related restrictions have slowly been rolled back with many businesses
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:33.440]   and restaurants opening under modified environments to protect workers and consumer health.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.120]   Throughout this process consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal and have
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.320]   continued to modify their shopping and spending habits in response to the new normal environment.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.160]   This new consumer environment favors the retail channel as many consumers are still required
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.200]   to work from home and choosing to limit exposure to potentially more crowded areas.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.520]   As a result retail demands for chickens like that of all proteins have remained supported
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.520]   throughout the quarter.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.600]   While food theft demands to trail below years ago level this channel has proven highly adaptable
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:11.440]   and continues to improve each month from the low points in April led by the QSR segment.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:18.360]   Entering Q4 the USDA expects production to be flat for the quarter on a year over year
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:26.040]   basis before entering 2021 in which the USDA expects oil production to grow 0.9% versus
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   2020.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:33.000]   High unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute to a food microenvironment and the fallout
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.200]   effects of COVID-19 will impact the channels differently.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.480]   To expect the restriction of restaurant capacities, social distancing guidelines, consumer concern
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.340]   for individual health and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:53.000]   to continue favor favoring the increased frequency of at home meals.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.880]   Since chicken continues to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins retail demand
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.840]   is likely to remain above year ago levels.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.560]   We expect overall food sales demand to remain more volatile and remain below year ago levels
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.320]   at least in the near term.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.200]   QSR's ability to adapt quickly to the new environment in a positive sign for the chicken industry
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.040]   moving from late 2020 to 2021.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.080]   Our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions while
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.680]   minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.580]   While we are already well balanced in terms of our birth size exposure, we will remain
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.900]   diligent in seeking opportunities to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:44.000]   portion of our portfolio by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.880]   while optimizing our existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.200]   Our key customer approach is strategic and creates a basis for further accelerate growth
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   in important categories by promoting more customized, high quality, innovative products to give us
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:06.240]   a clear, long term, sustained competitive advantage while further improving the resilience to market
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240]   filtration.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.520]   With that, let's turn to additional details to our financials.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.320]   IRF/GMA in the third quarter was hired versus AERGO as we improved the efficiencies of our
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.500]   expenses but increased support for expanding the JustBear brand nationally and the investment
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.360]   for our new prepared foods products, both in the US and Mexico, as well as the inclusion
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.520]   of the new assets in Europe.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.720]   Also included in the reported SGNA is our $50 million contribution to the hometown strong
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.240]   initiative and the DOJ agreement.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:42.200]   We will continue to prioritize our capital spending plan this year to optimize our product mix
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:47.480]   that is aimed at improving our ability to supply innovative, less monetized products and strengthening
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.880]   partnerships with key customers.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:55.840]   Even during these uncertainty times, while we continue to evaluate all CAPEX projects and
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.240]   defer those we deem known essential, we reiterate our commitment to investing on strong return
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.080]   on capital employee projects that will improve our operational efficiencies and tailor customer
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.320]   needs to further solidify competitive advantage for customers.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.840]   Our balance sheets continue to be robust given our relentless emphasis on cash flows from
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.640]   operating activities, focus on management of working capital and discipline investment in
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.640]   high return products.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:27.400]   Our liquidity position remains very strong with more than $1.3 billion in total cash unavailability.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:33.780]   We have no short term immediate cash requirements without bonds maturing in 2025 and 2027 and
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.320]   our turnover maturing in 2023.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:42.620]   During the quarter our net debt was $1.9 billion, the lowest since 2016 and a leverage ratio
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.520]   for 2.5 times less well monthly debt.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.960]   Our leverage remains at a manageable level and we expect to continue to produce positive
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.920]   cash flows this year, increasing our financial capability to pursue strategic actions.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:02.160]   We expect 2020 interest expense of around $130 to $140 million.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.520]   We have a strong balance sheet and a leverage that is within our target, which are supportive
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.120]   for us to act on great opportunities during these uncertain times.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:15.160]   We'll remain focused on exercising great care and ensuring that we create shareholder value
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:20.120]   by optimizing our capital structure while preserving the flexibility to pursue a growth strategy.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.080]   And we continue to consider and evaluate all relevant capital allocation strategies that
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:30.120]   will match the pursuit of our growth strategy and continue to review each prospect accordingly
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.800]   to our value creating standards.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.860]   Operator, these conclusions are prepared remarks, please open the call for questions.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.300]   Thank you.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.900]   We will now begin the question and answer session.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:47.920]   In the interest of allowing equal access, we request that you limit your questions to two,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.920]   then rejoin the queue for any follow-up.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.820]   To ask a question, you may press star then one on your fingerprint phone.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.760]   If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.840]   minimize background noise.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.600]   We draw your question, please press star then two.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.880]   At this time we will start moving clearly to assemble our roster.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:17.760]   The question is from Benjamin Toyder with Barclays, please go ahead.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.260]   Hi, good morning, how are you doing?
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.560]   This is Anthony Hernandez on behalf of Ben Toyder.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.240]   My question is regarding COVID-19, how is your current level of absenteeism at plants?
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.520]   How has that evolved in recent weeks considering the continuously high number of cases in the
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.520]   U.S.?
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:45.920]   And also if you can provide some of the kind of a wrong rate of protective measures related
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.720]   to COVID-19 during the quarter and what do you see going forward?
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   Thanks.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   Thank you and good morning.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:59.160]   First, as we face this global coronavirus pandemic, we have been guided by three principles.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.080]   First, an uncompromised commitment to the safety of our team members.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:08.880]   Second, recognizing and embracing our responsibility to provide quality food for the country and
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.840]   of course endeavouring to provide continuing employment opportunities and benefits to our
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.440]   team members during a time of unprecedented economic appeal.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.360]   So the direct costs that we are related to the extra cleaning in our production in common
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.440]   areas.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.820]   We also provide the PPE including the masks and face shoes for all of our team members
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.960]   and we install physical barriers in our production area and of course we are maintaining social
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.000]   distancing whenever, wherever areas we can.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.240]   We do more than 10,000 barriers within the first 30 days of the pandemic and we continue to
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.400]   upgrade those barriers.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:52.960]   We also install the dual technology UV and biconnury ionization in every plant to filter the air
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.040]   and neutralize potential viruses.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:03.160]   As I mentioned, we are offering free live health online services for all of our team members
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:09.920]   that allow for virtual doctor visits at zero cost and above all CDC guidelines we remove
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.880]   the vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.320]   outbreak and that is creating some challenges to our operations because by removing those
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.360]   people we have less people at our plants.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:30.840]   The situation is very fluid, it varies from plant to plant, but over the last months we
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:36.440]   have increased our staffing to close to the levels that we were before COVID.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:44.120]   So we are already running a much better mix that we were during the Q2 and we are seeing
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:49.840]   a very good increase in our absenteeism levels.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.840]   As people are more familiar with what we are doing as we are gaining the trust of the entire
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:05.960]   communities, people are less reluctant to return to work and with that we've been improving
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.400]   our ability to execute the optimal mix.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.160]   Of course we are also working with our key customers to simplify our mix to create a more
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:21.220]   optimal footprint and with the footprint communication with them we are ensuring there are team members,
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:27.400]   we expect to return to the optimal operation in this quarter.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:34.560]   Perfect, thanks so much, I'm going to work on new results.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:41.400]   The next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   Please go ahead.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.680]   Good morning everyone.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.920]   Good morning Ken.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:54.960]   Just two questions, as you change your mix, what was the mix between big, small and medium
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.600]   say last year and then what do you think it's going to be now and then what do you think
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.360]   it's going to be in about a year from now as you adjust your product mixes?
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:11.400]   Can we have a well balance between small birds, treepeck and large birds?
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:18.480]   What we are doing is as the demand has been shifting to more retail, we've been shifting
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.040]   our operations also with the growth of QSR we've also adapted those conditions.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:31.640]   What we are doing for 2021 is to first move that plant from big bird deboning to small
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:36.800]   bird deboning which will increase our presence in that segment.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:46.400]   We are also doubling the capacity in our Minnesota plant to comply or support the growth of our
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.680]   key customers and our Just Fair brand which has doubled the sales in the online channel
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.320]   over this quarter.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:02.200]   Looking into overall portfolio, we moved from 46% of our total sales in retail to around
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:07.560]   51% just in 2020 with small changes in our operation.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:16.440]   For next year expect 2% increase in that portfolio to the retail and 1-2% increase in the small
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.920]   bird with those two conversions.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   Great.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.480]   My next question is can you talk about the sustainability of the Mexican margins?
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.360]   Particularly, I did see that there was a little bit of a FX benefit.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.920]   How do you think about the Mexican operation?
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.640]   I think you did say that it's still continuing the momentum into the fourth quarter and how
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.140]   do you think about it for 2021?
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.360]   How do we frame it in our minds?
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   Yeah, sure.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.920]   We've been talking about Mexico over the last years that they are very volatile quarter
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:55.080]   over quarter but they're more stable if you take a longer period of time or within a year.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:00.400]   What happened in the first quarter or the first semester in Mexico was a complete imbalance
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.660]   during supply and demand.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:07.360]   The industry increased supply during the first semester and at the same time demand because
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.520]   of the COVID-19 really create a challenging environment.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:20.040]   As you remember in Mexico there was no support from the government with the COVID-19 like
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:25.840]   we had in US and Europe, there was no governmental stimulus or unemployment benefits.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:35.480]   We created a sharp slowdown and recession in the region which really affected the demand
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.360]   both in the food service and retail.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:43.840]   While in the US we saw an increasing retail compensating at least partially the shut down
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:49.240]   in food service that didn't happen in Mexico and that's why the supply and demand was completely
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.400]   off balance.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:33:00.680]   As the industry adapted their supply for the Q3 and we adapted to that situation as well,
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.360]   we reduced our costs and we also cut production.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:09.720]   The supply and demand improved a lot and we saw the rebound in the food service and demand
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:16.400]   in Q3 and now we have very stable prices during this time in Mexico.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.040]   We expect this to continue during Q4.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.440]   Q4 has always been a stronger quarter for Mexico with the festivities.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:30.840]   We don't know at which point that will be reduced because of the COVID restrictions.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:37.480]   We've seen some increase in cases in Mexico so there could be some more restrictions in
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:44.180]   the Q4 but given the supply and demand situation that we are right now the results are sustainable.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:52.320]   Now for Q1 we expect the industry to increase production to adequate supply and demand and
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.620]   the return to more normal levels.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:02.660]   Mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again but we expect to be very stable year
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.660]   over year.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.600]   Of course our strategy is supportive of the growth to increase the higher margin differentiated
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.040]   products as well.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:15.240]   We saw a little bit of impact in the prepare foods especially on the more affordable products
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:20.760]   during Q1 but we continue to invest and highly differentiated the pigments products continue
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.920]   to sell really well.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:27.520]   Along the turn despite the volatility Mexico is a growing economy and as the population
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.640]   increase their disposable income it leads to a significant growth in protein consumption.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:39.220]   Great I really appreciate the answer.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.220]   Thank you.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.220]   Thank you.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.860]   The next question is from Ben Bienvenu with Steve Annings.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.860]   Please go ahead.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.860]   Good morning.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.860]   Hi Ben.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:55.420]   I want to ask, you touched on it in your opening comments with ASF in China and Germany.
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.980]   I want to ask on Germany more specifically I think that's a nice boon for the tool of
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:59.980]   business.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.900]   I'm curious on what you're seeing in that business both as it relates to the impact on the domestic
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.420]   market and then an uptick in potential demand from that market as well and how you think
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.140]   your position to capture that benefit.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.420]   Yes thank you Ben.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:19.980]   The operations in Europe are more focused on the retail so we produce most of our products
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:26.020]   in UK for the retail UK market and because of the high welfare we command the premium in
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:34.900]   that region the big competition as you refer is on the food service sector of imported products
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.300]   from Poland and Germany mainly and Spain on the pork side.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:46.100]   As the Germans had these issues with their production and because of the ban in China
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:53.100]   it actually increases the sales in the UK market.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:58.180]   It also creates the opportunity for our UK products to be sold into China.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:05.320]   So what we saw is that on the what we call fifth quarter products a significant increase
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:12.060]   in pricing but on the normal products like loins and others we see the prices more stable
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.740]   because it's a zero sum game at the end of the day.
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:22.140]   So it increases the opportunity to China so that was a welcome I think our sales have
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:27.940]   like we mentioned have double during Q3 and we've seen some very stable pricing but it
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:35.180]   also increases the competition in the food service segments in the UK.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.180]   Okay great.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:41.460]   My second question is related to grain and apologies if I missed this in your opening
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.060]   comment I did hear your overview of the market.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.980]   Could you talk about how your position relative to the market you know are you more hand
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.980]   in mouth at the moment do you have any basis secured any color you could offer there on
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.780]   how your position you know through the balance of fourth quarter and into next year would
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.780]   be helpful.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:03.340]   Hey Ben this is Joe thank you for the question obviously we've seen prices of corn and soybean
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:08.220]   no increase in the last few months which has been the result of a few factors for corn
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.300]   we've seen a reduction from the supply side with USDA reporting 6 million fewer planted
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.540]   acres than they originally estimated back in March.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.620]   To sell our final stocks for 2019 ended up being 200 million bushels less than was expected
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.140]   when the final counting was done.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:27.420]   On the current crop we actually for the acres of the planet see pretty good yields above
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.700]   trend line yields so it's not an issue on the supply side in terms of US production but
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:38.340]   on the demand side we've also seen much bigger exports demand primarily driven by China.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.300]   Still the USDA is projecting a carrier up carryout of around 2.1 billion bushels and that includes
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:49.020]   a 30% increase in export demand from last year so even if export demand ends up higher than
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.060]   what USDA is projecting corn stocks should still be in mind with previous years.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:58.180]   On soybean's USDA is projecting a 290 million bushel carryout which would be the lowest carryout
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.180]   in five years.
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:05.180]   This projection though includes a 31% increase in export demand driven by China in addition
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.580]   to increase export demand Argentina which is one of the world's largest oil seed exporting
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:14.380]   countries is in the midst of a historic economic crisis which is causing farmers there to hold
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:19.260]   back available supplies from the market adding more pressure to the US to meet this demand.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:25.180]   We believe the market is likely to feel anxious about US soybean supplies until there's a resolution
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:29.980]   to this currency situation in Argentina or in South American supplies can be available
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.780]   to meet this demand.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.820]   In terms of how our physicians we've always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:40.900]   to the market conditions and the risks we see and we feel very comfortable with where we are
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.700]   in corn and soy we do recognize the risks of soybean supplies in the US and our positions
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.700]   reflect that.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:50.760]   Okay awesome thanks and best of luck.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.500]   Thank you again.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:39:01.740]   As a reminder if you have a question please press start then 1.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:06.740]   The next question is from Michael Picken with Cleveland Research please go ahead.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:13.340]   Yeah hi good morning I just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of the move
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:19.380]   I guess you know into retail and you know some of that Big Bird product is that being chopped
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.020]   up and put into trays and you know how is that impacting you know some of the margins
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.020]   on the commodity business?
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:34.560]   Yes Mike there's a lot of product from the Big Birds especially during promotional seasonality
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:41.140]   during the summer that from the Big Birds ended up being put in the tray to be sold in the retailers.
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:47.220]   We continue to do that I think the challenge to the industry is that we need to have the
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:52.380]   label available and the facilities available to do more of that and that's why the industry
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:40:01.100]   has not increased more the production to the trade pack as we want or as the demand continues
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.100]   to grow.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.500]   It's also because of that we are increasing the capacity in our Minnesota plant.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:14.340]   So as of today yes we are buying Big Bird meat and we continue to put it on a tray especially
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:19.840]   during Saturdays and I think the whole industry is doing that.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.300]   Okay great and then my second question is you know just looking at the you mentioned that
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.420]   your absentee rates are starting to go down and you're starting to get back to your normal
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.420]   mix.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:36.020]   In terms of some of the deboned dark meat, are you starting to return that to you know historic
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:40.060]   levels and what could that mean for the leg quarter prices which is seeing you know the
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.060]   most pressure?
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.380]   Can that help or is the fact that China is taking more poor?
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:50.460]   Can that help leg quarters or why haven't leg quarter prices moved if there's more deboned
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:55.180]   dark meat potentially being produced and you know it seems like you know at the very least
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.580]   China is taking more US poor.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:05.380]   Yes you're right Mike because of the absentee and also the food service industry in US the
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:13.320]   industry produced 3% more leg quarters in July and August than the same period last year
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:19.540]   despite a lower total production that put a lot of pressure in the leg quarter prices.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:25.520]   As we are seeing more the reopening of the food service and as we are seeing the absentee
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.420]   and the staffing of our clients increasing for us and for the whole industry we are seeing
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.060]   more deboning.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:37.620]   We are already at levels comparable to last year in terms of deboning which will reduce the
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.100]   pressure in the leg quarters.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:46.720]   Of course China has been also more active in the leg quarter market over the last month
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:54.380]   and we're seeing that in the leg quarter inventory that was up on a sequentially basis up to
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:42:00.940]   August but we are seeing a reduction and also the inventory today is down 9% compared to
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:07.220]   the peak Q1 average that we have so those two factors can contribute to the reduction in
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:14.240]   the leg quarter production which is a commodity item as I mentioned and the China interest
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:22.060]   I think we saw over the last weeks although not today the increase in the oil prices and
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:30.540]   the reduction in the dollar which increase the availability of dollars from the developing
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:34.460]   countries which also increases the demand for leg quarters.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:40.140]   So what could help on the leg quarters going forward is both on supply and demand on supply
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:46.420]   is exactly what you said last leg quarters because of the improvement in labor efficiencies
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:51.340]   and the more sales in the domestic market on the food service and on demand because of
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:43:06.900]   low prices and because of more of a low income in the developing economies.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:11.900]   The next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America please go ahead.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:18.980]   Hey you guys good morning thanks for taking the question you know Fabio just as I'm thinking
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:24.340]   about it you know the small bird and retail channels obviously has been tremendously profitable
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:30.140]   for you guys during you know this time period and you know with the plant conversion coming
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:35.140]   but you know with commodity big bird remaining you know in the cutout value you have here remaining
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:41.620]   under such pressure just at what point does it make sense to start talking about converting
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:47.300]   another plant whether that's to retail or to small bird because it just seems like that
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:53.300]   big bird portion is not going to improve without more capacity either being converted or taking
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:57.060]   out of the market you know in some capacity.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:02.860]   Sure thank you Peter I think the decision to convert the plant is a more long term decision
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:08.420]   and we always make those decisions combined with our key customer strategy as we see the
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:15.940]   demand of these key customers growing we take action in our portfolio so and that makes
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:22.180]   a lot of sense for us to do net conversion right now from that from that operation from
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:28.220]   big bird to small bird to support this growth I think again you need to look into a more
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:34.420]   broader long term perspective we continue to expect the food service sector to rebound
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:41.180]   if you look at the food service sector today the food service restaurants are down 13 percent
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:46.300]   year over year and that is impacting the big bird deboning for sure while the key of far
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:54.540]   at 9 percent as we go to a more normal operations as we see maybe the development of vaccines
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:59.380]   we don't know when that's going to happen or we see more openings of the restaurants we
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:07.420]   expect the food service restaurants especially on the full service to regain some market share
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:14.100]   that they're not operating today so I think it's a long term decision and it's also a
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:21.340]   very difficult decision to move from big bird to a smaller because we have the growers and
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:27.900]   we have the feed mills it's all built to that specific bird our plants in the United States
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:35.660]   are really customized to that specific segment so any conversion it really requires significant
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:43.700]   capital and requires some significant changes in the overall supply chain both starting from
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:50.860]   the growers your feed mills and your field operations so it's a high capital investment
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:56.660]   that needs to be supported for the long run so that's why we don't see a lot of conversions
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:46:03.860]   in our industry of course if this situation continues for a longer period of time you
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:10.220]   can see some conversions I think also it's important to know that some other players
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:15.900]   don't have the key customer relationships that we have and moving from the big bird to the
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:24.260]   small bird or to the keys ready require a customer and a key customer to support and they don't
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:32.340]   have those relationships it's harder for them to do some conversions no that's that's helpful
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:38.660]   and then maybe just to follow up you know given where the balance sheet is now and you talked
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:44.940]   about your pair of remarks you know how should we think about M&A potential maybe from a geographic
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:50.100]   perspective or does it make sense to get bigger in pork and in Europe and you know going into
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:57.180]   2021 just any help there and then maybe you can also comment on any updates on your CFO search
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:03.420]   thanks very much sure in terms of strategy I think our strategy continues to save and our
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:07.900]   growth strategy continues intact and as we mentioned have a very strong balance sheet we're looking
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:17.140]   to increasing our preparedness operation and our branded operation to create a more balanced
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:22.940]   portfolio and we're also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more value from
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:30.140]   operational efficiencies we're seeing targets both in the US and outside US geographical
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:36.740]   diversification and to growth in Europe and we will evaluate all alternatives to our value
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:46.260]   creation standards in terms of the CFO we are in the process of finding another CFO we already
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:55.460]   engage recruiting firms and we should have some news in the near future great thanks very much
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:48:06.900]   guys next question is from Adam Sanderson with Goldman Sachsen Co please go ahead yes thank
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:14.500]   you again everyone morning hi so maybe first is the clarification or a little more detail
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:21.660]   on the expansion of the Minnesota plant for case ready and the conversion of the Texas plant
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:29.580]   small bird from Big Bird what's the net impact on your production volume and what's the capital
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:36.580]   cost of those projects yeah in terms of total volume I think we should be just a little
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:44.460]   bit up we expect to be to grow in line with usb expectations and the industry for 2021
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:51.540]   which is a little bit lower than 1% yes as we have more birds in Minnesota but we also
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:57.420]   reduce the weight in our operation on the Big Bird that we are just from into a small bird
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:06.500]   so we expect to be for 2021 in line with those two in terms of investments is not very significant
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:16.020]   to our total capex as the conversion of the small bird plant it's not it's a simple conversion
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:23.020]   of course that qsr requires some DSIs which is portion equipment and some marination equipment
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:29.140]   and we're going to invest in automation in that plant as well today is a manual deboning operation
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:36.260]   and we're going to invest in automated deboning so the investment is close to 20 to 25 million
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:43.220]   dollars in that operation and in the case of case value operation it's close to 70 million
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.700]   dollars so overall it is a total of 100 million dollars that we're going to invest in those
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:55.460]   two conversions okay that's a helpful color and the follow-up was I just want to make sure
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:00.140]   I heard something right from the paragraph remarks it talks about the compared foods business
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:07.100]   in the u.s. declining 26 percent I think is what I heard and maybe hoping to expand on
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:13.940]   that that's the business that I think has had more challenges over the years and just do
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:19.180]   we really just a question of returns of school and food service traffic or how do we think
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:25.900]   about that business or a margin profile moving forward yeah that's exactly it so we in our
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:30.300]   compared food business we have a strong brand which is the pierce brand that is mainly a
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:38.100]   food service brand we also are very strong in the school with our gold case brand both those
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:44.980]   segments are the ones that are most most affected by the COVID-19 the non-commercial food service
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:53.300]   that includes schools were down 66 percent at q2 and now they are down 43 percent we are seeing
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:59.820]   some school reopens which could help but it's the segment that is still down forty percent
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:03.900]   on what we call the commercial food service which is the street business where our pierce
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:14.540]   brand is a leading brand in wings and chunks we saw that at q2 they end up 36 percent lower
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:19.900]   than the prior year but they're rebounding and then today they are close to four percent
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:26.140]   lower than the same period last year so the food service business has been recovering and
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:34.900]   with that our pierce brand has recovered and our volumes but the school system is still
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:41.660]   close to 40 percent lower than the prior year and that's why we're investing in more retail
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:48.660]   branded business as we mentioned our business brand has increased more than 30 percent and
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:53.780]   we have been very successful in spending the just bear brand on the fresh category that
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:52:00.100]   is being very successful on the online segment and also on the on the higher attribute segment
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:08.580]   in our key customers to the pre-pair food segment alright Chris that's the top of color I'll
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:17.300]   pass it on thank you the next question come from Carla Castella with Katie Morgan please
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:25.420]   go ahead hi my questions regarding your leverage the three times target how comfortable or how
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:30.300]   high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional MNA and are you seeing
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:39.620]   any more MNA opportunities just given the volatility and worldwide protein market thank you Carla
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:47.340]   we set this target of two to three times because it's the best capital structure that can protect
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:54.660]   and reduce our interest payments while not creating any any any problem for for our bonds
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:53:01.260]   and for our leverage the two to three times is in normal operations of course during
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:09.260]   some acquisition if we have a great plan on how to reduce that back we can go further I
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:16.580]   don't think there is a number that it's specific or on where we go I think it's more about what
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:23.720]   is the plan to leverage and of course the plan to leverage could include the issue of stock
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.420]   and that's why pilgrims as a public traded company has that opportunity to use the stock
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:34.860]   as a currency not to increase the leverage two points where we don't think it is prudent
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:41.900]   in the case of significant acquisition that will be transformational for the company okay
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:47.220]   and just one last point no in terms sorry in terms of MNA yes we are seeing more targets
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:53.900]   of course the whole situation about traveling has created some challenges in terms of seeing
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:54:01.460]   and visiting assets but we are seeing some targets that are still very interesting to
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:08.840]   us and could create a lot of value for our shareholders okay great and then just in the
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.940]   event that JBS is able to list the U.S. businesses would that cause any need for changing your
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:21.240]   structure yeah we don't believe so I think JBS has said many times that they continue
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:27.260]   to support pilgrims to be public traded company and just as I mentioned it is a great way for
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:33.940]   us to keep our growth we can use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:46.980]   and transformational event for pilgrims okay thank you once again if you have a question
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:55.780]   please press star and one on your telephone gentlemen there are no more questions registered
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:55:00.080]   at this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Fabio Sandri for closing remarks
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:06.480]   well thank you all we would like to reiterate our continued commitment to our valued team

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.580]   >> Welcome to the Eversource Energy Q3 2020 Results Conference Call.
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.060]   My name is John and I'll be over here for today's call.
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.020]   At this time, all participants are on the list in only mode.
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.900]   Later, we will conduct a question and answer session.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.300]   During the question and answer session, if you do have a question press star then one
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.500]   on your touch phone phone.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.260]   Please note that this conference is being recorded.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.680]   And I want to turn the call over to Jeffrey Cotton.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.220]   >> Thank you very much John.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.240]   Good morning and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.100]   I'm Jeff Cotton, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.380]   During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website.
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.220]   And as you can see on slide one, some of the statements made during this investor call may
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.120]   be forward looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.040]   of the U.S. private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.840]   The forward looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.680]   to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.780]   to differ materially for forecast and projections.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.120]   These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.740]   Additional information about the various factors
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.940]   that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10K
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:31.280]   for the year ended December 31, 2019 and our Form 10Q for the three months ended June 30, 2020.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.520]   Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAP measures
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.820]   and how those measures reconcile to GAP results is contained
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.120]   within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10K.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.800]   Seeking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.340]   Also joining us today are Joe Nolan, our Executive Vice President for Strategy, Customer
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.380]   and Corporate Relations, John Marrera, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.260]   and Regulatory and Jay Booth, our Controller.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.640]   Now, I will turn slide two and turn over the call to Phil.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.060]   >> Thank you, Jeff.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.800]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.740]   I hope everyone on the call remains healthy and that these families are safe and doing well.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.060]   This morning, I'll cover a variety of areas, review the results of the third quarter,
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.860]   discuss recent regulatory developments including the acquisition of the assets
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.220]   of Columbia GAS of Massachusetts, provide an update on recent developments
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.700]   around our offshore wind partnership with Orset.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.100]   I'll start with slide two, noting that recurring earnings were $1.02 per share
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.840]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with recurring earnings of $0.98 per share
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.360]   in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.680]   GAP results, which include a charge of $0.01 per share relating
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.720]   to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia GAS of Massachusetts,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.980]   told $1.01 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.180]   In the first nine months of 2020, recurring earnings excluding Columbia GAS acquisition
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:27.580]   costs totaled $2.80 per share compared with recurring earnings of $2.69 per share
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:35.280]   in the first nine months of 2019 and excluding the Northern Path transmission impairment charge.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.500]   GAP results for September of this year were $2.76 per share.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.280]   Turning to our business segments, our electric distribution segment earned $0.60 per share
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.400]   in the third quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.840]   The low earnings were results of both higher storm restoration costs
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.720]   and property tax expense as well as the impact of sub-share dilution.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.360]   Our electric transmission segment earned $0.36 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.700]   with recurring earnings of $0.33 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.460]   Improved results were driven by the continued investment and reliability
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.600]   in our transmission facilities partially offset by shared dilution.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   Our natural gas distribution segment lost $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.920]   with a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of last year.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.780]   Improved results were due to higher revenues.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.840]   I should note that because we didn't close on our acquisition
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.700]   of Columbia GAS of Massachusetts assets until October 9th,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.340]   the transaction had no impact on this gas segment, the segment during the quarter.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.840]   Each quarter this year we booked acquisition related costs at the parent
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.800]   and have segregated them for increased transparency.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.340]   Beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, ongoing results of our new gas franchise
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.880]   which is named Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts will be reflected
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.700]   in the natural gas segment.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.060]   Integration related costs however will continue to be recorded separately
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.100]   at the parent and excluded from our recurring gas earnings.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:45.920]   Our water distribution segment earned $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.580]   with earnings of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.680]   Improved results were due to a $3.5 million after tax gain
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.500]   on the sale of our Henum, Massachusetts area facilities to the town.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:10.460]   Eversource parent earned $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020 excluding the Columbia gas
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.860]   of Massachusetts asset acquisition costs equal to our earnings in the third quarter of last year.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.720]   As you probably noted in our earnings reliefs and can see on slide 3, we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:35.160]   per share guidance of $3.60 to $3.70 and it is excluding the non-recurring costs related
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.500]   to the purchase of Columbia gas of Massachusetts assets.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.600]   We are also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7%
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.040]   from our core regulated business through the year 2024.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.780]   We continue to be, to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range,
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.060]   largely due to the investments we need to make on behalf of our customers
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.980]   as we outlined for you earlier in the year.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.900]   As a reminder, while we fully expect the Columbia gas assets to be accreted
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:17.500]   to our earnings per share starting immediately in 2021, we have not yet updated our long-term financial outlook
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:24.380]   to reflect the acquisition of Columbia gas assets in our capital, our cap backs that are our earnings growth.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:30.820]   In addition, as we disclosed previously, earnings from offshore wind would be incremental
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.140]   to our core business growth.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.860]   We'll provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecast
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.700]   adding in every source gas company in Massachusetts projections
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:50.900]   and provide an update of our offshore wind partnership during our year-end call in late February.
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:57.900]   From the third quarter results, I'll turn to slide 4 and our experience restoring power
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.980]   after tropical storm ETIAS ravaged Connecticut on October 4th.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.860]   We serve 149 cities and towns in Connecticut and every one
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.920]   of these communities suffered damage from ETIAS, much of it catastrophic.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:21.620]   As you can see on the slide, we had nearly 22,000 damaged locations that we had
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.860]   to address and brought in an army of electric restoration
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:32.400]   and tree crews to restore power all the while working on the restoration in a pandemic setting.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.780]   The restoration process lasted nine days, meaning we completed our work one
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.640]   to two days faster than we had in the last two tropical storms that hit Connecticut,
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.700]   even though we had 30 to 35% more damage locations.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:55.440]   And most importantly, we completed that work safely with no serious electrical contact
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.120]   and no COVID exposure among the enormous workforce we brought to Connecticut.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.200]   It's just a tremendous effort by all of our employees
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.800]   from across all parts of every source.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:16.140]   At this time, we estimate that deferred costs across all three states will total more
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:23.180]   than $275 million, with a vast majority of that sum incurred in Connecticut.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:29.060]   That figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:35.680]   We're still actively pursuing invoices from hundreds of vendors that assisted us
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.240]   during the statewide restoration effort.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.820]   Where we were setting new poles or hanging miles of new wires
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:48.000]   or replacing hundreds of transformers, these related costs ought to be capitalized.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.540]   The ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation of performance in faithly
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.120]   and expeditiously restoring power to our customers is pending an ongoing review
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.480]   by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURRA.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:11.060]   That review is scheduled to be completed in late April of 2021.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:19.240]   Sticking with our regulated business, I'll turn to slide five in a review
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.180]   of this year's distribution rate reviews, this past Friday the Massachusetts Department
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:31.860]   of Public Utilities issued its decision in the NSTAR GAS rate review that we filed last year.
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:38.600]   It supports our continued investment in the NSTAR GAS system on behalf of our 300,000 customers.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.740]   The decision allows NSTAR GAS to increase distribution revenues
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.540]   by $23 million on an annualized basis.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:55.200]   The DPU approved an ROE of 9.9% and a capital structure with 54.77% equity.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   It also permits us to implement performance-based rate making for a 10-year term
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:09.820]   that with sounds operating performance by NSTAR GAS will target annual base rate increases
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.200]   of inflation plus 1.03%.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.260]   This is an earnings sharing mechanism that would return 75%
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:24.340]   of the benefit to customers should we see the ROE of 10.9% and sharing mechanism
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.740]   on the downside if our ROE falls below 8.4%.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:34.580]   Also exciting is the decision also approves our first ever geothermal pilot program.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:40.020]   Our other longstanding rate proceeding involves public service of New Hampshire.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.280]   In New Hampshire last month we and all the parties to the PSNH rate case filed a proposed settlement
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.340]   in the rate review that is pending for nearly, you know, a year and a half.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:57.600]   You can see from the slide we settled on a $45 million annualized rate increase
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:05.620]   that includes a 9.3% return on equity and a 54.4% equity layer.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:12.280]   Should regulators approve the settlement the permanent increase would take effect in January,
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.500]   January 1st of 2021.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.980]   You may recall that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission allowed us
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:29.080]   to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately $28 million back in July, July 1st of 2019.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.640]   The final approved rates would be retroactive back to that date, 18 months.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:41.260]   We would-- we cover that in a true up over the course of the year 2021.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.320]   We can settle-- consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:53.060]   to PSNH's first general increase in about a decade and have asked the New Hampshire PUC
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.140]   to approve the settlement before the end of November.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.400]   From the rate review, reviews, I'll turn to slide 6
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.660]   and our recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:12.120]   of Massachusetts for $1.1 billion of cash excluding working capital adjustments.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.280]   Most of these assets were signed to Emerson West Gas Company in Massachusetts,
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.540]   a new subsidiary I mentioned that we formed in May of 2020.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:28.420]   As you can see on the slide, much of Emerson West Gas' service territory is adjacent
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.080]   to end star gas or Yankee gas service territories.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.400]   Additionally, end star electric already provides electric service to about 20
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.160]   of the communities that Emerson West Gas serves with natural gas.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.940]   As a result, we expect to realize operational benefits
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:51.340]   for our newest 330,000 natural gas customers and the communities where they live.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:58.140]   To finance the transaction, we sold approximately $500 million of equity
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:04.420]   in June and we financed the death portion of the transaction in August.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.480]   And again, we are very confident that this transaction will be accretive
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.920]   to our earnings per share in 2021 and incrementally accretive in the years ahead.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   A critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.160]   to all stakeholders is an eight-year rate plan that we negotiated
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.140]   with the Massachusetts Attorney General and other key parties prior
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.200]   to our filing with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.240]   The key elements of that plan are listed on slide seven.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.880]   It will allow us to make the necessary investments in our episode gas of mass system
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.000]   and reflect those investments and rates in a reasonably timely manner.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.100]   We are thankful that the DPU approved the settlement
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.620]   and the acquisition very quickly.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.180]   Now that we have the keys to the property and a long-term plan in place,
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.900]   we have focused on providing our new Eversource gas customers with the same high level
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:06.320]   of service that we provide our other 550,000 natural gas distribution company customers
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.200]   that we have in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.460]   As I noted earlier, we plan to integrate Eversource gas
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:20.160]   of Massachusetts into our updated 5D projections that we'll provide you in February.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.660]   We continue to project approximately $3 billion of regulated company capital investments this year.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:33.820]   Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and the need to take crews off of capital projects
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:39.440]   for a significant part of August to deal with the aftermath of tropical storm east IEAS.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:46.180]   Through September, our capital investments totaled approximately $2.2 billion.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:52.180]   That's approximately the same level as this time last year in 2019.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.200]   We made considerable progress on our transmission capital program
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.900]   in the third quarter, putting several projects into service at or below budget.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:08.800]   These benefits of lower cost will slow through to New England's electric customers.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:15.860]   From the regulated business, I'll turn to offshore wind partnership with Orsted on slide 8.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.760]   We've had a few developments since our July 31st earnings call.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.720]   The most significant development was that in August, the Bureau
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.520]   of Ocean Energy Management posted a complete review schedule
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.180]   for our 130 megawatt south fork project on Long Island.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.880]   The schedule culminates in a decision on a construction
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:46.420]   and operations permit or COP as it's known in mid January of 2022.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.200]   We are also making progress on the other permits.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.840]   In September, we filed a settlement proposal with the New York Department of Public Service
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.720]   to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the construction operations
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.920]   and maintenance of the project that lies within New York jurisdiction.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.880]   In October, several of New York State agencies signaled their support
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.800]   for this proposal by signing on to the agreement.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.380]   We've structured an agreement on host community payments
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.720]   in the necessary real estate rights with the town of East Hampton
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.940]   where the offshore cable will land and will be connected to the Long Island grid.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.980]   New York Public Service Commission citing hearings
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.700]   for south fork is scheduled to commence the first week of December.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:42.640]   We continue to expect the state signing process to be completed in 2021
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.160]   before bone issues the COP.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.340]   Based on that schedule, we now expect the project end
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.080]   to service in the fourth quarter of 2023.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.220]   This is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our May
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:02.560]   and July earnings calls while we were still waiting for the review schedule.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.260]   During our other projects, you recall that we filed our bone application
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.480]   for Revolution Wind in March.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.000]   We expect bone to establish a review schedule for that project in the first quarter
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.140]   of 2021.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:22.860]   We do not expect to provide an updated in service date for this project
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.720]   until the schedule is issued, but at this point, it's unlikely
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.600]   that the project will have to service by the end of 2023.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.480]   Also, we filed our sunrise wind application with bone on September 1
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.220]   and expect bone to establish a review schedule for the project next year.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.080]   Once we receive that review schedule, we'll be able
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.700]   to better estimate a more up-to-date in service schedule.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.700]   But again, at this time, it would seem that the end
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.280]   of '24 in service is not likely.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:00.320]   We're very optimistic about our offshore wind business and expect
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.940]   to have many opportunities over the coming months and years
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.080]   to expand our offshore wind partnership
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.340]   beyond the 1700 and 14 megawatts currently on the contract.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:17.420]   As we mentioned before, we have enough leaf capacity to construct at least 4000 megawatts
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.580]   on the 550 square miles of ocean tracks that we have
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:26.620]   under long-term leaf off the southeast coast of Massachusetts.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:32.120]   To this point, on October 20th, we submitted a number
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.460]   of alternative bids into the second New York offshore wind IRSP
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.780]   where the state is looking for between 1000 and 2500 megawatts.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.760]   New York state officials have indicated that they expect
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.440]   to announce the winners before the end of the year.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.100]   Our sunrise project, as a reminder, won the largest portion
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.480]   of New York's first IRSP last year, 880 megawatts.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:06.540]   Additionally, just last week, Rhode Island Governor Gina Romando,
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.240]   announced that her state will target early next year
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.300]   for issuing an IRSP to 600 megawatts of additional offshore wind.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.660]   As you know, the majority of our revolution wind capacity,
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.700]   400 megawatts, will be sold to Rhode Island
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.040]   with the balance going to Connecticut.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.460]   Thank you very much for joining us this morning
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.560]   and I'll turn the call back over to John.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.760]   >> Thanks Phil and I'll turn the call back to John just
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.260]   to remind you how to enter questions in the Q&A queue.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.420]   >> Thank you.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.920]   If you do have a question, press star
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.560]   than one on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.840]   Once again, that's star than one on your touchtone phone.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.080]   If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.860]   or the hash key.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.880]   >> Thank you John.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.180]   Our first question this morning is from Shah from Guggenheim.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.300]   Good morning Shah.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.700]   Good morning Jeff, good morning Phil.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.880]   >> Good morning Shah.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.840]   >> So a couple questions here, just some of your language
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.720]   around sort of the growth rate, you know obviously
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.640]   which still excludes Columbia Gas and offshore wind.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.280]   Obviously these are, you know, very creative
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.320]   and you're already conservatively kind of well within your band.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.260]   So should we sort of be thinking about these incremental items
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.080]   as potentially rating your growth rate to maybe 6% to 8% or something
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.460]   that will hit you to the top end and then sort
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.360]   of extend that runway with your current trajectory?
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.480]   I mean the reason we ask is 6% to 8% seems to be sort
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.920]   of that new top quartile bucket in our space
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.240]   where 5% to 7% is becoming a little bit more typical.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.920]   So here's how you're sort of thinking about this.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.480]   Do you see value to be in the top quartile
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.200]   or you don't think you need to reward it for it?
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.860]   So I'm curious on that as we think about you layering its plan.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.440]   >> Sure, sure thanks for the question and I hope you are doing well.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:10.520]   Certainly the addition of Columbia Gas and we'll be additive
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.280]   to our existing forecast.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.360]   So we're working through all the details of that so we're able
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.920]   to provide you with a full update in February
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:26.880]   but we expect to get significant benefits from that franchise
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.240]   and say we also expect as those offshore wind projects come
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:39.040]   on line to also be additive, to remind folks, I know I said it
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.080]   but and you did, that the 5% to 7% growth rate is
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.600]   from the existing core business
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.200]   which doesn't include Columbia assets.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:55.000]   It also doesn't include grid modernization activities
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.380]   that are currently pending in Connecticut and New Hampshire
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:07.740]   or AMI that could be a potential to move forward relatively soon
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:13.000]   in Massachusetts in terms of taking a look at that by the regulator.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.320]   So I see that we have a number of levers to grow
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.880]   and grow at even a higher rate than we expected before.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.560]   Got it, that's helpful.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.360]   And then just lastly for me is can you just maybe talk a little
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:34.480]   bit about your expectations for the legislation in Connecticut?
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.800]   I mean the legislation
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.880]   that passed was more constructive than the draft legislation
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.920]   but obviously some disappointment with the refunds
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.600]   and penalties offset by the potential upside from like PBRs.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.400]   So how are you guys thinking about this entirely?
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:59.240]   Sure, the energy legislation we said consistently that PBR is a formula
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.520]   and a template that we think is effective.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.320]   We have PBR structures in other states
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:13.440]   and we think that having a robust discussion on PBR
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.560]   in Connecticut makes a lot of sense
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.480]   so we're very supportive of that provision.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:25.880]   You know really the energy legislation directed Pura to evaluate that
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:32.280]   and open a docket by the middle of next year so June of 2021
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:37.880]   and it authorizes Pura to establish storm standards
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.640]   and potential penalties as you mentioned.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:46.880]   There is an increased potential of penalties currently.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.440]   Those penalties are two and a half percent
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.560]   of our distribution revenues in Connecticut
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.480]   and that goes up to four percent.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.720]   So you know it also gives Pura some additional time
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.760]   to review cases so you know which is also something
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.880]   that you know seems to be appropriate.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:10.600]   So the legislation as you indicated is out there
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.560]   and Pura is working through the details of it
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.680]   and we expect to be working through that in a constructive way
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.040]   with them over the next several months.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.000]   >> Got it, terrific.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.080]   That's all I had today.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.360]   Thanks guys.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:24.920]   >> Thanks.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.280]   >> Thanks Sharke.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.760]   Our next question is from Steve Fleischman from Wolfe.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.040]   Good morning Steve.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.320]   >> Good morning.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.800]   Phil, can you hear me?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.520]   >> Yes Steve, I can.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.280]   >> Yeah, great.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.160]   So just a question on the delays
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.720]   in your offshore wind projects.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.480]   Could you maybe talk to, I know we don't know the exact timing,
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.600]   but how should we think about the impact on the economics
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:03.240]   of those projects from delay or puts and takes
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.760]   and is it hurting the economics
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.920]   of the projects you already have signed up to?
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.640]   >> Yeah, thanks Steve for your question Stephen.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.720]   I hope you and your family are doing well.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:20.760]   I guess to go to the puts and takes piece, you know,
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.400]   I don't think that folks should automatically think
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.480]   that schedule changes result in ups or downs.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:35.280]   There's some benefits or that people may not consider in that.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:41.320]   So certainly if you are looking at adjusted schedules,
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.040]   you might be able to adjust your installation vessel
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.160]   optimization better, you know,
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.360]   the turbine sizes themselves are getting larger
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:59.360]   so you could move to larger turbine sizes if projects are due
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.160]   at a later time period versus an earlier time period
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:07.720]   and certainly the cost supply chain and availability
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.080]   of materials and supply chain is only getting better.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.920]   So I would say that, you know, there's opportunities
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:21.280]   for improved cost economics as you move into a schedule
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.640]   that you may not think of.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.400]   You know, I think people generally think of projects as,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.960]   you know, physical delay.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.800]   It's a cost increase, but there are other elements
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.920]   that work here on the offshore wind business that offset that.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.080]   >> How about any negatives?
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.960]   Is it how about like do you lose,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.520]   are you going to lose any tax credits or anything else?
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.200]   >> Yes, certainly.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.960]   >> I guess just time value?
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.360]   >> Yes. In terms of the schedules we're looking at,
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.880]   we don't expect to have any impact on our tax assumptions,
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:01.240]   but certainly significant delays, delays could have impacts
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.960]   on your tax assumptions, delays could also have impacts
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.120]   on contracts that you have with counter parties,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.080]   but in our specific case, so that's the general case,
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.920]   in our specific case we're confident that we have the ability
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.960]   to work within both of those, the tax area
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.720]   and the contract area in an effective way
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:31.160]   with where we see the schedules going in the future.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.520]   >> Okay, thank you.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.480]   >> Thank you.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.800]   Our next question is from Angie from Seaport Global.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.240]   Good morning Angie.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.720]   >> Good morning.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.600]   So I have a question about Massachusetts.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.400]   You know, they've had this very constructive decision
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.760]   for MSR gas, but the state is clearly looking
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.480]   up to the future of gas LDCs.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.880]   And so how do you guys see it, especially in light
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:06.120]   of the fact that you just acquired an additional gas utility
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.240]   in Massachusetts?
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.680]   >> Good morning Angie and thank you for your question
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.240]   and hope you're doing well.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.800]   You know, the way that I was positioning it or the way
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.000]   that I think people should think about it is
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.400]   that there's nobody first of all who's more aggressive in terms
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.880]   of looking at clean energy strategies and carbon reduction
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.200]   than ever sourced in terms
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.920]   of having carbon neutral goals like 2030.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:41.000]   We have worked effectively with all parties in all states,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.160]   but in Massachusetts where the Attorney General
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.480]   and others want to take a look at, you know, sort of the future
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.720]   or the outlook in terms of the gas business,
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.760]   we've been working with these intervening parties for many years
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.720]   and we'll continue to work with them
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.200]   on what we think an appropriate strategy is there.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:10.240]   So this is a long-term outlook in terms
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.000]   of that the state wants to, you know,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.960]   have aggressive clean energy
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.720]   and carbon reduction targets with wholly supportive of that
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.800]   and we look forward to working, you know,
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.840]   with all the parties there.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.440]   But we don't see it as a threat
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:34.120]   to the gas distribution business in the region at all.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   >> Okay and in Connecticut, you know, there's this recent back
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.440]   and forth between you guys and Porra about the expansion
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.880]   of the lack of basically disconnections on the back of COVID.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.320]   I mean, it sounds a bit concerning that Porra's pushing back
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.600]   so strong that they don't need to sign off on that extension.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.160]   I mean, I would assume that it's an actual practice,
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.280]   normal practice for a regulated utility to seek recovery
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.880]   of these, you know, unrecovered revenues.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.240]   I mean, can you give us a sense, you know,
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.160]   how you see it in Connecticut given the latest, you know,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.000]   legislative changes and also some deterioration
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.640]   and, you know, negative relationships in the state?
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.560]   >> Yes. So we are not doing shutoffs across all,
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.920]   any of our franchises at this point
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.200]   and specifically, you know, we're working, you know,
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.200]   we're working with customers.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.560]   We're working with fuel agencies, assistance agencies
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.440]   on an approach here that works, that works best for customers.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.920]   We've also engaged with Pura as you mentioned
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.880]   and other government officials, you know, on this issue.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.320]   So I'm confident that we'll get to a good place here.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.760]   You know, nobody wants to burden customers with any more
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.520]   than we're all, all of us are burdened with in terms
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.040]   of the economic conditions and COVID, et cetera.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.920]   So we're working through the issue, we're working with customers
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.000]   as I say and some of the assistance agencies
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.920]   and I'm sure we'll get to a good outcome here.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.440]   >> Very good.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.480]   >> Thank you, Angie.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.120]   Next question is from Julian from Bank of America.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.080]   Good morning Julian.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.600]   >> Hey, good morning team.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.400]   Thanks for the time.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.720]   I hope all of you are doing well and safe with families as well.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.840]   Perhaps just to pick up off of, or perhaps clarify if I can,
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.560]   some of the last rounds of questions.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.160]   When you talk about the 4Q roll forward,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.520]   are you going to be rolling to 2025 and then more specifically,
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.360]   how do you think about including or excluding offshore wind
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.600]   in light of the uncertainty described?
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.120]   Should we expect that offshore wind should continue to be at least
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.920]   for those projects where there's an undetermined date
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.080]   to continue to be excluded there?
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.520]   >> Julian, thanks for your question and your comments
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.040]   that I hope you and your family are doing well too.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:20.320]   Just to clarify, we will, our history has been to add another year
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.560]   into the outlook so 2025 would be that year
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.000]   since our forecast goes through the 2024 time period
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.640]   so that is something that you should expect to see.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.240]   And really our view on how to look at offshore wind,
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.440]   it doesn't change by any of the schedule items we talked
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:47.560]   about today or if we've looked at it as showing the core business
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:53.120]   as the driver and the foundational element of the growth rate
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.120]   and then to show that wind is attitude to that in what way.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.560]   So that would be the intent going forward.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.680]   I think that what I've been asked this question before,
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:11.520]   the answer is was and still is, as more years of wind come
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.200]   into the actual results of that particular year,
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.160]   then to me it makes more sense to roll it all together.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:24.360]   But at this stage the expectation especially in this upcoming
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.040]   February update would be to have the core business extend
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:37.920]   that through 2025 and then show offshore wind in addition to that.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.560]   >> And if you don't mind elaborating a little bit further,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.880]   I know that there's a certain degree
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.920]   of uncertainty on exactly the permming schedule
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.240]   that inhibits your ability to say when these projects
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.160]   in a return service can you at least try to put some more parameters
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.920]   around what each of these pieces of the process could take
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.120]   such that there's like a window if you will?
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.920]   It may be too early.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:08.000]   >> Yeah, so in terms of, you know, people have realized out there
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.440]   and we've been asked questions.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.240]   I think you've asked us the questions in terms of, you know,
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.880]   with delays on vineyard wind and other things there's been some delays
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:26.720]   in terms of bone notice of intent to prepare their environmental impact
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:33.040]   statement and frankly we would have expected in our original schedule
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.640]   that some of these NOIs, you know,
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.480]   to prepare the environmental impact statement would be out by now.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   So these are expected, I believe, you know, the planned schedule
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.360]   for reviewing and releasing these is underway.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.560]   So I wouldn't expect, you know,
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.800]   a significant change in the schedule
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.040]   but at this stage it would be prudent to wait
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.120]   to see the schedule that comes out of the bone before we commit
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.840]   to a final inservice date.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:13.200]   >> I wouldn't expect it to be significant.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.240]   >> Got it, excellent.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.360]   All right, I'll pass it from there.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.920]   Thank you so much, Steve.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.200]   >> Thanks Julian.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.080]   Next question is from Durgash from Evercore.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.720]   Good morning Durgash.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.920]   >> Hey, good morning guys.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.120]   Thanks for taking my question.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.600]   Just following up on, you know, the offshore wind here.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:38.320]   What do you expect, you know, there's this EIS decision I suppose
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.520]   that is going to be out or EIS date and rather this month
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.920]   or early December, what do you expect there
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:49.680]   and then how does that impact your future project timelines?
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.600]   >> Yeah, the, you've noticed a bit of intense
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.320]   that they contain a planned schedule, you know,
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.120]   that in those NOIs they have contained bones planned schedule
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.280]   for reviewing each of the clocks.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.040]   So that would be an important piece of information
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.320]   to have available.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.080]   So that's really what's included in that.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.840]   It's a planned schedule for reviewing the clock
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.680]   that comes out with the notice of intense.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.480]   >> All right, so I guess maybe I'm talking
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.800]   about the environmental impact statement.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.520]   Isn't there an environmental impact statement
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.840]   that Bohm is supposed to sort of put
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.440]   out here in the next few weeks?
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.880]   >> You're talking about the one for Vineyard, right?
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.440]   >> Yes, yes, yes.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:44.480]   >> Oh, okay, yeah, I'm not, I apologize,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.800]   you probably have to ask Vineyard Wyndham about that.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.640]   >> Okay, but that doesn't have a read through for you
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:57.280]   or your offshore wind project, I guess that's what my question was.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.000]   >> Well certainly all of the developers off the coast,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.640]   you know, we've been going through this cumulative impact study
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:12.040]   and looking at spacing and of wind turbines and we came
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.760]   up with a one nautical mile by one nautical mile spacing
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.120]   so certainly there could be components that come
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:24.640]   out in any decision for Vineyard Wynd that you'd have
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.680]   to take a look at see if it has any impact, you know,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.600]   to all the developers including us, but in terms
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.720]   of what might be in that or the exact timing,
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.480]   I think Vineyard might have a better perspective of that.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.480]   >> Okay, perfect, that's all I had guys, thank you so much.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.920]   >> All right, thanks Dorgesh.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.200]   Next question is from Jeremy from J.T. Morgan.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.440]   Good morning Jeremy.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.680]   >> Good morning, thanks for having me.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.920]   I just wanted to start off with what are the benefits
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:04.960]   of looping ConEd into the proposed Sunrise Wind 2 RFP here?
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.200]   Every source has the experience of building transmission
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.080]   and we're curious what additional competitive advantages ConEd
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.720]   provides here to this specific project.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.680]   Can you provide details on potential ownership interests
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.840]   for each entity and does ownership interest change
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.720]   once construction is complete and the project is in service?
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.080]   >> Thanks for the question Jeremy, hope you're doing well.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.200]   I guess I would say on the first part of the question,
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:38.480]   sort of obviously ConEd has local knowledge of New York
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.720]   and their service territory and the network and the operation
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:48.800]   of the transmission and delivery system that are valuable
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.960]   to any party if you're operating in New York.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:59.240]   So I say they bring a knowledge and skill set of the area
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:04.400]   that certainly we don't have as depth of knowledge
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.720]   as they would, so sort of skill sets there
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.880]   that the local player would bring.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:18.920]   So in terms of what the components of a relationship would be
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.520]   those things are all to be discussed as we move through,
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.240]   but it's certainly beneficial I think to the project
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:38.760]   to have somebody with ConEd skill sets involved.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.880]   >> Got it, and as far as potential ownership interest
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.640]   is there any kind of thoughts on how that could develop?
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.000]   >> Not at this time, no.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.600]   >> Got it, and then will the delay in offshore wind permitting
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.040]   have any impact on the current financing plans?
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.600]   Is it fair to assume the 700 million of equity
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.800]   and your current private plan moves to the back end here
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.240]   and how is offshore wind catbacks spending track feeder date
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:13.560]   versus the 300 to 400 million range that you expected?
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.800]   >> We haven't disclosed a range that we've expected.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.680]   We've talked about how much we expected to spend, you know,
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:28.600]   this year, you know, just for the year 2020,
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.480]   and it's tracking somewhat close to that I'd say
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:37.680]   is probably a little bit under what we expected at this time.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.640]   In terms of the financing, you're right that we announced
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.280]   a year ago, you know, this $2 billion of equity need
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.000]   that would support the forecast,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.440]   and we issued 1.3 of that, so there's 700 million remaining
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.280]   that-- and I would say the same thing as I've said all along
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.240]   as we'd be opportunistic and consider what our capital
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:07.600]   forecasts are and what the market conditions are.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.080]   You know, as we look to fulfill the rest
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.960]   of that offering that we discussed.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.280]   >> Got it.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:16.880]   That's helpful.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.480]   I'll leave it there.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.560]   Thank you.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.040]   >> Great.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.760]   Thanks, Jeremy.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.880]   Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glen Rock.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.600]   Good morning, Paul.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.080]   Good morning, guys.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.600]   >> Good morning, Paul.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.760]   >> I just wanted to follow up on the draft decision
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:39.600]   in Connecticut on Monday and what your thoughts were on it.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.640]   Any-- if it were, in fact, to become a final order,
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.880]   what the potential impact could be?
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.760]   >> Are you talking about the draft information on rates
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.840]   or can you be more specific?
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.800]   >> Sure. There was a draft decision on Monday
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.240]   in the PERA case associated with the rates, right?
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.880]   The rate review that was reversed, that proceeding,
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.680]   I can tell you the specific name.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   >> No, that's okay.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.360]   You know, I just wanted to be specific
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.800]   because as somebody else mentioned,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.920]   there's been a number of different--
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.760]   >> Yeah, I measure a lot.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.560]   >> So this-- so as you recall, we--
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.520]   the purest suspender of the rates
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.960]   that we had implemented over the summer both we
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.680]   and UI to take an additional look.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.480]   I think this is what you're referring to.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.240]   So we did receive the draft order
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.240]   and really it's kind of hot off the press
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:48.600]   but currently evaluating that and we're going to, you know,
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.200]   see what comments we might have
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.040]   and comments on the draft could do.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.000]   I think it's the 12th of November
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.120]   so we have some time to flush out anything
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.360]   but it's consistent with--
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.720]   on first blush, I'd say, it's consistent
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:10.240]   with the purest desire to have some rate changes.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.400]   You know, instead of implementing rates
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.240]   at peak times of usage maybe such as July, implement them on,
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.080]   you know, change the time of it to implement it maybe
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:25.200]   in a shoulder month like May or something
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.400]   and move to annual reconciliations
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.360]   as opposed to semi-annual.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:35.920]   So this would, you know, if there's delay this could have--
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.480]   effectively this is a cash flow item
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.080]   and it could have an impact on our deferrals
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.960]   that we have in place there but, you know,
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.040]   I think it's generally consistent with the desire
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.840]   as we said to move off of these peak periods
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.240]   for making rate changes into shoulder periods
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.800]   and see what we go from there
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.200]   but we're actively reviewing that last night and today
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.440]   and we'll be-- and have any comments
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.560]   that we would have to do as I said on the 12th.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.640]   Okay, there was one part of it
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.720]   that would reduce the carrying charges
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.080]   from the-- from lack to a prime rate
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.520]   on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.720]   Is there any-- do we have any--
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.160]   I know this is off the press and everything
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.200]   but do we have any sort of forecast as to what the--
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.440]   those reconciliation mechanisms, like how much capital
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.640]   might be tied up in those?
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.880]   No, that you did-- that is a point too,
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.840]   the carrying cost at prime
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:49.120]   which is consistent in some of the jurisdictions I guess.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:55.200]   So no, it's not the significant, you know, item
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.480]   but it's certainly one that Pure had put out there
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   in the draft is to recover the deferred balances
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:07.880]   with a prime rate versus a lack.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:12.280]   Okay, and then just we don't know
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.200]   who the president's going to be at scenes
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.400]   but if there was a change in administration
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.760]   do you think that could have or not have
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.640]   maybe a significant impact on the OEM
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.760]   permitting process with respect to offshore wind?
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:36.000]   The permitting process, I mean, when we meet with BOM,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   you know, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.600]   you know, that people are active, we're actively working,
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.880]   we're actively having, you know, Zoom meetings
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:55.240]   or team calls or whatever the video capabilities are
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.480]   that we're using but, you know, we're actively working that
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.200]   and I can assure you that the people in the agencies
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   are working full speed regardless of, you know,
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:10.720]   who's, you know, president or what the election results are
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.280]   but certainly it would be good to have, you know,
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.200]   the results of the election, I think we've all as a country,
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.560]   you know, that the election results
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.720]   are something that we've all targeted out there
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.760]   and wherever you fall on the political spectrum
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.920]   it's good to have certainty as opposed to uncertainty
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.400]   so I think we're all looking forward
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.680]   to what the final outcome is there
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.080]   so we can move forward.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   Okay, so for my clarity, the process of the BOM
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.600]   that's pretty much the agency, the sort of bureaucratic process
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.920]   that's going on, really, you don't see a significant change
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.680]   one way or the other, regardless of the outcome
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.800]   of the presidential election, is that my understanding of that?
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.480]   Yeah, I'd say that the work at the agencies is going on there,
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.640]   you know, we've been meeting regularly,
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.840]   going through questions, we're working through
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.360]   about the various state agencies, so no, I'd say that the work
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:18.640]   is continuing at the, as you say, the bureaucratic level.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.080]   Okay, awesome, thanks so much.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.400]   Thanks Paul.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.000]   Next question is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.960]   Good morning Mike.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.080]   Hey, good morning.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.640]   Morning Phil.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.520]   Good morning Mike.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.760]   All right, good, I hope you're doing well.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.680]   Yeah, maybe you could just give a quick two-second update
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.880]   on what you think the outcome at FERC might be
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.800]   for transmission ROEs, considering, I don't know,
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.320]   if the election outcome maybe has any effect
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:56.200]   on any of this accelerating an outcome.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:01.880]   Well Mike, that's a very big crystal ball that you're asking.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:06.080]   So, but again, thanks and I hope you're doing well,
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.600]   thanks for your question.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:13.920]   You know, I wish I had a better answer than to say
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.760]   that, you know, it's working its way through.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:25.800]   We don't really have a specific clarity as to when FERC might,
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.240]   you know, come up with something on the New England before
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:33.800]   pending New England cases and certainly impact
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   of the election one way or the other,
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:39.320]   what that could have in terms of commissioners
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.240]   and that type of thing.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.800]   So, you know, the only thing I know for certain
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:48.720]   is we're looking at our 10.57 rates
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:55.240]   and I'm observing to that level an 11.74 cap
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.280]   and, you know, we'll just have to wait and see
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.240]   what the final outcome we'll look at,
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.440]   but I don't really have any answer.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.920]   I know in years past when I tried to think
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.600]   that one was coming or it was going a certain way,
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:14.200]   it really hasn't materialized so I think it's best
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.120]   to wait for the final order comes out at this point
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.280]   on board or as it may be.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   >> Right, and a bigger crystal ball question would be,
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.560]   you know, I know that Hydro Quebec has a pretty big long-term
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:33.280]   construction plan for, you know, hydro generation up there
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.080]   and I know that their long-term plans included lots
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.840]   and lots of northern past type transmission lines.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.480]   You know, do you think there's ever a time at some point
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.680]   where there might be another whack or another go
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:51.280]   at transmission at some point, you know, big transmission project?
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.480]   >> I think a lot of that is dependent
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.760]   on what the states want to get, right?
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.480]   So these are going to be processes now that are driven
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.920]   by states clean energy policies and the states desire
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:11.160]   to have either offshore wind or solar or hydro in the mix.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:16.520]   So, you know, there certainly is a lot of activity
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:23.480]   at the states now, I mean the states in our area all want aggressive
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.520]   carbon reduction targets so we wouldn't be asked a question
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.160]   to see if states, you know, want to, you know,
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.360]   contract for more of that but there's nothing planned
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.760]   on our end, there's nothing that I see at this stage
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.080]   on the states agenda that would say that but when you say
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:44.680]   the word ever, you know, that's a long time.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.000]   So it seems like the offshore wind program really is kind
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.920]   of supplanted that, at least at the time being.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.640]   >> Yeah, I think that's a good way of looking at it.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.600]   >> Okay, great.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.120]   Thank you very much.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.760]   >> Okay, thanks Mike.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.600]   Our next question is from Insu Kim from Goldman Sachs.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   Good morning Insu.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.760]   >> Good morning guys.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.560]   My only question is and apologize if I missed this
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.240]   but could you give just an update
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.200]   on the Connecticut grid mod filings and any updates
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.080]   on expected decision from the Commission and, you know,
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.160]   timing of investments, et cetera.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:23.400]   >> Thanks for your question Insu and I hope you
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.280]   and your family are doing well.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   You did not miss it, I mentioned, you know,
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.360]   in terms of what items could be additive
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   to our five to seven percent core business growth rate
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.680]   I alluded to grid mod in Connecticut
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:47.640]   or New Hampshire or potentially additional AMI dockets
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.240]   in Massachusetts but there's really been no change
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:57.800]   that we all the parties filed comments and plans back in July
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.320]   and certainly you can understand there's been a lot going on
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.920]   and I think I may have said East IEIS was in October
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   but we all know that East IEIS was in August.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:13.360]   So since August there's been a lot of, you know,
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.880]   there's been a lot of focus on storms
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.120]   and there's been a lot of dockets
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:20.880]   and as somebody else mentioned we have dockets going on
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.680]   in terms of moratoriums and whatnot.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.600]   So this, you know, the expectation was there was going
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.440]   to be another sort of go round in another process
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.680]   in Connecticut towards the end of the year.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.200]   I really haven't seen anything that would indicate
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:43.040]   a specific schedule, you know, on that so I guess our best guess
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:46.880]   is still, you know, it's still in the pipeline
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:51.280]   and you may see more activity on grid mod there in Connecticut
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.680]   as we move over the next several months.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:59.480]   But in terms of being in our forecast, you know,
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:04.000]   I want to be clear that there is currently no, you know, zero,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.640]   there's no grid mod spending in our capital forecast
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.200]   for any, you know, grid mod programs that haven't been approved
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.640]   like in Connecticut or New Hampshire.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.240]   So, you know, once they are approved
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.280]   and once we see what our role would be in them
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:25.000]   and once we see what that, you know, looks like then
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.840]   we have more confidence in putting in the plan.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.640]   So that could be something we have information on
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.960]   by the time we get to the February update.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:41.080]   So, you know, we'll have to stay tuned on that.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.280]   That makes sense.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.520]   That's all I had. Thank you guys and stay safe.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.480]   All right, you too. Thanks, Andrew.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.000]   Next question is from David Arkaro from Morgan Stanley.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.880]   Morning, David.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.120]   Morning. Hi, Jeff. Hi, Phil.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.880]   Thanks so much for taking my question.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:01.680]   And a quick follow-up on offshore wind, you know, in light
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.920]   of some of the recent delays, I was wondering if that changes
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.760]   how you're strategizing around other bids
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:12.000]   that you're putting into future RFPs like baking
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.480]   in more contingency, anything that might give a greater level
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.280]   of comfort around the economics of future projects
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.600]   that you might win.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.920]   Thank you, David, for your comment
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:29.120]   and I hope you're doing well. Certainly, every piece
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.600]   of information that you get, you know,
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.280]   and this isn't just offshore wind, you know,
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.560]   this is, you know, on all our business,
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.440]   but I'll focus on offshore wind since that's the question.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.000]   You know, every month it goes by, every quarter it goes by,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.600]   we gain more insight and information about construction,
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:53.920]   about, you know, rates about, you know,
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.880]   lots of factors, if all of those things,
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.960]   all of those things are factored into subsequent bids,
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.480]   so the information that we have available to us,
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:06.000]   you know, as we're moving into a bid,
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.920]   recent bid in New York is different than we had
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.560]   from bids that we made, you know, in Rhode Island
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.000]   or Connecticut or Massachusetts.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.800]   So every data point is important to us
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.040]   and we factor that into the next bid.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.640]   So I'd say that absolutely that schedules
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.960]   and how you make it through the citing process
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.840]   and all of that informs, you know,
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.200]   subsequent bids and so I can assure you
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.600]   that all those things get, you know,
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:42.360]   up to the minute attention before bid goes in.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.160]   Okay, got it. That's helpful and I just wanted to touch on
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.800]   just O&M costs and the O&M budget.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.560]   Could you remind us how you see that trajectory
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.600]   just for the overall business going forward?
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.200]   You've got a great track record of controlling O&M,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:03.360]   so what are the key levers in your tool belt
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:08.840]   so that you would focus on going forward for managing O&M?
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.800]   Sure. You know, we've got people processing technology,
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.920]   right, so all those things are levers
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.920]   to help, you know, our capital program
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.000]   as well as our operating program.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:27.200]   So, you know, we continue to implement systems
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.920]   and technology that improves processes
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:35.280]   that makes it more efficient and effective workforce.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:41.080]   So we have, you know, still a robust, I'd say,
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:44.640]   series of technology improvements.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.560]   If you -- I'll start off by just setting this phase.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:52.560]   In the guidance we gave, we said that we expected O&M costs
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.320]   to be, you know, down this year and then just for the forecast
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.640]   period kind of flat going forward.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.960]   So how are we able to do that?
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.040]   It is by some of these technology changes
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:10.760]   and we've been implementing more productivity management
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:14.320]   tools and tools for our, you know, individual line workers
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.200]   and gas bidders and in the field to get their work,
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:22.120]   to update their work that we can then take that
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.960]   and automatically update drawings and files
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.840]   we don't need, you know, to hand it off to somebody.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:32.920]   So there's still these productivity technology changes
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.360]   that are happening, some went in last year,
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.440]   some going in this year and more planned for next.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:43.240]   So that will be, like they said, a lever under the --
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.240]   underpinning for us to have the ability to continue
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:53.880]   to improve processes and take unneeded costs out of the business.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.400]   Okay, great.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:54.880]   That's helpful.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.800]   Thanks so much for the call.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.320]   You're welcome.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.680]   Thank you, David.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:03.120]   Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.680]   Morning, Travis.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.720]   Good morning. Thank you.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:10.000]   Quick clarification on the storm cost,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.400]   that $275 million number, if I heard you correctly,
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.160]   how much did you expense in the quarter
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.880]   and how much was either deferred or capitalized
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:27.360]   or will be pending the regulatory filing that you mentioned?
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:32.680]   Travis, that amount that you repeated was deferred,
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:36.880]   that's how much of a storm cost that we deferred
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:43.840]   for tropical storm ethias and that was across all states
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.600]   but primarily in Connecticut.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.160]   So that's our deferral.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.520]   That would be, you know,
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.400]   once the storm gets to a certain level,
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.120]   it triggers a deferral.
[00:59:54.120 --> 01:00:00.160]   So we -- that all is deferred storm cost right now.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.720]   In terms of -- there are other storms,
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.600]   certainly we had an active quarter for storms in general
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.000]   but there are other storms other than ethias
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.960]   that did impact the quarter.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.240]   I mean, our storm costs were up, you know,
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.760]   about $10 million for the quarter
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.880]   that went through our O&M.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.840]   So for the quarter it's at that level
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:32.280]   and then the 274 or 5 that you mentioned is deferred across the system.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.880]   Okay, great, that's very helpful, thank you.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.280]   And then a quick follow up to the discussion
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.200]   on the Connecticut legislation
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.000]   and there's some language in there as I understood it
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.920]   about the general assembly having some review power there.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.920]   What's your thought in terms of the scope
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.560]   of what the general assembly separate from Pura could do
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.200]   in terms of either taking back some earnings
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.600]   or rate changes, stuff like that separate
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.120]   from what's going on in the Pura?
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.360]   Well certainly the general assembly can enact legislation
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:14.320]   that it feels is appropriate in any matter so, you know,
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.120]   I do think specifically to the energy legislation
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:23.040]   that was enacted recently in Connecticut
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.840]   that most, you know, things all were, you know,
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.000]   for the most part moved to Pura, you know, so the regulator.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.240]   So I guess I'd look at it as the legislation would provide
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.080]   the intent, the framework, the direction
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.240]   and then Pura is the one who's going to be implementing,
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240]   you know, they're going to be the ones
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.440]   who evaluate the performance based rates.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.200]   They'll be the ones who initiate the storm, you know,
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.000]   standards and things like that and look at, you know,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.800]   should there be penalties or should there be food,
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.960]   you know, penalties and things like that.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.440]   So I think that effectively, you know,
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.240]   the general assembly can certainly enact any
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.520]   and all legislation it feels it should
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.280]   and the way that this legislation seems to have turned
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.440]   out was that any implementation
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.040]   of that legislation is in the hands of Pura.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.240]   >> OK, so the potential for any or the risk for any kind
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.160]   of clawbacks would likely go through Pura instead of going
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.280]   through the general assembly based on that kind
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:36.480]   of to get legislation that you talked about, right?
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.400]   >> Yeah, as I say, you know, the Pura,
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.080]   the dockets are active and will be active over, you know,
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.200]   there's a certain time date that the legislation has given Pura
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.280]   so I would expect that Pura will have the pen on this,
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.280]   but again, as I say, you know,
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:01.800]   legislation can always be enacted in any area.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.280]   >> Yep, yep, OK, great, appreciate.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.520]   >> All right, thank you Travis.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.960]   Next question is from Andrew Weisel from SCOSHA.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.360]   Good morning Andrew.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.400]   >> Hey, good morning.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.800]   Thanks for squeezing me in.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.720]   First question is with the two rate cases now completed,
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.040]   can you remind us which subsidiaries might be next
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.680]   to file general rate cases?
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.600]   You have plenty of regulatory items, of course,
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.040]   with grid mod and other initiatives,
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.640]   but for general rate cases?
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:41.040]   >> Well, according to the requirements in Connecticut,
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:46.080]   Connecticut could be an area that is required to file
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.160]   by the existing framework that's there and that would be
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.360]   something that would be sort of a, you know,
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.920]   next year sort of event,
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:03.320]   but other than that, we're pretty much out of the regulatory arena.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.640]   >> OK, great.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.280]   Then on offshore winds, can you just thinking, sorry,
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.080]   can you share your latest thinking on how big you're willing
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.760]   to let that business get?
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.600]   You've talked a lot about the opportunities
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.520]   that you're pursuing beyond the three existing projects.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.600]   Any thinking as far as from an earnings mix perspective,
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.360]   if there's a limitation or will you plan
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.520]   to just bid, bid, bid and get as many projects
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.160]   as your leases will support?
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.760]   >> Well, I want to be clear on this because I think it's a very
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:39.160]   important point that bid isn't that strategy.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.320]   Our strategy is to have a financial discipline
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.160]   about growing that business in a way
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.320]   that provides appropriate levels of return
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.760]   that benefit our shareholders.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:55.320]   So just by winning a bid, you know, doesn't do it.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.920]   It has to be, we have to and we continue
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.640]   to maintain financial discipline in terms
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.560]   of the amounts that we bid and the returns
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.840]   that we're looking for.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.960]   So as long as the returns are at an appropriate level
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:14.840]   for that business, it makes sense to make the bid,
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.920]   win the bid and expand the business there.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:25.560]   What we've said is our tracks, what we own off the coast
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.640]   of what we have access to in terms of the lease areas,
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.680]   you know, we could do about 4,000, at least 4,000 megawatts
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.480]   of offshore wind.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.960]   So there's kind of a, you know,
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.360]   that's the maximum capability that we have
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.400]   so it's not an infinite growth type of thing
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.360]   and we had indicated that when leases were available
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.480]   that they're not in our region
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.560]   and we were not interested in them.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.080]   So leases in our region, like the ones we're involved
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:01.400]   in are good but on the lease areas, you know, that's not for us
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.360]   in other parts of the mid-Atlantic, et cetera.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.760]   So we're constrained by the lease area and we're guided
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:16.440]   by the financial discipline on our bids and our returns.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.520]   >> Got it, that's really helpful.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.440]   I guess I should have said bid, bid, bid responsibly.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:24.000]   >> Okay, fine, yeah.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.920]   I hope you stay well, I'm just saying.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.440]   >> All right, Andrew, thank you very much.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.360]   That sort of wraps up today.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:37.080]   If you have any follow-up questions, please give us a call
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.400]   or send us an e-mail and we look forward to speaking
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:45.760]   and seeing many of you during the virtual EEI conference next week.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:50.560]   >> And thank you ladies and gentlemen,
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.080]   this concludes today's conference.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:56.120]   Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.520]   >> Thank you.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.040]   >> All right, thanks.

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.300]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SAG Third Quarter 2020
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.300]   Earnings Conference Call.
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.140]   At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.660]   Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at the
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.660]   time.
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.260]   If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.340]   touchstone telephone.
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.820]   As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.820]   Thank you.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.580]   I would like to turn the conference over to your house.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.640]   Mr. Brendan Freight, please go ahead.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640]   Thank you Grace.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.060]   Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review SAG's Third Quarter 2020 financial
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.060]   results.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.060]   On the call today we have Krista Herm, Chief Executive Officer and Taylor Smith, Chief Financial
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.060]   Officer.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.980]   Following Chris and Taylor's prepared comments, we will open the call for a question and answer
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.980]   session.
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.840]   Our Third Quarter Earnings Press Release was issued today after the market closed at approximately
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.660]   4.05 pm Eastern Time.
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.700]   As a follow-on to the Earnings Release, we published a supplemental financial information
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.380]   on our Investor Relations website.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.660]   We also furnished this document to the SEC on Formation.
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.340]   You can find all our Earnings documents on our Investor Relations website at zag.com in
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.700]   the quarterly results section under the financials tab.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.460]   We are recording this call and a podcast at the conference call will be archived at the
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.140]   Zag Investor Relations webpage under the Events tab for one year.
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.340]   To begin, we would like to remind everyone that the prepared remarks contain forward-looking
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.940]   statements and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.940]   questions.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.060]   These statements include, but are not limited to, our outlook for the company and statements
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.900]   that estimate or project future results of operations for the performance of the company.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.020]   These statements do not guarantee future performance and speak as of the date hereof.
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.660]   For more detailed discussion on the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.020]   from those projected in any forward-looking statements, we refer all of you to the risk
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.540]   factors contained in Zag's annual report on Form 10(k) and quarterly reports on Form 10(q)
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.340]   by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.580]   Zag assumes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements that may be made in today's release
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.580]   or call.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.660]   Please note that on today's call, in addition to discussing the GAAP financial results,
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.220]   we will discuss adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.060]   Explanation of Zag's use of this non-GAAP financial measure in this call and reconciliation
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.940]   between GAAP and non-GAAP measures required by SEC Regulation G is included in Zag's
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.980]   press release today, which again can be found on the Investor Relations website.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420]   The non-GAAP information is not a substitute for any performance measure derived in accordance
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.780]   with GAAP and the use of such non-GAAP measures has limitations, which are detailed in the
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.580]   company's press release.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.140]   And now I'd like you to turn the call over to Chris Tararno.
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.380]   Thanks, Brendan, and thank you to everyone on today's call.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.900]   We hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.620]   Firstly, let me start by thanking our entire Zag team across the globe.
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.820]   I'm extremely ploughed to see how our teams reacted through the quarter and never last
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.060]   side of serving our consumers and partners with quality products that protect and enhance
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.060]   their devices.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.380]   Over the course of the third quarter, it was pleasing to see our results improve significantly
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.020]   compared with the second quarter and exceed our expectations.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.560]   We are encouraged by our recent performance given the challenges we continue to face from
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.600]   the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.100]   Our work over the past several months, which has included reducing expenses, adapting our
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.380]   operations to the current retail environment and aggressively managing inventories has put
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.060]   the company in a much stronger financial position and provided a business with good momentum
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.300]   as we head into our busiest selling season.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.100]   Looking at our third quarter in more detail, as we discussed on our Q2 call in August, we
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.820]   saw a significant sequential uptick in sales through in June for both our protection and
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.640]   power categories as several of our larger customers reopened our doors and resumed more normalized
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.740]   store operations, with some sales through weeks even exceeding last year's levels.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.900]   This trend continued into July and consistently improved throughout August and September.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.780]   While our online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced earlier in the
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.060]   pandemic, when much of the brick and mortar was closed, it was still up nicely from a
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.020]   year ago and expanding this channel continues to be a priority for us.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.700]   With respect to our overall performance, Q3 revenue came in at $150 million compared to
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.700]   $147 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 21%.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.340]   This represents a nice improvement from the 28% year of year decrease in revenue we reported
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.900]   in the second quarter.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.420]   Despite the roughly $32 million drop in revenue compared with the third quarter last year combined
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.820]   with some gross margin headwinds from higher freight expenses, we delivered a adjusted EBIT
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.100]   up $15 million.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.580]   Thanks to cost saving measures we enacted early in the pandemic.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.540]   Taylor will go through in greater detail on the balance sheet, but I wanted to share a
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.680]   few highlights.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.760]   Despite significant market pressure from COVID-19, our account receivable DSO has improved compared
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.580]   to last year and Venturi declined compared to where we ended Q2.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.500]   We generated positive operating cash flow and we continue to reduce our quarterly net debt
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   balance on a year-over-year and sequential basis.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.460]   By taking quick decisive action back in April and more recently working closely with our
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.100]   retail partners under store reopening efforts, we have been able to successfully navigate
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.060]   through incredibly challenging market conditions, ensuring the financial viability of the company
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.500]   and position ourselves to exit these difficult periods as a stronger more nimble organization.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.660]   I now provide some additional color to our categories.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.820]   Starting with protection, we continue to build on our overall digital wellness strategy.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.940]   For a few years now, our HERO screen protector has been VisionGuard, a product that reduced
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.140]   exposure to high-energy visible blue lights that can have damaging effects without changing
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.980]   the screen colors or the peak resolution.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.900]   We have now sold over 10 million units with this technology.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.540]   In addition, all invisible sheen screen protectors produced this year and beyond now also include
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.380]   antimicrobial technology.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.380]   This includes our entire lineup for the new iPhone 12 which is now available in stores.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.580]   Earlier this year, we introduced our newest product geared towards our digital wellness
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.500]   strategy, a UV phone sanitizer which works with all mobile devices and kills up to 99.9
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.020]   percent of staff in E. coli surface bacteria.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.820]   Our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retailers and our
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.460]   consumers and has led to increasing sales through and greater shelf space with many of our accounts.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.340]   We've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to protect cases with good success,
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.860]   starting with the Samsung Galaxy S20 launch earlier this year and right through to the recent
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.540]   iPhone 12 launch.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.700]   All Gear 4 protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.740]   The combination of disenhancement, benefit and Gear 4's differential D3O impact technology
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.700]   is driving excitement amongst our consumers, especially as awareness of the brand and product
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.540]   scroll from our efforts to expand distribution.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.540]   With the new iPhone 12 Gear 4 is now available and growing across all of our carrier partners.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.220]   This expanded distribution accelerates to momentum in Gear 4 brand and I'm excited to see it continue
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.980]   to grow through 2021.
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.060]   In our power category, Mofi launched many exciting new products during Q3 including the introduction
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.740]   of a new line of wireless charging solutions.
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.700]   These innovations are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple devices
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.780]   in one central location.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.420]   In addition, last month we launched the new Mofi juice pack Kinect.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.900]   This new product represents an evolution of our popular juice pack allowing users to easily
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.940]   charge their phone on demand using a detachable battery feature that is not device specific
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.500]   and is used with or without the consumer's normal phone case.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.460]   Our Halo brand continues to perform well on QVC which has been a productive partnership
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.540]   and channel particularly given the number of consumers spending more time at home.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.580]   Q4 is a busy time for our brands with QVC and HSN with a number of earrings planned during
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.700]   the holiday periods.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.900]   Looking ahead with the majority of our US partner doors now open and weekly sales will continue
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.900]   to improve combined with solid direct-to-consumer trends we feel optimistic about our prospects
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.900]   for remainder of the year.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.220]   While there is still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact shopping behavior
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.420]   this holiday season including the effect on several countries in Europe that have recently
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.020]   implemented lockdowns we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on demand regardless
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.300]   of which channel our consumers choose to engage with the brands.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.700]   We are currently planning for quarter revenue to increase from third quarter levels and continue
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.420]   improving on the year over year declines we have experienced the past two quarters even
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:36.420]   as we are facing tough comparisons in last year's record Q4 sales.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.900]   I am confident in the long term course we have set for the company our efforts around antimicrobial
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.700]   UV sanitization and blue light protection are driven by our belief that consumers will increasingly
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.180]   look for solutions that will henge their digital wellness.
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.740]   We also believe another consumer priority will be increased productivity and comfort from
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.740]   home.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:59.340]   We will continue our focus on enhancing technology in our lives to accomplish these growing needs.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.580]   While it remains difficult to know when conditions will fully normalize and what impact COVID-19
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.300]   will have on the global economy and our industry I am confident that we have taken the right
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.860]   steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company.
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.700]   This includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin product and categories and simplify
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.680]   our core lines of business.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.020]   As a more nimble company Zag can better serve its retail partners and core consumers capitalizing
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.020]   on the tailwinds from the multi year rollout of 5G with the margin benefits from our branding
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.980]   category consolidation and generate increased value for our shareholders.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.180]   I will now hand the call over to Taylor.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.180]   Thanks Chris.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.420]   Since many details about quarterly financial performance were included in the supplemental
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.460]   financial information issued earlier today I would just like to take a few minutes to add
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.700]   some additional comments in our third quarter financial performance.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:53.300]   Q3 net sales decreased year over year by approximately 21% to $115 million.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.580]   After exiting a very difficult second quarter we saw good momentum throughout the third
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:03.780]   quarter as retail outlets continued to reopen and allow a more normal in store shopping experience.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.580]   That being said the residual effects of COVID-19 combined with the delay of the launch of
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:13.140]   the new Apple devices which pushed some orders into Q4 made it a difficult year over year
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.140]   compare.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.100]   Overall we are pleased with the momentum and sell through improvements we saw at retail
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.540]   which enabled us to increase sales by almost 50% on a consecutive quarter basis from $77
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.260]   million to $115 million.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.340]   Q3 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased year over year to 33%.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.080]   There were a number of puts and takes that impacted gross profit during the quarter including
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.140]   a benefit from net lower duty rates and expected duty refunds which I'll discuss in more detail
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.300]   in a second.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:47.300]   This benefit was offset by higher expedited air freight and increased air freight rates
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.500]   along with the sale of excess inventory at margins that were lower than our historical averages.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.980]   On the subject of duty refunds in early August we received an exclusion notice that duties
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:02.660]   paid on certain products imported from China starting in late 2018 may be subject to refund.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.620]   We worked closely with our customs broker to begin submitting refund documentation to US
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.620]   customs.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.820]   This work is ongoing and given the volume of imports from China since late 2018 we'll continue
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.500]   throughout the fourth quarter.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.180]   Based on the work completed to date we recorded a refund receivable at quarter end of approximately
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.620]   $5.4 million for duties paid that we expect to be refunded.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.580]   The income statement impacted this receivable offset by the balance sheet reduction from
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.300]   duties previously capitalized in inventory and then sold in Q3 2020 was a net income statement
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:39.620]   benefit of $1.7 million or approximately 140 basis points to gross profit margin during the
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.620]   quarter.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.020]   As I mentioned there is still quite a bit of work left to do during the fourth quarter
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.060]   to complete our remaining refund submissions and we'll provide an update on any additional
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.340]   refund upside on our next call.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:57.340]   Q3 operating expenses decreased 29% or approximately $12 million compared to last year.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.720]   The decrease was due primarily to the various cost cutting measures we implemented as a result
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.700]   of the expected COVID-19 impacts on demand.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.040]   Over the last several months we've made the conscious decision to bring some individuals
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.180]   back from furlough to support fourth quarter product launches and customer care but we continue
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:19.420]   to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult time.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.060]   Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million vs. $21 million in the prior year period.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.260]   The decline vs. last year is linked to decreased sales and reduction in overall gross profit
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.220]   margin for the reasons I mentioned.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.080]   These items were offset by the decreases in operating expenses that I just discussed.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.860]   Turning to the balance sheet compared to a year ago accounts receivable decreased 33%
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.900]   to $91 million due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.940]   However our DSOs improved significantly from 87 days to 73 days.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.220]   The quality of our receivables remains very good.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.340]   It was $80 million compared to $94 million at the end of the first quarter, a reduction
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.040]   of approximately $14 million.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.020]   During the third quarter we took a conservative approach to inventory as we closely monitored
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.340]   retail sell-through, customer forecasts and customer inventory levels to ensure we didn't
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.940]   overextend on inventory purchasing.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.700]   As a result we did incur some incremental expedited air freight charges due to increased demand
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.740]   at the end of the third quarter as retail sell-through improved.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.340]   At this point we will continue to closely monitor the factors and influence our purchasing
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:27.540]   forecasts but will continue to plan conservatively due to the continued uncertainties related to
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.180]   the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.980]   Despite the continued headwinds from COVID-19 during the quarter, we generated a third quarter
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.260]   operating cash flow of approximately $9 million compared to -11 million in cash from operations
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.500]   during the prior year period.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:47.100]   Net debt which is consolidated debt less cash decreased to $81 million compared to $97 million
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.780]   in Q3 last year and $85 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.980]   As we discussed on the last call, during April we amended our credit facility to increase
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:02.980]   the total amount available under the line of credit from $125 million to $145 million.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.660]   This expansion combined with the loan received under the CARES Act, the Q2 restructuring
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.780]   and cost-cutting initiatives we've undertaken gives us confidence that we'll successfully
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.180]   navigate the headwinds that COVID-19 has put on the business.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.420]   The capital allocation focused throughout the remainder of 2020 will remain on funding working
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.980]   capital needs and continuing to service our line of credit.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.660]   As we look to the fourth quarter of 2020, we definitely have better visibility now than
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.540]   we did when we last spoke in August.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:34.620]   However, COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty around worldwide retail demand.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.340]   Given this market uncertainty, we will not be providing annual guidance at this time.
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.180]   However, given our current view of customer orders and positive retail sell-through trends,
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.720]   we expect strong sequential net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth over the third quarter.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.980]   We expect 2020 year-to-date gross margins to improve during the fourth quarter, though
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.380]   as I mentioned, we'll see some pressure over the next few quarters compared to historical
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.820]   averages of mid-30s as we sell through our excess inventory.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.700]   We expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high-20s to low-30 million
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.580]   dollars for the fourth quarter.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.820]   No different than from many other companies, COVID-19 has been extremely disruptive to
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.820]   our business.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.700]   However, with the steps we've taken to restructure the business, reduce fixed costs, and ensure
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.100]   adequate liquidity, I'm confident the likes of this period impacted by COVID-19 is a much
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.660]   stronger company than when we entered.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.020]   With that, we will now open up the call for questions.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.540]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.740]   If you have a question at this time, please press start in the number one key on your
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.740]   touchstone telephone.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.680]   Again, that is start in the number one key on your touchstone telephone.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:44.260]   Your first question comes from the line of Elliot Alper from DA Davidson, your line is
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.260]   open.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.260]   Great.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.260]   Thank you.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.220]   Thanks for the info on just the sequential sales in the fourth quarter, I guess.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:57.060]   Could you talk about any trends, quarter dates specifically and specifically geographic sales
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.060]   mix?
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.100]   Are you seeing any material changes with sales and geographies that have lost restrictions
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.420]   compared to those that have more?
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:12.340]   Just a couple of notes, with Apple launch happening a little bit later than we had experienced
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:19.100]   previously, there was maybe $5 million of sales that shipped from Q3 into Q4, which obviously
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:24.140]   benefit the sequential look at revenue.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:29.980]   Overall, though, we're seeing really good sell through of the phones that seem to be doing
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.660]   very successful in market and obviously we're benefiting from that.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.220]   Q4 starting off really, really well.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:44.940]   In terms of geos, no material change in geo expansion, Chris mentioned, or geo mix, Chris
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.780]   mentioned on his prepared remarks that we are definitely seeing some headwinds at least
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.460]   in terms of shutdowns in some of our international locations.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:58.900]   However, the wireless dealers in those locations have been deemed as essential and so those
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.900]   have remained open.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:06.480]   So it remains to be seen as to how that's going to impact demand, but I think overall
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:13.140]   we're definitely seeing some strong signs that we're getting back to a more normal Q4
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.140]   experience.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:19.460]   Though obviously COVID remains a bit of a cloud over everything.
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.940]   Great.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.020]   Then aside from the Apple launch shifting into the fourth quarter, can you talk about
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.860]   the holiday season and what may be different this year versus historically and any implications
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.640]   that may have on the December quarter?
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.860]   Yeah, the one thing that we are starting to see is obviously the Black Friday seems to
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.980]   be more, some retailers are taking strategy which are spreading us out over a number of
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.660]   days, over the month, so that's something that's going to be different.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:53.140]   I think we're still going to see a pretty strong online attachment from both side.com and obviously
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:18:00.620]   through Amazon, but we're very, I would say, optimistic about the early sell-through and
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.740]   our screen protection and cases are quite strong and that's given that we still have a number
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.740]   of other devices to take the market actually this week.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:17.020]   So overall I think we have some good runway for the holiday season, Elliot.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.020]   Okay, great.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.020]   Thank you.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.020]   Thank you.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.020]   Thanks Elliot.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:26.620]   And once again, in order to ask the question, please press start then the number one on your
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.620]   touchstone telephone.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:33.100]   Your next question comes from Delinas Maddin from Titan Capital Management, your line is
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.100]   open.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.100]   Great, thank you.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:41.580]   I was hoping you could put a number on the expediting shipping cost that you incurred
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.780]   in the third quarter just to give us some better idea on how significant those were?
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:55.020]   Yeah, it was between $2 million and $3 million and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks,
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.220]   it was a bit of a balancing act with inventory where we're trying to run it down and sell
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.700]   through, picked up at the end, we didn't have to move quickly and unfortunately resulted
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.820]   in some expedited air freight charges.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:14.140]   And for the fourth quarter, are you expecting that to reoccur or have you caught up and you
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.980]   feel like you're in a better place now?
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.340]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.860]   I think we're still probably chasing a little bit of demand.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.940]   The one thing that's also impacted us no different than every other company that's importing from
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:34.900]   overseas is just generally freight rates have increased globally and so that's also impacted
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.900]   it.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.820]   But I think there's probably going to be a little bit of that, as I mentioned, it's a bit of a
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.820]   balancing act.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:46.500]   We definitely wanted to be careful given the pandemic and how much inventory we were planning
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.780]   and fortunately or unfortunately we've seen some upsides which is great, but we've had
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.460]   to chase those and so I think we're probably still chasing a little bit which will impact
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:20:00.580]   some of our Q4 sales and then also obviously the spend on freight.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.580]   Great.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:07.180]   I also wanted to ask if I could really quickly about the tariff situation and now with the
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:14.460]   Biden presidency, I know you've been moving some production out of China, does that change
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:21.540]   your view on moving production out of China or how are you thinking about this new regime?
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.460]   Yeah, I think Matt, it doesn't change our strategy.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:31.060]   Ultimately, we're looking to diversify across our CM base and make sure that we're setting
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:36.660]   the company up for continued business so we're still following the strategy and we've had
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:42.960]   a very good quarter where we've now successfully have piloted both screen protection and wireless
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.100]   power outside of China so it gives us that ability to be able to shift our supply chain
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.100]   when needed.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.940]   Obviously, China is still a big part of our strategy but what I like is we're not just looking
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.140]   at it from a tariff perspective now, we're really looking at it from a business continuity
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.140]   perspective.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.140]   Great.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.140]   Thank you both.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.140]   Thanks Matt.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.140]   Thanks Matt.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.140]   Thank you.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.860]   Once again, in order to pass the question, please press start in the number one on your
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.580]   touchstone telephone.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:26.940]   Gentlemen, I'm showing you for the question at this time, I would like to turn the conference
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.940]   back to Mr. Chris in hearing from any closing remarks.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.940]   Thank you.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.780]   Thank you everybody for joining our Q3 earnings report.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.220]   We look forward to updating you again on Q4.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.900]   Have a great evening everyone and stay safe.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.900]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.900]   Thank you all for joining.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.540]   We're now all disconnect.
